{"review": "Great book, used in homeschooling. This book is part of a history, bible, literature program.  It is used for the time period the story is based.  We are loving the book.  It is always nice to find a book on ebay that is way cheaper than purchasing brand new. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is one of the best Young Adult Literature books I have ever read and my 5th graders love it, too. They can connect to the main character in so many ways and, on top of it being a great tool to learn 5th grade reading and writing standards, they are learning so much about compassion, empathy, and inclusion!  Yay! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Esperanza means hope, and that's what this book is all about.  When everything Esperanza knows comes to a crashing halt because of a family tragedy, Esperanza has a lot of trouble adjusting to her new life.  Things are no longer easy for her, and she no longer lives a privileged life.  When she and her mother emigrate to the United States from Mexico, they find life difficult living in their tent town community.  However, Esperanza and her mother start to make a life for themselves, and the result is uplifting.  Depressing at first, it's a story loved by fifth and sixth grade girls, and it leads to some great discussions about the \"haves\" and the \"havenots\" throughout American History. ", "id": "4"}

I am from the area that the book is set in and thought it would be interesting to see another perspective on farm laborers. This book was excellent!

I would recommend it! ", "id": "4"}

Even though you can barely tell that it is read, just by the edges of the cover, the good part about this book is that is is completely flawless on the inside. Compared to this one other product I bought on eBay, it is the complete opposite! The other had pages that were yellow,the cover bent at a corner, and you can tell that it is really old.

The books are beautifully illustrated and gives adults the opportunity to spend some special time in thought and conversation with little ones.

Again, great book for ages 2 and up! ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "I remember when this movie had just come out. Since then I have moved many times and gotten married so My copy was lost. I looked everywhere but no store had this rare movie. I turned to ebay and was relieved to find it.   The story of how a littel girl from a torn family loses her mother in a car crash in New zealand. Her father comes and takes her home to Canada, where she has to learn to adjust to new friends and a new family. When she adopts a flock of orphan geese, her world and purpose begins to focas as she protects and raises them along with her father. In a journey to save her geese, and teach them the right route to take on their migration south, she forms an unbreakable bond with her father and learns even if we lose the ones we love, we are never alone.   Very inspiring. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "If you are in the market for a heart warming, family friendly flick, with some gorgeous shots and very high production values, Fly Away Home is a great bet. The acting is solid (save for Paquin), and the video and audio, while not stunning, are more than good on this Blu-ray release. The best portion of this release is easily the Ultra Geese documentary, which is an absolute must see. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I bought this one as I just gave the previous one I had to someone & wanted to replace it back into my own collection as it is one of my very favorite stories. It is a touching story of a early teenager getting to know her father from whom she had been separated for a number of years by a parental separation. The mother passed away & left the daughter somewhat bitter toward the situation. As the father (Jeff Daniels) in his rather unusually cluttered home of creative projects attempts to do his best in the only way he seems to know to reach out to his daughter they finally find something in common. This proves to be affective but so fascinating to follow as they do an unusual feat to get a flock of wild geese from the north to the south--a great distance in an outstanding way. See how & you can't help but like this movie. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This movie is so sweet and touching. The relationship between Anna Pacquin and Jeff Daniels blooms through their shared love of the orphan goslings. The journey that they all make together is spectacular and moving, completely worth the price of admission! My daughter loves this film as much as I do and she's 18...a film for all ages to be sure. A definite must-have for a comprehensive DVD library. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "One of the finest family movies I have seen. Charming and sentimental, in a good way, this film stands on the backs of the actors.  Each one, from young Anna to the old liberal college professor protestor is invested in his or her character.  The sound track was moving and the photography beautiful.  My four year old followed through and asks for it again and again. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Wow, I thought there would be more reviews on this movie seeing as how it's a wonderful one.   I saw this movie when I was younger, when it used to play on TV. It is such a wonderful film to watch with the family. Kids will love this movie, especially if they have a thing for animals. It sends a great message about growing up and taking responsibility, even when you're young. It's definitely one of those fun movies to watch on a Sunday evening. The birds will steal your heart, they are adorable to watch. This is a must see family film that will take you on a great journey! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Heartwarming, true story with absolutely beautiful photography. It's about a young girl whose mother got killed. She went to live with her dad and found some goose eggs which had been abandoned due to construction disruption,  She took the eggs home and hatched them, and the babies bonded to her. Then she and her dad had to figure out how to teach the geese to migrate. Get the movie to find out how they did that. Humorous, poignant, deals with current issues. Highly recommend. I bought a copy for myself, my son, and my daughter. ", "id": "4"}

The movie is a MUST SEE and a MUST OWN for our animal loving family.  I saw the movie years ago and bought it originally on VHS, which was eventually ruined.  So I replaced it with a DVD after being reminded of the movie when we bought some ducks.  This movie is loosely based on a true story.  The music is wonderful too. ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "I originally purchased this book to guide me in making baby food for my daughter.  The beautiful pictures and passionate advice from Annabel Karmel made this book stand out from similar cookbooks.  Not only did it instruct me how to make baby purees, but it also motivated me to make better food choices when friends and family were telling me I could introduce my baby to a little bit of ice cream, cake and other soft yet unhealthy food.  The recipes were easy to follow.  The food was easily accessible at my local grocery store.  Plus, I saved a generous amount of money following Karmel's instructions for preparing and freezing large batches of baby food!  This book was so useful to me that it has become the baby gift of choice for my friends.  When they are expecting, they ask me to give them this book at their showers!

{"review": "Pros: Nice first recipes for beginners wanting to feed their babies homemade baby foods. Easy directions, pretty easy ingredients. Colorful pictures and layout is nice. Nice tips on freezing, etc.  Cons: Ms.Karmel seems to have no regards at all to what foods should be introduced to babies first, second, third, etc. Some of her recipes have ingredients that the AAP does NOT recommend as foods for babies or at least until they reach a certain age (ie. strawberries, cow's milk, etc).   I loved these recipes even though I am somewhat a \"pro\" as far as homemade baby food goes...I've been making it for 6 years now. To make sure you are following AAP guidelines, I recommend this site, http://www.wholesomebabyfood.c​om/solids.htm , to get printable charts on what foods are okay and what should wait. ", "id": "6"}

The animals are challenging enough for older kids, too. If you have a budding artist in your family get this book. In no time kids will be able to draw spiders, birds, fish, dogs, sheep. . .and much more. I had this book when I was in first grade and still remember how to draw a frog and a lion that amaze my little ones now. ", "id": "4"}

The book uses easy to draw shapes to create cartoonish drawings of a variety of animals.  It makes it so easy to learn to draw.  You can use these sketches as a foundation to create more elaborate drawings.  It is a wonderful book that I wish I had as a child. ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "This is a wonderful book for halloween - perhaps one of the best on the market for the baby - preschool age group! 10 Trick or Treaters works on two levels - not only does it help children understand the general concept of Halloween, but it is also a counting book. We begin with 10 children all costumed and ready for a night of trick or treating, and one by one the child count decreases as a spooky character comes out and the child goes home! But just to clarify, this is not done in a scary manner - the spooky characters are all whimsical and do little more than put in an appearance! The book appeals for a number of reasons....it has a catchy rhyming verse with lots of repetition which will appeal to children and makes the text enjoyable to read. Then the illustrations are wonderful - bright, vivid and bold - the beauty of the artwork is also the fact that is is adapted to the audience - silly, unrealistic colors help make the \"monsters\" cute not scary! A great book that helps impart counting and halloween information in a fun, enjoyable manner....well worth checking out! ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "I bought this for my 6 year old daughter because she loves dogs and has Air Buddies and has seen Air Bud. It's a pretty cute movie where the pups accidentally get into an ice cream truck and land up in Alaska and end up on a dog sled team! I'd have to say there are 2 negatives to me, first is that one of the guys who leads the dogsled team is pretty mean. He doesn't care about the life of his dogs, he mocks the loss of other dogs and even purposely wipes other people out on their sled during the race! I guess every movie must have a conflict, huh? My next opinion is bias because I am a Christian. There is the one pup who's name is Bud'ha. The name gives it away. In Air Buddies there was a little bit of meditation, but it seemed like there was more in this movie. I tell my daughter that's \"yucky\". But on the flip side the little boy in Alaska who is these pups dogsled person, he says a prayer at one point for more dogs so he can have a dogsled team since he has one dog and is five dogs short.

She thought that was a stupid name for the pup and talked her son into naming it something else. About 2 months later she watched the movie Snow Buddies. She now understands where he got the name. Boy did she feel bad.    This is a fantastic movie for the whole family. We are going to buy Space Buddies and see if it is just as good. ", "id": "4"}

You may remember her from Air Buddies, when they meet the wolf face first.  She steps right out ahead of her brothers and says:  \"I am puppy, hear me roar!  Awhoooo!\"  She is the tough, protective one! This is a movie for anyone with children, animals lovers, Golden Retriever owners and lovers of that special breed.

{"review": "This book aims at presenting a historical, not an ideological, scenario surrounding the time of Jesus. It succeeds.  Like a history book, it is exceedingly well researched and referenced. Unlike many history books; however, it is a 'page-turner', reading much like a modern mystery thriller. This book is nothing less than a Classic on the history and politics of Jerusalem and Rome at the time when Christian beliefs began. Ever wonder why the Church is centered in Rome, far from the Jerusalem where Christ walked and talked? Read the book and you will understand this mystery (and much more). ", "id": "9"}

The book connects different parts of nature to the night of the child's birth. Just beautifully created.  My 6yr old loves it and it soothes my 5mon old baby when I use it as her bedtime story.  It also puts emphasis on the idea that there is no one else in this world exactly like them, making them feel as special as they are.  Nancy Tillman also has a book named \"It's time to sleep, my love\".  Similar illustations and same poetic flow make it a must-have as well. ", "id": "4"}

The last time I gave it at a shower, mom-to-be read it aloud and couldn't finish it because she became overwhelmed with emotion.  Maybe I should've waited to give it AFTER the baby was here.

{"review": "I bought this game first and foremost because I am a collector of Squaresoft/Enix/Square Enix games.  My wife and I are playing it together and we just think it's the bee’s knees! Here are the things we like about it:  GRAPHICS - way cool looking and easy on the eyes, nice vibrant color MUSIC - completely orchestrated soundtrack that's not too overbearing STORYLINE - my wife's favorite part, superb voice acting, can't wait to see what happens next CHARACTERIZATION - you get a history on everyone which adds a much needed depth to the story and allows you to make an easier emotional investment in the game overall AUTO-BATTLE FEATURE - it's fantastic that the AI can control your three comrades during battle if you so choose; this makes light work of the all too frequent random battles SIDEQUESTS - this is a great staple in a lot of rpgs, enough stuff to keep you busy for hours FREE-ROAMING WORLD MAP - for those that played Final Fantasy X and thought, \"what's this linear path crap!?\" have no fear, walk where ever your feet will take you  Here is what we found lacking:  LEVEL GRINDING - if you try to just run though the game from storyline to storyline without level grinding, you WILL get smacked down, the game difficulty is such that you are supposed to spend time leveling up your characters, this is a disturbance for those (like my wife) who just want to see what's coming up next, thank goodness for the Auto-Battle MENU SYSTEM - no matter what action we are trying to perform be it attacking an enemy, healing our companions, or trying to outfit our party with different armor, we always feel like we are forced through page after page of menus and are pushing way too many buttons to do what ever it was that we wanted to do SAVING THE GAME - why does it feel like it takes soooo damn long to save this game? oh no, you can't just go up to the priest and select save, choose a memory card, select overwrite game, and save it, you have to sit through his annoying talking (which you can't fast forward though) between each of the steps I just mentioned when saving. Is this a ploy to get you to save less time during the game? I don't know, but it needs fixing. FREEZE GLITCH - so, I was impatiently trying to speed through the 'you-must-read-this, you-can't-skip-this' text of the stupid girl who was trying to sell me herbs in Port Prospect and when it came time for me to select yes or no if I wanted the herb, the game froze. I hadn't saved in over 4 hours previous to this because of the reason stated above but also, I had no idea that the game would glitch, games aren't suppose to glitch, now I'm being beaten into submission by my conscience to suffer through the long tedious process of saving my game every five minutes in fear that it will glitch out on me again. this was the one and only time it glitched on me and I think it was a freak isolated incident, but still...  Overall the game is a winner. If you enjoy old-school RPGs like Final Fantasy IV & VI, Chrono Trigger and the like, get this game! It's very reasonably priced. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Unlike other RPG's there aren't any confusing battle menus, skill trees, or terribly horrific magic systems with a steep learning curve. It's all about straight up battle and story line. DQVIII begins with a guard, \"you\", who strangely withstands a magical attack from a demented court jester named Dhoulmagus. This jester puts a whole city into a form of \"suspension\" via vine roots, of course with the exception of, you guessed it, you. Later in the story you befriend a funny bloke Yangus and begin your journey to find out what happened.  A very typical premise.   I can only imagine the developers in their first meeting:  Boss says with hands out as though measuring a small fish: \"I got an idea, lets have a teenage hero...hear me out, a hero that saves the world from evil?...eh, ehh?\" *looks around the room for approval*.  Yes Men/Women unanimously approve with nods and whispers.  Yes man #4 says \"...and maybe we can throw in a princess, to save from said evil, sir?\"  Yes Men/Women look towards Boss for reaction.  Than Boss says after smacking his tongue against the roof of his mouth for 10 seconds, \"Yes...yes! I like your thinking Johnson!\".  Yes man #4 \"Its Thompson sir!\".  Boss \"What ever, moving on...\".   This game is easy to jump into, if you've ever played an RPG circa 1990's, you'd know all about random battles and staged events, its all there, your typical throw back RPG with a modern flair. Walk around long enough, and you'll be entered into a fight whether you like it or not. Collecting, equipping, buying, selling, talking to towns folk to further the story is simple and quick. You'll rarely find yourself lost or out of touch with current events, thanks in part to the option to chat with each and all current party members so-as to get an idea of what to do next.   The weapons, potions, magic and items are extremely straight forward. There's even a type of Alchemy pot in which you can create better items and equipment later in the game, simple, quick and just plain fun. Want to know what works best for each character before you equip something, no problem, they show it to you. One of the things that really struck me with DQVIII was the soundtrack, it was amazing! From the initial load-up menu to the in-game itself, it sounded epic. Although I'm not a huge fan of cell shading, I liked the graphics. It was crisp, clear and enjoyable to watch.   As good as the world looked, I was surprised to see that just about every towns folk looked exactly the same as the last. And whether your in Town A or some boondock village B, each and every inhabitant looked identical as the last. The monsters suffered the same fate, they were basically cookie cutters of each other, and varied slightly in looks as they get tougher. Fight a lesser brown Wyvern in one area and later it's a meaner purple one with a slightly different name, and so on. Another issue I had was with the equipment. With the exception of Jessica, no other character physically donned the armor you put on. It damaged the experience.   The voice acting was surprisingly better than most RPG's and the gameplay was plenty enough to keep me going right up til the great twist at the end. Speaking of the ending, I would have preferred a better one, instead of the lame \"animal house\" esque photo stills subtitled with their wacky future achievements (or lack of).  Over all, if you like conventional RPG's and own a PS2, this is a must buy. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "If you're the type of RPG gamer who grew up playing the original dragon warrior and final fantasy NES games, and who still thinks of them fondly, then this is the RPG for you. Designed to be more of a \"traditional RPG\" DQ8 does just about everything right. From the gorgeous graphics and detailed animations to the beautiful soundtrack and enjoyable sound effects and on to the stunning overworld and dungeon design, DQ8 is an absolute masterpiece. -Story. Recall that this is a traditional RPG, and what tends to go along with that classification is a traditional storyline. There's some great evil brewing somewhere evil and evil people are doing evil things because of it. -Characters. Characters are interesting and unique in personality and are fun to interact with. You start out with only two playable characters, but that increases to a max of four as the story progresses. And these characters are full of personality as well as different enough from one another to not seem like clones. -Voice Acting. Top-notch. Some have complained that most of the voices are British, which is definitely true, but is that really a bad thing? -Graphics. Absolutely gorgeous. If every game had graphics of this caliber, Iâ€™d buy them all.-Music and sound. Beautiful and appropriate. From the opening title theme that most old-school RPGers will recognize to the ending track, all music is fully orchestrated and a delight to hear. Granted, there aren't many tracks overall, and many of them will be played over and over again, but don't be too disappointed. Remember, even the common tracks are pleasant to the ears. -Battles. Just like the old days. Battles involve the good guys lined up on one side and the bad guys lined up on the other side, facing each other. Action is turn-based, with the player inputting commands for all the characters (fight, magic, skill, run, defend, etc) and each character's and monster's reaction statistic generally determines the order they take their turn. Battles are fast and fluid. Characters jump toward the enemy, blast them, and hop back in line. Again, lightning fast. And this is a good thing.  -Magic and skills. As you level up, you'll get skill points that you can assign to various types of skill categories such as sword, spell, sex appeal, etc. Which categories you see depend on which one of the four characters you're dealing with. Depending on where you allocate these points, the characters will learn particular skills when they level up. In short, the system works well, with the magic casting characters getting the good spells and the offensive-minded characters getting the good attach stuff. -Overworld and dungeons. One word: expansive. The world is designed to mimic a real, living place. When you travel from Town A, through the forest, across a rope bridge, through the valley, and up the hill to Town B, you actually get to do all that. It's not simply a case of pointing your character to the east, and holding down the \"run\" button until you bump into the next town. -Random encounters. -Extras and side quests. There's a reasonable amount of stuff to do once you finish the main game, including a cool battle arena where you pit monsters you've \"collected\" or tamed against ranks of computer controlled monster teams to win prizes and other cool things. Other things include hidden treasure chests, dungeons and bosses. Really, this game is long and fulfilling. This game is a gem and is an absolute masterpiece. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Dragon Quest VIII is a classic RPG in every sense. This installment really doesn't do anything new or take many risks in introducing new ideas into the RPG genre. However, what this game does do right, is refine traditional RPG action to a high degree.   You'll immediately notice that the graphics are cell-shaded and whether you love cell-shade or not, this game is beautiful. The world to explore is massive and really cannot be described without doing it injustice. Each character has a distinct, though somewhat cliche personality. Voice acting is featured during major cut-scenes and events and is also top-notch. Though you may find it funny that all of the characters have distinctly British accents.   You'll begin the game like you've begun many other RPG's - trying to undo an evil curse and set things right in the world. Where the story takes you from there you'll find out over the course of 60-120+ hours of gaming. This is a game where you can really take you time enjoying the vistas and fighting mechanics and turn your characters into true powerhouses. Or, you can quickly make your way through the game skipping sidequests and story plots.   On the topic of fighting mechanics, you'll find nothing new here. Just finely tuned and balanced turn-based combat. You'll select from tradional fighting and magic attacks to character specific abilities. One very cool feature is the ability to \"power-up\" or charge you character. In the process you sacrifice a turn, however, the rewards are ultra powerful attacks. If you manage to find the limit of the charge ability you'll find that your characters appearnce even changes!  Throughout the game you'll encounter various friends and foes each with a distinct and individual personality. The game features over 250 individual types of enemies and over 70 \"Legendary Monsters\" that you'll eventually be able to enlist into your ranks should you best them in combat.   Additionally, the game features an alchemy system for creating new useful items or equipment. You'll spend many hours scouring the land for recipies and clues for that new weapon or armor. Some items even manage to permantely change the appearance of your characters.   All in all I highly recommend this game. I did not once put this game down to play something else. If you love RPG's you'll almost certainly love this game. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "First off, if you don't know what RPG stands for (or you think it means Rocket Propelled Grenade), then you may want to start off with a more mainstream series such as the uber-popular Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts series first.  Even so, this game is well-crafted and will provide countless hours of exploration and fun for nearly any age, even with no background in the genre. In this game, you start off controlling a character known as the Hero, who is searching for a way to cure his \"cursed\" king and princess, in a small town with many people and little information.  You must find the source of the curse and eliminate it....easier said than done. The gameplay feels very non-linear, as the game subtly gives you clues to the next location you need to go to, and you must explore the world, mostly on foot.  You will need to fight monsters ALOT (go explore the world) in order to become strong enough to defeat the bosses, (which are usually HARD) and you will actually need to strategize to survive (none of that button-mashing the X button---Attack, Attack, Attack).  Some tips would be to explore a lot, talk to everyone, look in all of the cabinets for items, press Start and talk with your party members often, and don't let everyone in your party die.  It's also important to know that you can only save at a church and nowhere else.  The story is very interesting and complex (but not as emotional as a Final Fantasy), and there are quite a few good side-quests and minigames.  The music is good, a little repetitive, and the graphics are amazing, with cel-shading giving the game a Dragonball Z look, and cool-looking monsters, as well as the fantastic array of environments, especially later in the game.  The battle system is turn-based ala FFX, with many options, though it seems slower than most, but it's still great.  The voice acting is super (and mostly British), with the only problem being that it's a little slow, but it's a welcome addition.  So, to summarize: Graphics --- A (very detailed environments, great characters and artwork) Sound --- A- (soundtrack kind of repetitive, but great voice acting) Controls --- B+ (cannot customize buttons, user-controlled camera a must) Gameplay --- A+ (lots of sidequests, 2nd ending, extremely long game 50+++ hrs) Learning Curve --- B (takes a while to understand the game mechanics) Value --- A (comes with FFXII demo, and you may want to experience the story again and again)  This game has a learning curve even to RPG veterans, but is still accessible to a large range of people (not a kiddie game either).  If you're at all into RPGs, buy this, you won't regret the experience!!! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I bought this title because I was looking for a new RPG to play and this one was rated highly, seemingly by everyone.  It was one of the fastest selling Japanese PS2 titles, and it got a 89 out of 100 on Metacritic.  I'd never played a game in the DragonQuest series.  So I picked it up with high hopes... and found it absolutely horrible (while I'm 30 hours in).  But, I've figured out what my problem is: The game is designed for DragonQuest fans.  I grew up playing the Final Fantasy series.  So when FFXII hit the markets, I really enjoyed it.  What I couldn't see because nostalgia was blinding me was the fact that the near 90 HOURS of play time are largely taken up by grinding for levels, wandering, trying to find extremely rare ingredients for the highest armors and weapons, and watching a story unfold that has poor character development.  The game might be pretty, but when you get down to it, there's a lot of unnecessary annoyances about it.  Being a Final Fantasy fan, these things are easy to overlook; especially the level-grinding.  RPGers have largely gotten used to this artificially game-lengthening device.  And the effect is cumulative.  Even long-time console RPGers like me get their minds blown when they find out how much time WOW players spend grinding.  DragonQuest, then, is a game for the fans, for the kids that grew up playing the DQs that came before it.  I would list my every complaint with the game, but looking up its positive reviews I see that everything I hated, other people are loving (and many are the same flaws I just listed for FFXII which I enjoyed).  Indeed, I often hear that it's a great game for \"true\" RPG fans, or those looking for a \"traditional experience.\"  People actually like endless strings of fetch-quests, level grinding, over-priced shops, wandering for rare treasures, getting lost, an entirely linear and puerile plot, and a clunky battle system.  If this game had came out 20 years ago, it would have been remarkable for its graphics and nothing more.  Final Fantasy VII preceded this title by nearly a decade, and had a more efficient battle system, inventory set up, and certainly a more engaging storyline (with less linearity).  The problem here is that I don't have nostalgia's blinders, like I did for the Final Fantasy series.  I overlook the glaring faults of FF because over the years and HUNDREDS of hours I've spent playing them, I've gotten used to it.  In the words of Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw (the voice of Zero Punctuation) \"There's nothing inherently sacred about game designs from the olden days.  They're just old.\"  This is DQVIII's flaw.  It has marvelous appeal to the RPGers that were there at ground zero; back when games were paradoxically harder than solving a greased Rubik's cube yet designed for pre-adolescent children.  The trouble is, gaming and gamers have evolved.  Playing a new DragonQuest title is like playing a re-released pre-FFVII title with improved graphics and inserted FMV cutscenes: they're both returns to form, but the form isn't good, it's just traditional.  So for the uninitiated, DragonQuest VIII is nearly unplayable.  My first introduction to RPGs was the Final Fantasy series and I've since grown up a bit.  This title is a throwback to an even earlier time with modern enhancements, I'll give it that.  But retro is only cool per se.  After the initial euphoria of nostalgia wears off, you remember how much better we do things nowadays. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Well first let me say, \"Wow!\".  This game this is shaping up to be one of the most thrilling  games I have played in a while. Where does one begin when reviewing a game of this magnitude? Let's start of with the controls! Also let me warn you that I am in no way a pro with writing reviews and I am just a hardcore RPG player and want to share my thoughts on the game with everyone! Having played DW games since the NES days I had a fair idea as to how the controls would handle. Being the game is the first fully 3-D game and with the addition of the Cel-shading I was wondering how this game would handle. The character movement is sharp and the response time for the commands is just right. I found that the controls have a fluid feel and the menu and such is well laid out. The Menu has been redefined and it takes some getting used to but after a half hour it was like second nature  to me. Controls Rating = B+  Next up Visuals. The game looks beautiful. This is some of the best cel-shading I have ever seen in a game. The look and feel of the world is breathtaking. One of the neat features is the ability to go into first person viewing and take a look at your surroundings. I highly recommend running around the lush environment and taking peeks at all there is to see. Visual Rating = A+  Voice Acting. Superb from what I have seen so far. This is also the First Dragon Quest game to have voice acting and it is spot on. Pleasant voices seem to capture the emotion of the characters speaking. Voice Acting = A  Interest value. This game has set the stage for a mystery or two. The opening intro leaves a lot of question to be answered  and during the first mission to the waterfall cavern still much is left out in the open. After a couple hours the game still has not really explained the relationship to the other members in your party. I believe these relationships will be slowly introduced as time goes on though. Interest Value = B-  Overall rating. So far this game is an exceptional addition to the Dragon Quest series. With the beautiful visuals, brilliant voice acting, and the growing interest value I think we have a game for the ages here. I am willing to bet this will be trumpeted as one of the best games in the series. Square-Enix has put together a exceptional game and it should attract fans young and old. I highly recommend picking this game up! Bravo Square-Enix! Overall Rating for Dragon Quest 8 = A- ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is my first D.Q. game I have played so I was surprised there was no place to save before fighting a boss. I found myself leveling up even more than I usually do, which is saying something, because I level up more than I probably need to in any other RPG.  I did not want to die and loose half my money so I walked around the beautiful world fighting. A good thing the makers did was give you purpose in walking around the area you were in, because you could find chests that had (many times) useful items. So leveling up was not as labored because you wanted to see what was beyond the hill, or corner. Every section of the world was interesting to explore and the quests were fun and did not seem tedious. The story line was excellent I never thought, “why am I going here or there?’ I can see playing another D.Q. game in the future. I liked the upbeat music that generally played and the music would change appropriately for the theme. I tried not to deduct too much from the total score for having to make stuff. For instance, I never made anything for the mouse. My personal taste would be to fight, make my money and go buy the armor, shield, etc. You could, but the better items you would have needed to make. I did not even try fighting in the monsters arena until I was about 80% done. I do not do much when it comes to “on purpose extra fighting” in any RPG, so when I checked it out, I had recently bought the guide for my collection, and looked up some monsters to fight; I never wanted to go past my two sets of monsters. I could see how if I had checked out the monster arena earlier the regular fighting would have been much easier. If you want to try a DQ. game out, this would be the gem to play. In closing, I am giving the game play a 9 because of the making of the items. If I did not have the guide, I would have thought it was too convoluted to make any sense of what to make over something else. As I said earlier, I did not get the guide until I was about 75% done. Then I started making things, but before that, I just did not want to spend the time using an item that maybe I shouldn’t have for something better down the road. You definitely get your moneys worth with this game. I spent well over 100 hours on this game but if you chose to do all there was to offer you would spend so much more. I didn’t fight the dragons! It meant that I would have to make more stuff and as I said, it isn’t my favorite thing to do. Even in not doing all the things that are offered in this game, I am very much satisfied very happy I played it. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "First, I am a big fan of the entire Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest series.  Over all, it is very consistent in its gameplay and its quality.  Dragon Quest VIII, though, is likely the best of the series.  The game is a combination of the DQ team's great story telling and battle engineering and the phenomenal graphical quality of Level 5.  If you aren't familier with the name, think Professor Layton or Dark Cloud II.  The graphics are based on Japanese anime in style.  Rich colors, a 3D world, and third person behind the head view.  The story is typical classic RPG.  To make your way through the main story line, you essentially do favors in each minor location in the form af beating up local baddies.  This to me isn't a bad thing.  It's interesting and the areas are detailed and fresh.  The battle system is also a classic round-to-round system, as with the entire DQ series.  I hesitate to call it turn-based, as it technically isn't.  You make your choices as to how each of your characters will play in the next round and the game executes from there, trading off between the player characters and the monsters.  Anyway, it's a great game.  If you don't have it, get it. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "After clocking in 118 hours of game play I'm finally finished and totally bummed that it's over. Hands down this has been the best RPG I've played since Final Fantasy VII. Even better than Final Fantasy X in my opinion.  This game has a turn based battle system meaning that you have time to strategically plan and select what you want your characters to do as opposed to an active battle system where you have to think quick and everything happens in real-time. I prefer the turn based system because you can focus more on watching what's going on instead of trying to flip through menus and spell list quickly during a battle while your characters are being pummeled.   The graphics and characters are unique as they are cell shaded, and they have a sense of humor. Even the enemies and monsters can be humorous at times. Very light hearted, humorous alternative to many of the RPGs that have serious end of the world type scenarios such as FF X.  At a point you acquire an alchemy pot that allows you to combine different items, weapons, and armor to form new items which is really unique and a great features. The alchemy pot is similar to the synthesis functions in Dark Cloud 2.  There are plenty of side quests such as playing in the casinos, assembling a monster arena team, collecting mini medals, and making items for different shop keepers. Collecting and battling monsters is especially fun. You get to hunt down and recruit monsters in order to build a team and battle against other monster teams. There is plenty to do without the tasks and side quests getting too repetitive or boring.  Overall I'd give this game a 6 out of 5 if I could and I hope the sequel sticks to this formula. Highly recommended for anyone that loves traditional RPGs. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Dragon Quest VIII, as I'm sure has been stated before, is a RPG of epic proportions.  Having only played the original Dragon Warrior on the NES I was not too familiar with the series, but I've always been a fan of RPG's like the Final Fantasy's and others.  After doing a little research about the game I found many rave reviews and other forms of praise for DQVIII so I decided to give it a try.  I was hooked instantly.   I won't go into too much detail about the actual gameplay, since there are other sites that do reviews on such matters professionally, but I will say that everything comes together very, very well as a whole.  The story is somewhat generic and predictable, but is very well presented and will keep you (the player) interested throughout your 60+ hour adventure.     The art style is amazing.  I've always been a fan of Akira Toryiama's work ever since Chrono Trigger (this was the first time I was exposed to his art style since I never watched the Dragonball series on TV) on the SNES, and the characters in this game are no different.  Everything is so wonderfully detailed and animated it almost has to be seen to be believed.   The music is very well done and suits the game perfectly.  There were many times I found myself humming along with the music during a battle or when venturing out into its vast overworld.   The gameplay is traditional RPG style with random battles where your party and the enemies take turns attacking.  Each character brings with them special skills and abilities that make them unique and are useful in various situations.  As you progress you can strengthen their individual skills and learn even more powerful attacks... however the leveling up can be somewhat tedious later in the game.   Overall this is an excellent game worthy of an addition to any RPG fan's library.  Highly recommended! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The Dragon Quest series has been known to the US as Dragon Warrior and started on the Nes back in the 90s I believe. The originals are classics for turn-based RPGs and this one is no exception. This game is made by the same people who brought you the Final Fantasy series and is every bit as long and epic as well as intricate. First off, Let me say that the graphics on this game are spectacular. They use some sort of cel-shading I believe and on a HD TV it might as well be on the new systems. The gameplay mechanics resemble the earlier games in the series with the addition of the Psyche Up mode which allows player to use a turn to gather their energy to take off more damage or increase the power of a spell. You also get the option of creating a monster team to fight for you as well as in a gambling style arena. The story is good but more of a kid's story. The more but I'd like to leave something to the imagination. This game packs 70+ hours of gameplay and should be in every RPG fan's collection. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This game has everything I love. DQ8 has a detailed story, great characters, and the combat system is enjoyable. Each character has their own personality that you can relate to in some way. The artwork is cartoon-y but detailed enough to not take away from other aspects of the game. You are given choices as to how you want to level up your characters through skill points. Do you want to attack multiple enemies moderately or hit one enemy hard? Each character has a basic \"class\", so that could be a downfall or be expected. You wouldn't give the magic user an axe, but that character can still use weapons instead of magic if you choose. If you enjoy any old fashioned turn-based RPG, you will love this title. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The story of this game is top notch and the gameplay is perfect. The story starts out with an evil wizard stealing a staff from your palace and places a curse on your palace and you are the only one who survives unharmed. I know that is a vague description but I dont want to ruin too much of the story for you. The story takes off from there as you meet interesting and deep characters fighting in a good battle system and exploring a HUGE world. The battle system works alot like Dragon Warrior 7. You start off in a first person view and then you pick your actions. But the main difference from 7 is that once you pick your action you get to see your character in action making for some beautiful moves. The only real problem I have with this game is that some players may find it too difficult while I never had that problem I know some people who did. If you are looking for an RPG with old school flare with new school graphics then check out Dragon Quest 8. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Dragon Quest 8 was originally a game that players would buy in order to pass the time for when Final Fantasy XII came out. But the game is very good,much like Final Fantasy..Dragon Quest is a established gaming series with classic characters and themes all to it's own.  The gameplay is very good,it may take you a bit to get used to it..but once you do. It gets very good,another feature is that the voice acting does sound very..medieval. Or should I say British...the story is a classic one.   A kind king of a kingdom has been overthrown by a evil force,and it is your job to fight the force and defeat the evil. Along the way,party members will join you..each with their own reason.  Lastly,if this is a game you have heard about..but never got for one reason or another. Like myself,get it.

{"review": "Like most people who bought this game for the Final Fantasy XII demo that was included with it, myself included. I remember the day very clearly because I used   money from a birthday card to buy this game. It turns out Dragon Quest VIII was the best birthday present I ever had. I played the Final Fantasy Demo first, then never played it again after I started playing this game.   This game can be played on so many different levels. If you want to rush through it you can in about 50-60 hours. If you like side quests, it has those too! I spent over 100 logged hours on this game between trying to find all the best monsters for the monster arena. And fighting the series of side bosses after you beat the game. Yes I said \"Series of side bosses\" and \"After you beat the game\" neat, huh?   The side bosses are so tough that this was the first RPG to have me jumping up and down on my couch yelling \"THATS CHEATING!!!\" at the TV screen. Just when you get maxed up enough to beat one, the next cuts through you like a hot knife through butter.  The animation in this game is by Akira Toriyama (creator of the Dragon Ball Series) and looks like a cartoon graphically. The only gripe I had about the games visual spectrum is that a lot of the monsters are just colored different in different stages in the game. Some people complain that a lot of the monsters you fight look \"happy\" or \"smile\" but I find it to be comical. In fact, if you are involved deep enough in the story you will find a lot of the dialog humorous, especially Yangus.   This will be one of the last great turn based RPGs to ever be made, consider everyone is moving in new directions with battle systems.   On a side note Turn Based RPGs are the best game ever because you can easily   eat, smoke, or drink while playing them!  I will never sell or trade my copy of this game, ever. ", "id": "4"}

That said, if you're looking for well-balanced random battles, challenging but not impossible bosses (some of the early ones are a bit on the easy or hard side though), and generally good traditional RPG gameplay this is the game for you.  Dragon quest shines where its predecessors shined (gameplay and balance) and falls short where the Final Fantasy series has dominated the RPG genre (graphics and plot).

The gameplay is excellent and it has great sound. The one issue I have is it is pretty linear, but there are a few side quests that you can do.

The battle require a lot of strategy instead of leveling up and overpowering your enemy. From time to time you will feel under power to your current quest. It take times and exploration to get past certain part of the game. Eventually you will clear the quest/ challenge at hand and feeling satisfied.

First of all, be prepared for a long and challenging and sometimes frustrating experience. It is a classic RPG where the story is linear, there are dungeons and yes there are dragons. World travel is pretty impressive, the storyline is fair (with romance and tragedy, I cried at a certain touching scene) It is not for children as there are some adultish-jokes (like Puff-Puff haha) and characters being killed via a swift stabbing sans blood.    There are only four characters, the battles are standard, but each four characters have four different styles of fighting (different weapons to equip).

{"review": "the story was solid and good; it was not very complex and had me still wanting more out of it.  it takes a little while to get your full party and they each have their advantages, not too much to their character like the story.  what i enjoyed very much about this game was all the extras and side quests (the mini medals and especially the dragovian trials).  i love a game that has some really good challenges after you've beaten the game (so challenging that i spent many many more hours playing it - probably around 75 hrs total game play).  i would highly recommend this game for anyone who likes a good RPG (especailly while waiting for the next FF to come out)!

The book was actually written by Dr. Seuss's wife after his death as a tribute to his love and passion for reading to babies while in the womb.  It's adorable and heartwarming and a quick read for bedtime stories.  Great for a gift or for yourself! ", "id": "4"}

It was after confirming the payment did I realize that it was not the Dr. Suess book. However, once I realized that it was a book to be read in utero, I was excited. I loved that my daughter and son-in-law could read this book to my first grandchild now. I couldn't wait to give it to her and as soon as it arrived, I wrapped it in pretty baby paper and waited until my daughter and son-in-law arrived for dinner.

When I read the excerpt, I was completely intrigued by it.   I became determined to obtain my own copy of it. To my great surprise and delight, I found that this book was also published in Spanish. I am in the process of exposing my child to as much Spanish language material hoping for the language to stick even after he enters the school system.  Reading the book with my child is magical. It actually brought me to happy tears the first few nights of reading this book to him. We've since come up with our own version of how the song sounds, and I love listening to my toddler sing such sweet words. It is a very simple book, yet it tugs at the heart.  It's an easy to read book; my son loves the illustrations. They may seem simple based on an adult's perspective, but there are layers of interesting stuff that my toddler finds in them.   I am seriously considering looking for additional copies so that I can provide a copy to all my loved ones that have children. It's a beautiful book that speaks to the love and special bond between a mother and child. The author and illustrator did an amazing job at capturing the essence of this love. ", "id": "4"}

They give examples of instruments from each section of the orchestra, their sounds, piano and guitar, what an orchestra sounds like together, conductor, there's comedy mixed in (a puppet playing a tuba that makes car horn sound, and such).  My son will now name instruments he hears in other pieces we listen to.  You can't go wrong on this one. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This was my son's favorite baby einstein DVD, however we left it at the babysitter's house and she can't find it - so I went to ebay to replace it.  This is probably one of the better DVDs in this series, it has really cute  music and the puppets and people play the actual instruments.  It is the perfect length for his attention span as well (and gives me a chance to shower and dress!) ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I bought this DVD of Baby Einstein:  Meet the Orchestra for my great-grandchild who is now 6 months old.  I observe her carefully, and she is quite captivated by the bright colors, puppetry, motion and music. I found nothing to dislike about them.  They are very entertaining for enfants and must have been designed by a mother.  I highly recommend this product. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is another charming addition to the Baby Einstein series.  Using entertaining scenarios and plenty of the beloved Baby Einstein puppets, this series introduces young and old alike to the many different instruments that comprise an orchestra.  Baby may not fully comprehend the names of all the instruments in the beginning, but it will surely grow on him/her as he/she gets older.  The catchy music selections and vibrant colors paired with intersting scenes make this one a winner! ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "The name \"Baby Einstein\" can trick parents into believing it's okay or even good for their babies to watch it, but the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television AT ALL to children under 2 because so many studies have proven its harmful effects on children. Studies have shown that:   - for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%.  - among babies ages 8 months to 16 months, every hour spent daily watching programs such as 'Brainy Baby' or 'Baby Einstein' translated into six to eight fewer words in their vocabularies as compared with other children their age.\"  - brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping.   \"Signing Time\" (Two Little Hands Productions) DVDs is an excellent option for OCCASIONAL video viewing because communicating in sign language with your child is proven to:   - reduce frustration and tantrums  - accelerate language development  - promote parent-child bonding   Last thing for new moms - carrying newborn babies (in arms or next to body) an extra 3 hours a day resulted in 40% less crying. So carrying baby in a carrier or sling can help calm fussy babies! ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "This is one of those movies that's etched in my mind.  Grew up with these movies in the 80's and watched them again on HBO/Cinemax in the 90's.  I would say One Crazy Summer is probably in the top echelon of 80's teen comedies.  John Cusack is also in the top 5 of young actors from that period, not to mention you get the beautiful Demi Moore in an early role.  I'm a big art fan and enjoy drawing whenever I get a chance so this movie really hits that nail home with Cusack being an aspiring artist and using his drawings in short animations throughout the movie that kind of give it an edge over other 80's flicks.  I'm guessing this movie is out of print for the time being because I couldn't find it in any store.  This dvd version was perfect for me and I was able to find it here on ebay for a good price.  Great movie, lots of laughs, lots of fun, lots of magic. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Starring VERY young actors John Cusack, Demi Moore, and Bobcat Goldthwait, this 80's teen angst movie depicts the age old boy-meets-girl-boy-meets-girl'​s-neanderthal boyfriend-boy-meets-another-gi​rl against the backrdop of Nantucket in the midst of summer, with a few really quirky twists for good measure (a greedy developer tries to buy property for a kitschy restaurant, an uglier-than-heck dog and his little mistress torment the locals, and a boat regatta completes the mix)!    It's fun, it's campy, it's cheesy, and yeah, it's kinda lame on a LOT of levels, but for the most part, this movie is just good summer fun.  John Cusack and Demi Moore play off each other pretty well, and Bobcat Goldthwait throws in his screaming quasi-hysterical act, which goes pretty well with the scene where he gets stuck in a Godzilla suit and tramples a miniature city! ", "id": "4"}

I had them take turns reading it aloud, page by page, and recorded them.  At the end, they understood why I'd chosen the book. Even though they are \"big\" girls, the message that wherever they go, my love will be with them is perhaps more important than ever as they prepare to spread their wings and fly out into the world. My love will always and forever be with them, wherever they may go and no matter where I am.

The level of detail within the illustrations is such that each time you look something else, previously onnoticed, will almost jump out, with that sort of \"oh wow\" effect. The very nature of the simplicity of the words - to both write and speak - is what makes this such an almost must-have for any parent looking to develop their child's literacy and vocabulary.  It's use of simple colour and everyday items is sure to capture child's imagination, and the slightly comical nature (phrases like \"he doesn't eat the toaster\") of presenting the world outside using animals will only serve to enhance the captivation. As a \"Brit\", the only downside of this book is that it contains a number of \"Americanisms\", so it may confuse children who attempt to understand that these seemingly different words are in fact the same thing.

{"review": "If you like books that teach, entertain and make you think, this is a book for you. The Sign and the Seal is one man's journey to find answers to what he considers to be the ultimate question - \"Where is the ark of the  covenant today?\". Not thin in size or content, the book is 600 pages (515 in  the story itself). I found myself repeatedly saying, I wish I could go to the places and see the things he was writting about while following a long, old trail of what happened to the ark after it left the temple. Hancock's writing style is very conversational - it is like he was sitting in the room with you and either talking to you or thinking out loud; so it is not a college professor's first choice for style. But that is one reason why it is enjoyable. Topics it covers: Solomon's Temple, the Ark, life at during time, a wide region of Eygpt and the middle east, connections between regional and cultural beliefs, and the Knights Templar.     Good book, worth spending the time reading, at the end you will come away with thinking the phase \"Enjoyable, worthwhile and not surprising ending.\"                              Mike Moore staff writer for On The Trail magazine author (Heroes to Me, Rocky Mountain Album and Life in the Far West) well over 110 articles published nationally ", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This book is awesome.  Peorple can try criticizing this book however it makes it that much more essential reading.  This is the third Graham Hancock Book I am reading as my first Graham Hancock book I read was his collaboration with Robert Bauvel, Talisman.  I then read his work the Fingerprints of the Gods.  I am in effect working backwords thru Graham Hancocks most famous works as well as being able to witness his evolution as a writer.  You can easily see how his writing has become more and more refined however to read the Sign and the Seal you sense that you are there with Graham Hancock on the ground in a literal literary Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I am not able to put the book down.  In reading Grahams books I have gotten to know him as he has prodded me to grow and think, I have been deeply moved by his work.  This book is the modern gold standard in the search for the Judaic Lost Ark of Covenant.  You will easily and naturally benefit by reading The Sign and the Seal. ", "id": "9"}

{"review": "This is an allegory about WWII for children. The story line is simple and short and the pictures are needed to flesh out the authors intent. I can see how it would be helpful however children will not catch some of the book as it is really written for adults at some points. The author states her intent was to teach children to speak up and stand together against evil yet the story only hints at this at the end. Besides, children are not the ones to take on evil, that is the job of adults. Yes, we must teach this throughout their lives if we want them to do it as adults but I feel it should be made clear that it is the job of adults, not children. We teach children these skills slowly as they grow, so as adults they will stand for what is right - come what may. ", "id": "4"}

Hard to miss with Rudyard Kipling and Chuck Jones.  EXCELLENT color upgrade!  (Compare to the 3 part version on itunes).

{"review": "I am sorry, but if you do not like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, then you clearly support children being bitten by cobras. It is that simple.  This animated story about a pet mongoose adopted by a family in India is a classic. The story is simple: pet mongoose protects family from cobras Nag and Nagaina. But to leave the synopsis at that would be doing this story a disservice. Rikki-Tikki-Tavi hits on the topics of heroism, selflessness, and sacrifice as Rikki-Tikki defends the family from the cobras and their soon-to-hatch brood. This story is sweet, harrowing, and will leave you with a good feeling when all is said and done. And that is without even mentioning the terrific music and narration/voice acting that more than merits a viewing by one and all.  The other story on the disc, Yankee Doodle Cricket, follows the retelling of the Revolutionary War from the viewpoints of a cricket, mouse, and cat. In the interest of all honesty, I have not seen this one, but the back of the box says it is a \"playful, patriotic salute to both our nation's heritage and humor.\"  However, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is the real draw here. It is miles above what passes for children's viewing nowadays. After all, there is a reason a story originally made in 1975 has found its way to DVD all these years later. ", "id": "4"}

When the DVD came, my son popped it in the player and watched it about 10 times. It's one of those cartoons that  everyone in the family enjoys watching. Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is a young mongoose, who befriends a young family after they nursed him back to health. Ricki uses the principles his mother taught him, his lightning fast moves, and quick wit to stay alert, as he protects the family and other animals from the vicious snakes in the garden. But Nag and Nagaina the male cobra and his wife has a sinister plan in store for the family, and Ricky, too! As Darzee the tailor bird sings, \"Who has delivered us who?\" That adorable, lightning fast, beloved mongoose - THAT'S WHO! Short and sweet but highly recommended. ", "id": "4"}

Gerald is an awkward giraffe, but when he hears the right music, he discovers he can dance as well as the other animals.  The book is written in verse that is simple and rhythmic. The illustrations by Parker-Rees are extraordinary! My favorite page shows lions dancing the tango. And there's a secret to the book that you might not notice. Perhaps I shouldn't give it away, but each set of pages contains four tiny little characters hidden among the leaves and flowers: a cricket, a blue bug with a long nose, and a pair of one yellow and one red beetles. Try to find them. It's not easy! The cricket becomes an important character towards the end of the book.   This book will be enjoyed again and again; you'll enjoy the illustrations and your little listener will enjoy searching for the little bugs. ", "id": "4"}

I loved the book so much, I bought another on E-Bay to keep at my house to read to children visiting.  It has fantastic illustrations with lots of different animals.  It's the kind of story any child will love, boy or girl. ", "id": "4"}

I usually use the book in conjunction with an activity, and most of the time it is for k-1 students. The book is easy to understand, has some good reference points for younger students, and it is easy to check for understanding along the way.   Most of the time I end up reading it twice because the students love the voices I create for the animals.:)  Recommend. ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "It's a short book and what I expected for the value, it was appropriately priced.  The book is probably best for ages 4-7.  The illustrations are beautiful and colorful.  My children loved looking at the pictures and talking about what they saw.  It was especially effective to read the book out loud to them.  In the beginning, being exaggerated for when the child was angry and then as the story continues, becoming more calmer and quieter to show my children how sometimes when you're angry, it's better to step away and cool off.  I think the book played well for that lesson. ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "I've adopted two children and both are of a different race than myself. They are 3 1/2 and I felt it was time to start bringing up the topic of adoption and what it means.   This book is very simple and sweet and they both connected to the story very quickly.   Choco is a little bird all alone and decides to find his mother. Every animal he goes up to he searches for a similar character to one he has and asks that animal \"Are you my mother\" After being told no by several animals, Choco is very upset and doesn't even ask the bear in front of him that question whle he sits and cries.   The bear comes up and wants to hear why Choco is crying. After learning his story, she asks him lovingly \"If you had a Mama, what would she do for you right now?\" Choco goes on to tell the Bear what he needs and she acts out every deed just as he explains it.   She invites him home to have some pie and meet her other children, who are an Alligator, Pig and Hippo.   Choco realizes, that everything he needs is there for him and it doesn't look like what he thought it was supposed to.   My daughter (from China) said the first time \"But they don't match\" I looked her in the eyes and said \"Do you and I look exactly alike? My hair is red and yours is black; my eyes are blue and yours are brown\"; She acknowledged this as true. I went on, \"but you and I love each other very much and you are my daughter forever and ever and I will always be your Mommy, right?\" She shook her head yes and seemed happy.   My son's reaction at the very same time, \"They don't need to match they are a family\".   This brought a topic to the forefront I had been hesitant to bring up. They both seemed satisfied and we now have a great story to referance when it comes up again in the future; and it will.   A great starter book to teach kids people all look different, but it is what we get from the inside that matters and where we all look very much alike.   I definitely recommend this for the adopted child, particularly if you've adopted inter-racially. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is by far the best \"adoption\" book I've read, I love it.  It's simple, cute, and gets a very big point across that it doesn't matter how different our family might look but that we are all family and love is what matters.  It's appropriate for any age child.  I could read this to a baby all the way up to my 7 year old. I think this is a must have book for every adoptive family!!  God Bless! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I bought this book when my first daughter was born in March 2000 and I used it religiously.  I call it my baby food bible.  Anything and everything that I needed and wanted to know about mt baby's nutrition was available to me!  I felt empowered in knowing that I could feed my daughters (I also reference it when my second daughter was born in 2003) and that they were getting the nourishment necessary to allow them to grow and prosper.  As I write this, my daughters eat just about anything I put on their plates and are never afraid to try new and interesting dishes because I always gave and still give them a variety of foods and this book provided the foundation to make it all possible.  My children are healthy, vibrant and very intelligent (if I do say so myself).  Their drink of choice is WATER! I believe their nutrition has played a vital role in this and I cannot put into words what that has meant for me.  Having this book made it easy for me to tackle such a monumental task and it was the only resource out there at the time that was all inclusive and comprehensive.  I did not take my children's nutrition lightly by any means and SUPER BABY FOOD gave me all the information I needed and much more.  Even though I don't reference it as much as I used to I will always keep it in my bookshelf just because of the extensive knowledge it's given me.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for the right start to their child's nutrition and future, especially at such a critical point in time with the increase of childhood obescity plaguing this country!!!!!

{"review": "This book is excellent for those who are looking to make their own baby food. She stresses the importance, but also gives way to practicality, indicating it does not have to be an all or nothing approach. Do what you can! But for those who are very into making their own food for toddlers, infants, and themselves alike, this book has so many useful recipes, so much useful information.  The downsides...the recipes often do not have ingredient listings, so you must read through the recipe to find out what is in it. Not all are like that, but enought that I took note. It is very big, packed with info, so it is hard to travel with. All in all, I LOVE IT! I would recommend this book to anyone who is a parent to any age child. Enjoy! ", "id": "10"}
{"review": "I first bought this book for recipes for food I could make for my 6 month old daughter, thinking it was just a cookbook.  This book goes into great detail about nutrition in general.  Although it does seem too extreme at times (by insisting everything is organic and homemade for your baby), it is a great measure to compare yourself and your child's eating habits.  It presents menus and foods in several different formats, making it a quick reference guide as well.  I don't follow every suggestion in the book, and have adapted some of my own techniques to preparing food.  After reading this book, I am grateful that I am now confident feeding my baby without always having to resort to jarred baby food. ", "id": "10"}

Fabulous purchase from a wonderful seller! Thank you so much! :) ", "id": "10"}

Overall a great resource book.  Like I said, I don't follow it completely but common sense takes over where ever Ruth Yaron leaves off, and she gives the tools needed for me to feel comfortable to \"do my own thing\" with baby.

{"review": "I love this book and keep it with me even when we travel.  Once I began reading labels for baby food past stage 1, I realized that the only way to keep healthy foods for my child would be to make food myself.  This book gives me very clear guidelines, good instructions and suggestions.  I use it every time I make food, for my child or myself, and also as a reference for several friends who are unsure of what to give their child, when and how.    It also allows you to broaden the food that your child eats.  For example, my child's first food was an avacado which is better than a banana in many ways, but you can't find that in a jar!  This book encourages me to make healthy foods for my child by providing suggestions, multiple recipes, and very good and well presented information.  I am amazed at how easy it is and wonder why more people aren't doing it.  Even my mother in law is impressed with the food I make! ", "id": "10"}

In addition to all of this great stuff, there is a full section on tricks in baking and great activities for kids and families.  She also has a lot of details in the book on how she shops to save money and make the most of her family's food dollar.  I've used my book to the point that it is covered in water splashes & food spills and the cover is bent and folded.  It is one of the 3 books I can't live without in the kitchen.

{"review": "Pros: This book came recommended by my pediatrician and many good friends.  It is a great comprehensive guide to making baby food.  It has wonderful, concise information on what foods to feed babies, when to feed them and how to make them.  It also has a wealth of good ideas for thrifty moms like myself.    Cons: The information on when to introduce nuts contradicts the American Association of Pediatrics and can be confusing.  It also does not include much information regarding the introductions of meat (I am guessing the author is vegetarian?) ", "id": "10"}

There is good information in this book, but it is poorly organized, and buried in a lot of eccentric verbiage.  Plus, the author has a lot of bizaare beliefs - that there are 22 amino acids (which will surprise a lot of molecular biologists), and that you should stand away from blenders because of EMF radiation. It's harder to take the author seriously when she espouses some quack beliefs. And harder when she doesn't realize that working parents don't have the time to wade through her idiosyncratic ramblings to get to the information we need (how much should I feed, what foods should I mix with each other, etc).  Frustrated, I bought the Fresh Baby Kit, which, though more expensive, presented the information needed in a short cookbook + 1 card (!). ", "id": "10"}

What I like in the book is the list of vegetables and fruits (at the end of the book) with all information a parent might need. I also like some of the recipes (the ones I tried thus far). And I like Ruth Yaron's style. She is a good writer. What I miss from the book is objectivity and meat. The writer is a vegetarian, you can tell. She recommends to introduce tofu first and meat thereafter, which is fine if you use your common sense when it comes to your kid. And she is a parent of 3 or 4 kids. So she has experience and routine, which she eagerly shares. Plus she must have read a whole lot for compiling the book. Still I am not sure if each of her word is based on research.

{"review": "Malcolm Gladwell's Tipping Point considers the elements needed to make a particular movement gain mass appeal.  The title concept, \"tipping point,\" occurs when something that began small- a few funky kids in New York's East Village wearing Hush Puppies- turns into something very large- millions of Hush  Puppies are sold.  According to the author, the success of advancing any idea depends on three rules: the Law of the Few, the Stickiness Factor, and the Power of Context.   Gladwell offers a theory of social dynamics that he contends will provoke a mass behavioral change.  He offers numerous anecdotes to make his point: Paul Revere's ride, the creation of the children's TV program Sesame Street, and the influence of subway shooter Bernie Goetz.  After analyzing a number of fascinating psychological studies, he propses that tipping points occur when subtle alterations in the environment, such as the eradication of graffiti, are enacted by a small number of people who act as connectors, mavens, and salesmen.  As he applies his strikingly counter-intuitive hypotheses to everything from the \"stickiness,\" or popularity, of certain children's television programs to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, Gladwell reveals that our cherished belief in the autonomy of the self is based, in  great part, on wishful thinking.  Tipping Point has the feel of a cut-and-paste narrative- which is probably attributable to Gladwell's journalistic background- and is definitely not the stuff of deep academic research, or sociological thought.  It is, however, an entertaining read that I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND and should affirm what we already knew, if we were honest with ourselves. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Loaded with statistics, Gladwell presents numbers in a way that makes the book read like an exciting novel. Gladwell also gives several examples in history, where one small change in behavior created a bigger change on a national level. He also studies the type of person or group that it takes to make that change. Very quick read and captivating, this is a great book. ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "Christopher Paul Curtis has proven himself as a master of adolescent historical fiction.  His writing is funny, his language understandable while meaningful, and his themes universal.  The Watson family is on its way to Birmingham, and Mr. Watson has purchased an Ultra-Glide (dashboard record player) for the ride.  The ride is full of funny moments, including believable family dynamics.  Unfortunately for the Watsons, driving from Flint, Michigan down to Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 is a dangerous ride.  The family is African-American and has to be wary of whites living in the segregated South.  Tragedy strikes because of hatred and racism, and the Watson boys try to understand as best they can.  The book brings a very real incident to life, and it makes it very real for many kids.  I've never met a kid who couldn't identify with the characters in the book, and they all love it.  It's great for fourth through seventh grade, and I got a great kick out of it as an adult.  A new classic, and a must for any adolescent's library. ", "id": "4"}

This book is nothing less than a Classic on the history and politics of Jerusalem and Rome at the time when Christian beliefs began.

Those who refer to themselves as \"Liberal\" in thought and belief will be shocked by the revelations presented. Those who consider themselves to be a \"Conservative\" will be embarrassed, among other things. I doubt anyone who reads this will end the book satisfied either with their present position, or with that of those they thought they opposed.  I once heard a biblical scholar say to those trying to argue with him over \"his\" Biblical beliefs, \"I'm just the reporter. If you want to argue, argue with the Author!\" In THE 5000 YEAR LEAP, Mr. Skousen reports the truth, the facts about the founding of this country and the reasoning behind the ideas and ideals presented in the Constitution of the United States of America. In his way, he forces us to turn from our own, selfish opinions (the ones we all use to fight one another over how to understand the Constitution) and direct our argument toward the authors. These men who, when we compare their fears and concerns for this nation's survival, appear to have been quite prophetic.  If you, regardless of label, are really searching for a deeper, clearer and even frightening understanding of where the Founders had hoped we would go and where we actually are, TODAY, you must read this book!

{"review": "What do you really know about the Constitution, probably like me not a lot?  Sure I know about the 10 Amendments but WHY did they make those and why did they do the things they did.  These were ordinary men who came together with different views and ideas but somehow in a single moment in time brought the world forward 5000 years...how did they do that?  This book tells you the values, fears and thoughts they had as they took this new government system very very seriously trying to avoid all the pitfalls of governments before.  Overtime we have lost track of those values and have flipped out country upside down.  They wanted government to begin in the family and work its way up, not to have Congress hand us goodies as they see fit.  They wanted religion, any religion, to be pursued to keep the normal man having good values that kept him from  doing evil.  They wanted only top moral, experience men to serve in office AND that these people only serve a short time and then let others serve.  They wanted to avoid the possibility of a king because man often becomes complacent and drifts towards letting others do it rather than take responsibility.   This book is easy reading but extremely enlightening.  What a wakeup call ...our country is in serious troubles and all the hard work and good intentions of the founding fathers, especially their fears, are coming to pass.  Read this book, think about it and do something.  As an American it is our duty to keep America as the Constitution requires.  Read and see why.

He points out that when the colonists landed on these shores, they used arts and crafts not very different from those which had been in use in agriculture, manufacturing and governing not very different from those used in the \"advanced cultures\" of their day some 5,000 years previously and attributes that leap to the system established which rewarded individual effort and innovation.  The Founders were able to do this by studying and capitalizing on the thoughts and philosophies of the best preceding centuries.  This serves as a warning for those who would, without sufficient understanding, throw over the system established by the Constitution.

I will warn you right away-buy this is hardcover because it will get worn out from being read over and over. In a perfect world I would buy a hardcover shelf copy for reading with a grown-up and a kid friendly soft cover copy that can get demolished from small hands at play.  Janell Cannon wrote AND illustrated this book and she has a flair for painting animal characters in awkward situations and she has mastered the knack of getting facial expressions to tell a multitude of emotions.    A hungry owl out hunting tries to catch a Mother Bat. In the scuffle the baby bat that the mother was carrying falls into a bird nest. LOST! The Mother Bird adds the baby as one of her own chick teaching the new family member all the rules of being a bird. Every kid will delight as this scruffy baby bat named Stellaluna tries to do bird things to fit in with her new family. Kids will wriggle with delight as Stellaluna learns to eat bugs instead of fruit and to not to hang upside down or fly during the night. In the end the Stellaluna is reunited with her mother and the world is made right again. The art is captivating and adds to the storyline. This story is sure to be a family favorite.  If you are buying for a gift it is worth every penny for a new hardcover. This is a perfect gift for grade school teachers to add to classroom collections or if you are a teacher this book is loved from age 3-8. This is a great pick for boys learning to read, perfect for school donations, and a great lap-sitting book for both boys and girls.   RICH CHICKS specializes in media that is purchased by women.

However, my 3 year old son (a typically active 150% boy) also found this book absolutely engrossing and enthralling so I knew I had to buy it.  The story is about a baby bat that falls into a bird nest and is brought up by the mother bird amongst her own chicks.  He learns to eat bugs instead of fruit, perch and not hang upside down and fly during the day.  In addition to the amusing story the illustrations are wonderful (beautifully crafted artwork and light years away from the naïve art so popular in children’s literature today).  It is the sort of book which parents can enjoy reading which means (of course) that it is more enjoyable for the children.

On a deeper level, the story is about fitting in/being different – it doesn’t lose a light touch though. ", "id": "4"}

I can officially say that after a month of reading this book to him while he sat and sat and sat.. that he's finally potty trained:) He requests this book when we sit, among a few others (ie: even firefighters use the potty or \"it hurts to go\".   He loved the lift a flap on this one, we talked in depth about each page, he was so interested!! I highly recommend this to parents who have a toddler who is afraid to use the potty, it helps him get his mind off of the fear of going, especially if you talk about each page, love this book!!

{"review": "I bought this book for a project working with children in foster care.  It's an interesting book and gives insight to the world of a foster child and how difficult hopping from home to home can be and the different life styles of each home.  This little girl overcame all the odds and obstacles to become a successful woman. ", "id": "28"}
{"review": "This young lady had been through a lot within the system.  The CPS system.  I am social work major so it really plucked heart strings.  I was crying after the first chapter.  It opens your eyes and lets someone see things through a child's eyes.  I told my mom about the book, bought it for her bday, and she read it in 3 days.  My mom couldn't put it down.  She said it is one of the best books ever.  The book also gives a highlight on CASA workers.  If you don't know what CASA is look it up.  Court Appointed Special Advocates.  The lies this 5 yr old was told is unreal, cruel, and apparently they had her best intrest at heart?  This is a failure of a system to help children, not break them.  This is an eye opening book.  A must read.  I met this young lady and had my copy signed.  It will remain in my library not only for myself, but for any future clients I may have. ", "id": "28"}

{"review": "Richard Scarry shares a community of fun families with us to explain lots of jobs and how things all work together.  Everything from writing a letter to Grandma to find how the mail works to building a new house is shown. Easily adapted to grow with a child- just reading the story or checking out the great illustrations with names.  You'll love this book. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "My husband has a copy of this book from his childhood.  He loved it as a child and it was passed down to our 3 year old son, who is real inquisitive about how things work.  Our son has learned so much from this fabulous book:  how to build a house, growing food on a farm, what riding on a ship is like, how firemen put out fires, what a train trip is like, how wood is used/made into boards, how electricity works, building a new road, how bread and clothes are made...  Of course it's in a kid's style with lots of funny pictures - the Richard Scarry way.  We let this book entertain our son while he needs to be quiet and still in doctor's waiting room or when we need a really good quiet activity for him to do.  It's best when an adult reads it to him and a wonderful bonding time together.  We save this book for times just as these - not just a reading book he can pull off the bookshelt.  This keeps it a special book/treat.  One thing we suggest and so do pediatricians is that TV not be watched by children because that hurts their concentration ability and may cause ADD.  We do not have a TV in the house and are so grateful for all the benefits that gives to us as parents and to our children.  We do this because TV has a lot of wicked things on it and we love Jesus Christ and do not want wicked things/influences in our house. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This book is fantastic!  I remembered it from my own childhood, and now bought it for my family.  Its illustrations highlight many businesses and professions in a way that children can begin to get an understanding of the way many people work within a community to make it run.  The illustrations are classic Richard Scarry, and the humor and warmth throughout appeal to both child and parent. Get this book and cuddle up with your little one!  My kids always want to make bread after the read the last page!  This book can be read straight through (although that might be a little long for some smaller children), or just pick and choose according to interest or time.  Either way, invest in this timeless book; you won't regret it! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This book was a recommended book for a preschoolers. And we can see why! The pictures are classic Richard Scarry. Each \"story\" is about a different job/service; postal service, building a house, building a road etc. My three and a half year old loves it. We've had it for about three months now and he asks to read it every couple days. We liked it so much we purchased it for a friend's birthday. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I had one of these when I was a kid, and I loved it! I took that book everywhere I went and now, I bought another for my niece so that she can do the same! This is the kind of book that's hard to find these days. Excellent illustrations, simple writing for the kids, nothing commercial, just that good old feeling of paging through life! The only less positive point here is that this is not the original edition, it's a shorter one so some histories are missing but still a great book to share with everyone! Specially kids of course who are always full of stupid violent TV cartoons and games... This is a good start for a change in that ;) ", "id": "4"}

The book connects different parts of nature to the night of the child's birth. Just beautifully created.  My 6yr old loves it and it soothes my 5mon old baby when I use it as her bedtime story.  It also puts emphasis on the idea that there is no one else in this world exactly like them, making them feel as special as they are.  Nancy Tillman also has a book named \"It's time to sleep, my love\".  Similar illustations and same poetic flow make it a must-have as well. ", "id": "4"}

I prefer the larger pictures as they appear in the regular hardcover version but for little ones, this board book is a much more durable version.  I actually bought a second, full size copy for my 21 year old daughter.  At first she wasn't interested but as I read it to her, I watched her expression change from annoyance to wonder.  I know she has read it several times since and I believe that when she has children of her own, she will be certain they know this book as well.  I believe she will always remember the first time she heard it and how it surprised and delighted her. ", "id": "4"}

It's so well written and the illustrations are wonderful.  My son is 2.5 and enjoys me reading it to him.  The last time I gave it at a shower, mom-to-be read it aloud and couldn't finish it because she became overwhelmed with emotion.  Maybe I should've waited to give it AFTER the baby was here.  Either way, it would still stir the emotion that only a mom can understand.  Truly a beautiful book! ", "id": "4"}

When I read it to him I could see that it had his attention, which is great for a kid who only finds fast-paced action attention-worthy.

My brother was interested because he thought the book was talking about him on the night he was born. Of course, that was the intention. I found it to be a good book, but be careful: too much talk about how special you are can lead to some conceited thoughts... ", "id": "4"}

{"review": "Kristen walks you through a 21 day partial fast.  The goal is to get closer to God through prayer and fasting.  By depriving yourself the normal luxuries of the typical American Diet which is like a king's diet, you have opportunity to feel a loss in which you are driven to seek the Lord in prayer.  You eat vegetables, fruits, legumes & nuts.  Her website give much support, devotions, encouragements, lists of foods you can and can't eat (guideline), and recipes. www.theultimatedanielfast.com   This is -not a legalistic fast, nor is it a way to loose weight, and I strongly encourage you to not look at the scale during the fast at all or you may get the wrong focus.  It is simply copying the \"idea\" of what Daniel did in one of his fasts by simply not eating the kings food but the plain food (pulse) so as to honor God with his body.  After this fast I have found a big difference in my life. I am brought to a calmness, awareness, sort of drawn away from the world's distraction and fast pace life and to a place of peace and a much closer relationship with the Lord.  I opted to continue to eat these healthy foods, not processed, for optimal health so as to keep my body in great working order to better serve the Lord.  Thank you Kristen for a great start on fasting experience.  I'm ready to now go deeper in my fasting and prayer relationship with God.   Highly recommended to get one started in fasting and eating a diet for a healthy body to therefore honor God by caring for His temple. ", "id": "6"}

{"review": "Our all-time favorite Disney classic. Sleeping Beauty is a MUST-HAVE in your DVD/Blu-Ray collection. Classic story with animation that stands as ART. From the scenes of an enchanting forest, to the fabulous castle walls; Disney's crew didn't stop at just making beautiful and fierce characters, the movie is all around eye candy. Whimsical music with Princess power ballads, it also invites the viewers into a glimpse of Disney's most cryptic She-Devil, Maleficent! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "SLEEPING BEAUTY BLU-RAY/DVD SET is a true gem to own! ONE OF DISNEY'S BEST! HIGH DEF PICTURE & SOUND AS NEVER BEFORE! The Bonus Features add so much for a history of how this MASTERPIECE was created. Many hours of viewing enjoyment for young & young in heart. I am so happy to have purchased it. My kids love it too! ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "While I am a fan of Disney's earlier works, espically Snow White, Pinnocio, Cinderella, Bambi just to name a few, Sleeping Beauty was Disney's last all hand drawn movie and I feel it is a wonderful blu ray venture for the Disney collector. If this is what we will get with the future Disney blu ray releases, collectors can expect their dreams to come true. The transfer is breathtaking in clarity, many times almost three dimensional.  The sound is wonderful, so much of Disney's genius was in the music wove into the story. The extras on the discs are so numerous it will take you hours to go through them. One that stands out is an Oscar winning short film on the grand canyon, almost a half hour long, it is amazing in high definition.  This is well worth adding to your blu ray library. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "\"Sleeping Beauty\" is a classic of American animation, though I appreciate it more as an artistic achievement than as an entertainment piece (I wasn't a fan of it as a kid). The film was always designed to look and sound spectacular, and now on Blu-Ray this is more true than ever.  A full HD restoration to the film's original 2.55:1 negative aspect ratio, 7.1 surround sound, and more special features than I'll ever get through in one weekend all make for a great purchase. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I couldn't imagine the picture in High Definition getting much better than the DVD release, but every Disney Blu Ray disc I have seen look vastly better than the DVD counterpart.  I'm sure that the player and TV make a difference, but the amount of improvement over the DVD is immense and I am sure will be noticeable on just about any HD setup.  The difference between the DVD and the Blu Ray on EVERY Disney title I have seen is as different as the DVD was from the VHS versions.  Sleeping Beauty seemed even more impressive because of the amazing colors and color shades in this film.  You can see texture and detail that just isn't on the DVD versions of their movies.  I hate to have to buy a third format of my favorite Disney films, but these really are worth it. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Well, I have the remastered dvd but the blu-ray version is clearer and the colors are more intense. In my opinion this is the greatest Disney animated full feature ever made, with Snow White right behind it! This movie took almost a decade to make and the scenery and medieval artifacts are authentic in detail. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I love the color quality and way this blu-ray is higher in resolution. I own the dvd copy of this and there is a night and day difference. The only thing I wish they did would be to add the digital copy to this but since I already have the dvd that doesn't bother me much. This is a must have for people who love the Disney classics and that are building their blu-ray movie library. ", "id": "4"}
{"review": "For all of us spanish speaking followers of Disney, it has become a hard task to find spanish audio and subs in the Sleeping Beauty BD release.   US versions do not carry spanish at all, the mexican edition is out of the counter -rejected by the public for not bringing the original spanish ost- and in Argentina, the case offering them is flawed, and the movie disc inside is the exact american one, only the extras bd carrying the spanish subs.   The only edition carrying the audio and subs in spanish happens to be the canadian version, and in fact, it does have those. It can be identified by a green small circle with a tiny white leaf inside, at the back of the case and in every disc, and some tiny lettering at the back that claims the version was made in/for Canada.   There is also the european version in Spain, but it is coded zone B. There was never an original castillian version for the movie, they always had the latin version in europe, but not sure if they made a castillian soundtrack for the 2008 release.   The 2008 spanish audio version is not bad for choruses and narration but, for all of us having memories of the original track with the glorious song in the woods and mean Maleficient's unforgettable character, as ell as the kind fairies, well, it is true, the new one can be trash.   ALL the rest, extras and picture quality included, is simply oustanding and a pleasure to watch from A to Z.  Hope we can see the original mexican spanish soundtrack put in a new release soon.

The packaging is on par with standard Disney releases of expanded editions, but superior in the sense that the Blu-Ray is slimmer, making the packaging appear more durable.  The picture and sound are tremendous...the best I've seen on Disney DVD.  It helps to have a good system though, so your mileage may vary.

Great picture and very good sound (considering that it was tweaked from audio tracks were 50 years old) and an amazing 2nd disc that's chock full of Sleeping Beauty-related images, videos, games and more.

{"review": "Spoiler alert!  This is a unique review.  The 2 disc set of \"Sleeping Beauty\" in Blu-Ray form is a marvelous video update from Disney.  The particular package which I received contained a blemish on Disc 2 (probably caused in manufacturing) which should have cause the original owner to return the set for replacement.  I have tried the disc in 3 different Blu-Ray players (Samsung, SONY, and RCA) and none would even recognize it as a valid disc.  I suspect that the seller was not even aware of the problem.  Now the unique good news.  The material on Disc #2 mostly repeated content from the earlier 2-disc DVD edition that I already owned, and reports indicate that much of it was not actually HD.  My exclusive interest was in Disc #1, not for the feature (which is probably wonderful), but for the Academy Award winning \"Grand Canyon\"!  On the earlier release, this full scope Tru-Life Adventure was not even enhanced, so the final resolution was nothing to brag about.  The content on THIS SET is digitally clean-up, enhanced, and full 1080!  Since the original footage was only 16mm this is probably as good as it's going to get!  And let me assure you if you haven't seen it that it deserves the OSCAR it won!  I would have paid the asking price for this set just to get these 30-minutes.  So let me sincerely thank you for it.

It has won numerous awards: three Emmy's, a Hugo, a Peabody --- and was the most watched PBS special on TV for about 10 years.   The DVD set offers all 13 episodes with music and  visuals, that takes the viewer on a journey of space and time. Each episode is fresh and readily understandable. Completely packed with historical re-enactments, facts and theories complete with on location commentaries, the series helps contextualize science and people who made the great discoveries. Some of it ( quite honestly) is kind of dated, but most of the core science facts really hasn't changed. I must admitt the \"spaceship of imagination\" is kind of a bit corny though.  I still remember seeing Carl Sagan on TV in the early 1980's. His unique vision to make science understandable and exciting, is still with me today. And again in 1993, when I met him after a lecture that he gave, I had brief conversation (yes I was floating). He was a professor with an extraordinary gift for teaching and inspiration. Eloquent,entertaining, informative,charismatic and intelligent.Although many have painted a darker side of this gifted man since his death, I still think he was a natural communicator,brilliant writer as well as a tremendous astronomer.   Carl Sagan, both in DVD or in book, had the ability to mix history and science through different locations in the world. He had the ability to capture the brilliant beauty that surrounds us. This series could definately be the best general science series ever broadcast on TV.An if the episodes seem a bit took long, well there is always scene selection ! ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\" is nothing short of wonderful.  If you have not already read the book, I highly recommend it.  It covers the same material as the DVD's, but in a different manner.  As for the DVD's, they are based upon Carl Sagan's television series of the same name, but with a number of updates added since the shows were first aired.  Carl Sagan has a unique and brilliant way of breaking down some of the most complex concepts of science in a way that is understandable even to children.  He also has a sincere fondness for all areas of science and the history of scientific study, and it is this enthusiasm and wonder that most impress and enlighten.  His enthusiasm is contagious and you will find yourself glued to the screen as Mr. Sagan unlocks the wonders of the universe for you.  Though the Cosmos series (and book) is most well known for its exploration of space and astronomy, it also delves into the wonders of the human body, our planet, and the scientists of our distant past as it traces the evolution of scientific understanding down through the ages.  It is a shame that Mr. Sagan has since passed away, but we can take solace in the knowledge that his contributions will live on, enlightening generations to come.  The DVD's, though somewhat dated in their level of special effects and general presentation, are highly recommended for both adults and children.  There is no objectionable material that I can think of, but there is a great deal of knowledge and wonder to be gained.  My wife and I both have science degrees, but we still found much to learn and enjoy with repeated viewings.  These DVD's will bring hours upon hours of enjoyment for the whole family.  **On an interesting side note, see if you don't agree that Mr. Sagan's voice was the inspiration for the Agent Smith character in \"The Matrix\" films.  Hugo Weaving (the actor who played Agent Smith) certainly seems to be channeling Carl Sagan in his voice inflection and mannerisms...it's almost uncanny! ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "The Cosmos series by Carl Sagan is wonderful to say the least. A scientist and humanitarian, Carl takes you on a cosmic journey through time and space revealing the mysteries of the cosmos in terms anyone can understand. The filming is good quality and the scripted segments are genuine, sometimes you can see Sagan moving his eyes while reading the cue cards. This only adds character to a man who wanted to open up science to everyone, not just men with white coats in laboratories. He wanted to open up the imagination of space beyond the science fiction movies, and he draws from our past to tie it all together. Even though it was made over 30 years ago, the information is general and relevant enough today to still hold a large educational value (there are updated segments at the end of every episode that were done only 15 years ago). Sit back and let his unique voice and authentic delivery invoke a new love for science and spark your interest to look toward the stars. If I'm ever restless, I'll put one of these discs on as a bedtime story, soothes my mind every time. Thank you Carl Sagan. ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "I was always fascinated by the documentaries created by public television after my experience with Cosmos, Carl Sagans gift to humanity. Beautifully weaving human knowledge into a 13 part series. He covers the entire landscape of understanding in some way; History, Biology, Genetics, Neuroscience, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, Religion and the relationships of all these with human politics throughout history and across cultures. It is quite a goal to hit and it is done masterfully.   Who are, of where we come and toward where we can continue. The presented Cosmic calendar, from the beginning of the formation of the earth with the Big-Bang, until the last seconds in that we are formed the human and their nature.  Old but not outdated. If you are open minded enough to look at the bigger picture of the world, this will be among the best things you will ever watch. This man was truly gifted at communicating science.  I think Carl Sagan proves how far can you go with your thought steady and slow  Highiest possible recommendation. John (Malta) ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "Carl Sagan's \"Cosmos\", originally released in 1989, is now well over 20-year-old material, and astronomy has moved on a long way since the eighties.  Based on the television series of the same name, Cosmos' scope and focus is good, although the graphics are now unfortunately dated. Thus the series can best be recommended as a sort of historical astronomy primer: it is definitely not cutting edge. Sagan does have a captivating way of presenting the complex concepts of astronomy, and his enthusiasm is contagious. That's the best part. He got a lot of folks interested in science rather than skateboards.  Now, I know I'm in the minority, but, on the other hand, I find the heavy mixture of his religious ideas into the material annoying. The repetitive \"We have all evolved from goo yet are now on our way to becoming gods who control the universe!\" paradigm is hidden religious content presented without the presence of any contrary position. Such assumptions as alien evolution, human space & time travel, and 'what-if' human evolution are other wild leaps that I have difficulty stomaching in what is billed as educational/scientific material. Such speculation is actually new-age propaganda that's being transmitted under the radar.  So far, there just isn't any science behind these ideas, just the assumption that since we're here, we must be evolving into gods!   Let's just stick to the facts of science for now: When science can explain why Polonium-218 halos exist in granite, why no supernovas have yet sterilized earth, why both the helium and carbon-14 contents of the atmosphere are still increasing, why the director of the largest fossil collection in the world says he is not aware of ANY transitional fossils, why the salt content of the oceans is so low despite the continual yearly increase, why human DNA continues to rapidly unravel at the ends (at a rate that will kill us after 100,000 years, yet we're alive), why it would take 600 beneficial mutations per generation to go from chimp to man in two million years (then find a mate with the same 240M mutations), why the sedimentary layers have so few micrometeorites despite the present high rate of deposition, why the sun continues to shrink yet was 'perfectly safe' 3 billion years ago, why the mathematics of evolution are absolutely totally mind boggling (an exponent of SIX digits!!!) - only then will I believe the assumptions behind Carl's religion.

{"review": "This is the best series I have ever seen, a real masterpiece. If you think you may find it interesting, don't hesitate for a moment and buy these DVDs now. No intellectually curious person could conceivably be disappointed by this piece of work.   Are you interested in our origins and those of our fellow living beings, our planet and our Universe? and in the origins of our knowledge and intelligence? want to know about our place in the Universe and whether we could have some neighbors out there in the stars? and what about our future and that of our planet, solar system and Universe? You will have a hard time finding better answers to these questions than those given by Carl Sagan in Cosmos. And it is remarkable how almost everything remains as true today as it was more than 20 years ago when Cosmos first appeared.  Images are often spectacular and music sublime. I recommend that you view these DVDs with the lights off and in a quiet environment. This is the best way for you to let Dr. Sagan guide you on this grand voyage of the imagination, which, among other places, will take you to the planets, stars and galaxies, the early Universe, to ancient Greece and Egypt, to the Great Library of Alexandria or to India and eighteenth century Holland.   Many of the 13 chapters have updates at the end. The updates were added in the 1990s, but there is, as far as I can tell, only one instance where even the update is outdated: small anisotropies were finally found in the cosmic microwave background radiation in the late nineties (Sagan died 1996), thus solving the mystery of how galaxies could have formed from a Universe that was initially very homogeneous. In any case, as I said, Sagan's words are, with very few exceptions, as valid today as they were 20 years ago.   Enjoy! ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "I have read some of the reviews for this series. I am certainly glad not everyone is trying to explain science to society. Carl Sagan could.  I watched this series as a teen in the 70's. I had only 4 channels of TV to watch and on Sunday nights, I would watch Cosmos.  Carl Sagan had a voice and intellect that would draw me in and make his topics so interesting. I see science shows today and realize that Cosmos certanily help them attain their status.   Carl Sagan set the standards in general and also opened many people's minds to science which led them to science careers. He simply connected the dots for those of us who could not at the time.   I would recommend this series to anyone interested in opening their minds to possiblities. ", "id": "75"}

I had never caught all the episodes on television, and now am very glad we have all thirteen. Carl Sagan is ageless and my four year old will enjoy watching him when he is old enough. Mr. Sagan even provided ten year updates on almost every episode. If you enjoyed watching \"Cosmos\" on television years ago, I urge you to buy it for posterity, especially since Mr. Sagan has passed away into his cosmos quite a while back. ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "I had this 13 hour collection on VHS  but considered it too important to entrust to magnetic tape. So, I had to get Cosmos on DVD. You see, this is something I wanted to have for the rest of my life. It is timeless knowledge, science at it's best, eloquently presented by the late, brilliant, Carl Sagan. It's not for everyone but if you have substance between your ear's, the importance of this creation will be obvious to you, too. ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "Well done NTSC DVD set! I also have the PAL DVD and VHS boxed set. Not sure why I bought the VHS boxing set both at the same time I purchased this NTSC DVD set, since VHS tapes are the antiquated gold standard in obsolete communication technologies. I guess, because of this, there are just some things in this universe that can't be explained. Be warned though, if you want to watch all thirteen episodes non stop, back to back, it will take approximately thirteen hours in real time, since all thirteen episodes are roughly one hour in length when belched back at the speed necessary to play back a one hour episode in a sixty minute time frame for best audio and picture quality. In other words kids, don't try cutting corners when viewing Cosmos by fast forwarding the DVDees to the end and then rewinding it back to the start, because the audio and picture quality just isn't there. I KNOW THIS because I TRIED THAT, and didn't learn anything that I didn't know before. Cosmos really makes me think hard about how we, the Earth, ever came into and continue to exist when completely surrounded by such a powerful, unforgiving, hostile environment that can pulverize us into nothingness when deadly gravitational load crush pressures, beyond that of human Sasquatch comprehension, can get out of hand. Highly Recommended!!!!!! ", "id": "75"}
{"review": "Cosmos is still relevant today. There may be some information that is less precise as we know now (as the estimated age of the universe) but Sagan does a remarkable job as narrator and presents even complex material in a way that is easily understood even if you do not have much exposure to science.

{"review": "I've always loved Sagan for his childlike joy of science. He demonstrates that there is no conflict between disciplined thought and study, and the joy and fun that is best associated with it. As I learn from him, I get more than the science, I get something warmer and fleshy, an emotional connection, something like love.   I've read many of his books, but Cosmos is to my knowledge the most easily absorbed and entertaining of his work. Learning at its deepest is not a purely intellectual process, but a very emotional one as well, even spiritual, setting the knowledge deeply and permanently into our minds. Sagan has therefore not only taught me science, but changes my awareness, struck me with awe.   Who needs God when we have nature as this wonderful man unveils it. ", "id": "75"}

Daughter Amber learned a huge life lesson by moving from a proving to a learning mindset.  She hit a brick wall in the 10th grade in algebra and the concepts in Mindset havehelped her power through her low test scores. I am ordering a second copy (one for her tutor) and Amber gets my copy! In spite of the book title, Mindset is not a magical self-help book, but instead packed with examples and stories we can all identify with. Thanks Dr. Dweck! ", "id": "86"}

{"review": "It is no wonder that Yoko Ono, who at first had the idea to authorize this biography, turned against it; as with so many biographies of John Lennon, in the end, the author was too biased to write a book that would have become the ultimate guide to Lennon's life, and it wasn't because he didn't have access to sources previously unavailable or unexplored--he did.  In the end, this book fails because of the lack of objectivity.  Mind you, it's still quite readable, still full of revelations and previously unrevealed moments and secrets, which make it a fun piece of work. But it was supposed to be a serious, scholarly look at Lennon, and it left out many things that would have added to the dimensions of this incredibly talented but ultimately troubled man; rather than explore some of the venues that would have been uncomfortable, it touched on them lightly, then left them alone.  There is also the fact that it is, in many ways, a hidden character assassination of Paul McCartney, whose relationship with Lennon lasted for so many years and underwent such a drastic downfall.  It completely hides the friendship that the two shared for so long, dwelling for pages instead on Lennon's relationship to Stuart Sutcliffe; even there, much is left out, including the birth of his longstanding and deep relationship with Sutcliffe's fiance, Astrid Kircherr, and the support and friendship he had with Klaus Voorman, who ultimately became a member of Manfred Mann.  In the end, this is less a book than a collection of anecdotes and inferences, a disappointment from the author who seems so proud that his prior book, SHOUT, is seen as \"the ultimate reference book on the Beatles\" (his exact words).  That may or may not be true--other books, written by those more directly involved have a better claim, at least in my opinion, but the real truth is while I enjoyed some of what I read and was astounded by other parts, it took me weeks to finish the book because I found it an overall disappointment in approach and execution.

This book takes a serious look at the inner man and makes you appreciate him even more. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "A well written and researched book on Lennon's personal history, his influences, triumphs and tragedys.  It is also a peek behind the curtain on his creative genius and a look at his psyche as well - his obsessions, fears and premonitions.  Not only for the Beatle fan but would be interesting for a psychologist on the inner workings of one of music's most influential artists in recent memory.  Also a cautionary tale for anyone who having grown up in the sixties and enjoyed Lennon's stance on peace and love; and who would've believed meeting and visiting with Lennon would have been a positive experience.  As Lennon himself once said -\"its the message not the messenger.\" ", "id": "2"}

{"review": "This is a new and wonderfully brilliant insight into what it is like to grow up as a girl in a violent, strict fundamentally Islamic ruled, war torn Iran. As a graphic novel, it lets the reader explore Marjane's creative, beautiful, yet brutal and honest life in 1980s Iran through touching and clever art and dialog. She struggles with what all youngsters do even in the hardest of times, such as relationships with her friends, parents and God. The artwork drives home her emotion and it almost feels like watching home movies while reading the diary of an honest young girl. I know that the movie that is out, but I'm honestly afraid to view it recalling how sometimes beloved books of mine are never brought justice on film. But it is using her illustrations and dialog so it seems to stand a chance, and hopefully drive home the message that holds on tightly to you throughout the book.  I urge anyone interested in this work to read the graphic novel first to really connect with Satrapi on his or her own terms and turf. Excellent excellent excellent!! ", "id": "2"}

The illustrations by Parker-Rees are extraordinary! My favorite page shows lions dancing the tango. And there's a secret to the book that you might not notice. Perhaps I shouldn't give it away, but each set of pages contains four tiny little characters hidden among the leaves and flowers: a cricket, a blue bug with a long nose, and a pair of one yellow and one red beetles. Try to find them. It's not easy! The cricket becomes an important character towards the end of the book.

As Roy and his wife,Helen, try to survive in T.V. land, literally, They rediscover why they fell in love in the first place. I just like the way that Roy would go to hell and back to get his wife back. Not to mention, you have an All Star Cast, You Got John Ritter, Pam Dawber, Jeffery Jones, and last but not least, Eugene Levy. All of which have excellent chemistry.

If you are a comic lover this is a must. if you like art, or literature it is a must read. if you don't like comics, this may change your mind completely. Comics owe a great deal to Scott McCloud.

{"review": "This book is amazing, because in simplistic terms in manages to establish comics as its own seperate art form.  McCloud identifies this third dimension in between depicted reality and figurative idea called the picture plane.  The plane, a combination of abstraction from images and writer's intent, forms a new union between thought and the way thought is projected.  I know all this sounds very technical, like this should be an exhaustedly trivial attempt in new philosophy.  It's defiinitely not.  It is drawn like a comic book.  Every idea is explained in a very engaging way  by using succint imagery to enhance the topic.  Essentially, he is using the medium of comics, a medium that is baser than literature or photography, to explain the necessity for comics.  I.e. an art form that makes ideas easier to understand, more compelling, entertaining and focused.    This book has turned me on to comics.  I really didn't care before.  It's genius!

I am a single Mom, and hadn't even thought about the right time to explain the facts of life, so I thought I would buy a book for the 2 of us to look at together.   After researching different books about Puberty for Boys, I settled on this book.  I flipped through the book before giving it to my son so I would know what exactly he would be looking at. Overall, the book is very good, and very informative and it explains all of the different topics in a way that kids can comprehend.  I did feel that some of the topics covered in the back of the book were a little too advanced for my 10 year old, so I made sure he didn't look at that section of the book. It was mostly stuff about STD's and Birth Control and some other stuff like that. I don't think he is ready for that right now, and I will give him the book back at a later date when he is ready to learn about that sort of stuff.   I would definitely recommend this to any parent that may need some help explaining body changes, and the Birds * the Bees. ", "id": "4"}

We all admit they are cute and wonderful, but so are all human beings so don't spoil them to the point of no return.  You may not even realize you are doing it.  Mrs. Friedman writes not about the cutesy, the mystical, the geneology.  She writes about the psychology which precludes all else.  She explains the necessity of helping twins realize they are separate individuals.  She shows how to do it.  My children didn't come with an instruction book, so be glad at least twins do!    I married an adult twin and had a terrible relationship with him.  I didn't know what hit me.  His twin was his spouse, not me.  He was basically having an affair with me.  It was a total nightmare.  Barnes & Nobles couldn't help me a few years ago because this book wasn't out yet!  Now I get it.  Don't drag your child down the line of what happened to my husband.  You have a chance, with this book, to be aware and make the necessary moves to assure your child has a proper childhood.  So he or she can grow up and have a meaningful relationship with their spouse and other adult people.  You don't want to have twins that stay together forever, never \"growing up\" and getting on with their life in a healthy, meaningful way that God intended for all adults.

{"review": "I thought this book had many good qualities and bad. One of the aspects I liked most was the vivid portrayal of how his various experiences in medicine have shaped his [Gawande's] character. In this attempt, Gawande writes much about the various times he has been in the ER and the some of the problems that he has encountered. I found quite a number of shortfalls while Gawande tried to do so however. For one, from the title, I more or less expected a \"surgeon's\" view of how surgeries go wrong and the thought that go through surgeons' minds when a problem occurs. I guess you could say that I wished the book had more first person experiences. Instead, Gawande often writes about the lives of patients impacted by surgery and the troubles they experienced before and, possibly, afterwards. As a pre-medical student, I would really like to hear a surgeon's first-hand view of how problems typically occur during surgery and how they are resolved.  Nonetheless, Gawande has strung together a wonderful collections of stories and anecdotes to portray how the lives of his patients have impacted his becoming a better surgeon and how surgery impacts not only the mind, but also the heart (metaphorically).

I happen to agree with him wholeheartedly and I have seen his advice work with my own patients and family members. He explains what supplements to take, how much to take and why. He also gives a diet plan and recipes. It is not super easy to be as disciplined as he advises, but if you are seeking clear healthy skin, it is less expensive than some cream at the department store that promises to make you look younger for a mere $75 an ounce!

There were a few areas that I didn't agree with totally, but it was nice to see a different perspective.  It has been a useful tool to give me insight into a boy's world...and it has helped handle situations and to know what is \"normal\" behavior and what issues need to be immediately addressed.

While the author specifically calls attention to the statistics of trying to raise boys without a strong father-figure, the strongest one I felt was how the number of jail inmates felt about their fathers.  On Mother's Day one year, a greeting card company allowed all the inmates to choose a free card for their mothers, and the line for this event was long.  The company thought to bring the event back for Father's Day, and not one inmate showed up to send a free card to their father.  I'm a mom, but I know that fathers can make or break their children's futures.  If you're a single mom and need advice, this book may make you feel helpless at first, but will give you guidance and encouragement as you read farther along. ", "id": "10"}

{"review": "Notes of the Universe is a great way to hear affirmations of how to focus your energy, and prefaced in a way by indicating that it is the \"Universe\" telling you these things, via Mike Dooley's narration!  His verbal style and affirmations are very casual and posed in brief sentences, with bursts of energy, warmth, and occasionally spoken with an innocent phrase, all using a positive view.    Mike Dooley has more than ample enthusiasm as he speaks the phrases and brings thoughts, feelings and statements, all meant to bring you to a positive, happy state of being and sort of pleasantly \"remind\" you of your place and empowerment of you within the Universe.  The nice part is that you can pause the cd, if you want to and continue with the other phrases later.  He's one of the rare ones who utilizes a \"breath\" in between his statements, so that you can absorb it.  This set of two cds is also true to form in getting exactly what you saw in \"The Secret\" movie.  It's also easy to play the cd, rather than read his \"Notes...\" book if you have little time to read a book.    His approach in the cds, though, is the same as you'd get if you go to his videos on youtube, in \"The Secret\" and his website.  He states in a variety of ways, the ability to find a positive view with yourself and everything that you do, and also to find that you are the programmer of the Universe.  You have the ability to create and revise your mind and anything in your life to your benefit.  (By the way, he has a website and you can sign up freely for his random \"Notes from the Universe\" subscription).    However, his book, 'Notes from the Universe' can be a better way to examine and create your own perspective.  My recommendation is to, if you have never heard of \"The Secret\" or seen his part in that movie, to watch that first.  What you see there you will get in his cds.    If you have tried other formal methods of positive thinking, then this will be quite an adjustment for you as Mike's way is a more relaxed, friendly approach in all aspects.   In terms of what I dislike, that is a personal preference, to a strong degree.  Again, his phrases are, at times, buoyant, innocent, and contains both current and past expressions, like, \"Whoo-hoo\", and other phrases.  Having an open mind is the best medicine, in this case.  If you're wanting something more formal, there are many others who will be more intellectual...  If you're wanting to really get your mind into a positive state, you may want to buy this CD set and get \"The Secret\" book, DVD or CD with it.  I wouldn't say this if I haven't read, listened to or watched a host of self-help, positive thinking, new age, self-improvement and studied several methods.

{"review": "While Aucoin does try to cover makeup in a broad sense, much of this book is made up of photos of movie stars that he has transformed into classic movie stars.  Gwyneth Paltrow as James Dean, comes to mind, as does Julia Roberts as Julie Christie, and Christy Turlington as Twiggy. He does an amazing job (Paltrow is practically unidentifiable as Dean), and it shows to what lengths makeup can improve, alter, and enhance the face.    Where Aucoin falls short is on practicality.  Sure, I'd love to paint myself up to look like Elizabeth Taylor (1960, not 2006), but where would I go?    I do think Aucoin is a true artist and master who had so much to teach.  I would have liked to have seen more technique in this one, though.  Buy it because it's Aucoin and a pretty cool coffee table book. ", "id": "10"}
{"review": "I had bought the book Making Faces by Kevyn Aucoin a few years ago and I knew this one would be even better. First off, if his books were just pictures of before and after photos it would be worth it.He is that talented.But add the great tips, visual guides and wonderful stories and it equals hours of reading. I am hoping to start a career in make-up artistry and this book along with his other titles is a great start.Kevyn's philosophy towards beauty and personal creativity is inspiring.Plus, where else can you see Martha Stuart as a drop dead ringer for Veronica Lake.

{"review": "Kevyn Aucoin does a good job of showing women how to do everyday makeup, including highlighting and lowlighting areas to emphasize the positive and unique features of each person. The beauty of this book though is in illustrating how makeup can be used to transform one's face for stunning and whimsical looks. I would recommend this to someone who is familiar with makeup but would like to learn how powerful a tool it can be. ", "id": "10"}
{"review": "Kevyn Aucoin was THE premier makeup artist to the stars. He had talent unlike anything anyone had ever seen. \"Face Forward\" is one of three books by or about Kevyn. It showcases and teaches you how to do a variety of looks. I'm a makeup artist, and love perusing this book! His instructions are so easy, you don't even have to be a pro artist to accomplish these looks! It's almost a paint-by-numbers approach, complete with a variety of ideas on which products or textures should be used. There is NOTHING to dislike! The artistry is fabulous, the photography is stunning. Just wait till you see what he did to some of your favorite stars! ", "id": "10"}

It has very good diversity in the subjects- even  making a man into a woman because of the bone structure he resembled model icon Linda Evangelista.

Two cons: some pictures are not great on resolution and some pictures look suspect to being altered to better the more famous subjects. ", "id": "10"}

My sourdough bread is no longer lumps of tangy flour conglomerations, but really very nicely textured, highly developed tartness, sourdough bread of the \"mid-coast California\" area.

{"review": "I picked up this book hoping for insight as a patient on how doctors think, but instead found a book that is written for someone with great medical experience.  Even as a retired nurse I still had to look up unfamiliar medical terms/diagnosis/tests/thought process like heuristics*, when a simple sentence added to the paragraph would have easily made sense of the terms for a layperson.  Dr Groopman is very fond of his excellent vocabulary and even I had to look up some of the \"big\" words and I consistently score excellent in the Reader's Digest Vocabulary Tests.  Even the last chapter, which was more along the lines I thought the book would be is difficult to understand unless you had read the entire book.  While I was able to grasp his reasoning someone without a medical background would probably have a hard time understanding key parts of the book.  If you have a medical background or have been a patient with considerable medical problems this book is great in giving you insight into why doctors make the diagnosis they make and how they come to that conclusion.  Some really great medical cases were discussed and I found this to be the highlight of the book.  If you are a lay person, plan on spending a lot of time on the Internet or with a dictionary and medical dictionary close at hand.  I give the book an average for the \"big words\" and \"medical terminology\" that could have been corrected by using terms a layperson could understand and by adding a little information to go along with the medical terms, after all do you know what an aortic tear is and where your aorta is located?  A glossary at the end of the book accompanied by a few simple illustrations of the body would cause me to rate this book as Super-excellent!!!  *You didn't think I'd leave you hanging on heuristics did you?

{"review": "I am a teacher who has been using this method to teach preschoolers, kindergartners, and first graders to read.  There is no better or faster way to teach reading.  In the largest educational experiment ever undertaken by the U.S. Dept. of Education, this method was conclusively proven to be the best method for teaching reading.  It was entitled the Direct Instruction model in Project Follow Through--a 10-year, billion-dollar project.  I used this method to teach my 30-year old son (who is now a high school English teacher) to read.  He learned to read when he was 2 years old.  My now 4-year-old granddaughter is reading close to a 4th-grade level---having been taught with this method.  I have used this method to teach English-language-learners to both speak and read English as well as teach their own children to read English.  One Vietnamese woman whom I was teaching to speak English taught her 3-year-old son to read fluently.  Another Hispanic English-language-learning mom in my class taught her pre-schooler using this method.  I then taught his kindergarten teacher how to use this method.  By the end of that student's kindergarten year, he was reading at about a 4th-grade level.    For the past 6 years, I have been teaching a class of moms with their beginning readers.  This, of course, is my textbook.  Each mom works one-on-one with her own child.  The kids make amazing progress!  I have also taught English-second-language adults to use this method with their children.  It has been similarly successful for them.  It is not difficult to use. ", "id": "8975347011"}

{"review": "This is a wonderful way learn to read, it focuses on the sound that letters make teaching the kids what sound they make beginning with s. Within a few lessons they are able to read a few short words. They learn the sound of s, m , e and a and in the lessons it teaches the kids step by step how to sound out words which is why this is so effective. They learn s makes a ssss sound like a snake. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to teach a child to read or help a child that is struggling with reading.       I originally bought this product twenty years ago to teach my four and five year old how to read.  I love the product. Children are able to read short books such as bob books when you are half way through the book.  The book is so simple to use.  I sent it to my sister who lives in another state a elementay school teacher and she used this for her kids.  Now my grandson is four and half I purchased a copy for him.  He is loving it. I do remember doing a few lessons a week and there were lessons we did only part of on certain days.  If i felt the kids getting frustrated we would review or do activities to reinforce what they had already learned.  we did art progects with the letters they learned an example would be me drawing a letter on construction paper and letting them glue macaronni on to it.  We also had a box top of colored sand or salt and let them draw the letters into the lid with their fingers.  We also showed dad when he came home the letter we learned that day.

{"review": "I found out about this book from a friend whose 4 year old went through just 60 lessons and can read better than most 6 or 7 year olds!  I bought it and it has been money well spent.  I have taught children to read with many different methods and this one is easy and direct.  One friend asked me what was different about this particular book.  I thought about it and believe the difference is that this is a very logical way to teach.  It is also geared for the parent who may lose his or her cool as they try to teach their own child.  It does not overwork the parent or the child. You simply follow word for word what the book says to say.  It even gives you how to tell the child they are wrong without yelling at them! If you are a parent you CAN teach your child to read or even help improve their reading skills.  Even though my son knows how to read it has improved his skills. I would certainly recommend for any parent to buy the book and spend 15 minutes a day helping their child improve their reading skills or just develop their  reading skills. ", "id": "8975347011"}

Over the last 18 years, I have had the privilege to teach every one of my children to read, using this simple yet profoundly efffective book.  We wore out 3 copies!  Each daily lesson takes about 10 minutes in the beginning, increasing to about 20 minutes per day at the end.  After 100 lessons, each of my children were reading at least at a strong second/third grade level.  Once you teach a child to love reading, you have given them the greatest educational gift possible.  I know of no better way to instill a love for reading than to have mom or dad teach it.  Your greatest challenge after this book will be to keep your child supplied with good books (check out sonlight.com for tons of great titles for all ages).  You don't need any special skills to use 100 Easy Lessons, everything is completely scripted for you.  I strongly recommend this book for anyone with a child ready to learn to read.

{"review": "We are home educators who have used this book to teach 5 of our 6 children to read. We bought a new one because after 7 years ours was worn out! Our kids are fantastic readers and I believe it's because they have gained a good foundation with this book. It is written in an extremely easy-to-use format and only requires 10-15mins of \"instruction\" per day to complete the lesson. Because my kids' small-motor skills aren't well developed until they're a little older we did not do the recommended writing exercises that accompany each lesson. However our kids were quite young when they went through the book (two of them completed the book and were reading well at age 3, two at age 5, and one at age 6; we are starting our 20-month old on the letter sounds since she can verbalize them).  On the negative side the stories aren't very interesting and didn't hold the kids' attentions very well. Also, they have the child pronounce \"the\" with a long-e sound at the end as in \"the-e\"...I just had them memorize it as a sight word instead of having them sound it out.   The positives of this book have greatly outweighed the negatives for our family and I highly recommend it. ", "id": "8975347011"}

I picked up this book for my son who was having difficulty with the reading lessons they taught at school.  By the end of Kindergarten he still couldn't read. So over the summer before 1st grade, I did one lesson a day with him for 3 months.  It works!  He caught onto the the lessons and was reading at a 2nd grade level going into 1st grade.  It is a little slow going at first, but I feel it's a necessary step.  The repeating of sounds is important to retain what you learn and not forget.  I highly recommend this book. I'm currently working with my youngest son now, and he's picking it up just as easily as my older son did years ago.  I must also add that both my boys have had a language delay - and that hasn't hindered us one bit.  In fact, I think it's significantly helped their language and comprehension skills.

{"review": "My son is (...) very bright. He had letter recognition and understood most of the letter sounds before we started this book (since he was about [quite young]), so this method gave me a format to teach him. When he kept insisting to learn how to read and began sounding out words on his own, often incorrectly, I knew it was time to start a program.  Now he's so excited that he's learning how to read... he loves reading lesson time! For him, the pace is slow, and repeatative, but I'm able to modify. We're doing two to three lessons every day. I've caught him picking out letter sounds in every day life: a sign at the grocery store, a word on a magazine etc..  This is a perfect method for the child who is ready to launch into reading. After establishing the basics this book offers, then you can go onto more complex methods.  I strongly suggest simply reading to your child often. The method in this book will teach the fundamentals, but only enjoying stories will foster the love of reading. ", "id": "8975347011"}

It was easy to use, some lessons were maybe too easy and we skipped a few (he knew what sound B makes for instance).

If you can read, then you can teach your child to read with this book in just 10-20 minuets a day. It really is that easy. The only reason this book gets a good instead of great from me, is because I found The Ordinary Parents Guide to Teaching Reading; which is along the same lines, only has double the lessons and works up into more difficult words and reading levels.

{"review": "I have just gotten this book and read the message for the parents--which can take some time to read. It is a system for reading and not like the phonics...it seems it would work well with the program Teaching Your Baby to Read (the DVD set) if you start them out early.  I have been meaning to get this book for years and was glad to find on sale on ebay for less then half what I could have paid for it.  It teaches your child more to read by the sounds of the letters MORE then teaching them what the letter is more what it represents. They are learning to read the words rather then sounding out, which most words in English do not sound as they are spelled. Much like teaching a child to play the piano by teaching them songs first then later teaching them how to read music---which I understand is more effective.  You could use this book to beging reading and then later teach phonics ect.... it requires parental interaction to be successful, so if you are not willing to spend the time for 100 lessons then it will not work.  As stated above, I would suggest getting this book and purchasing the DVD set I listed above for young toddlers and working with them toward reading. Later, you can focus on what the letters are called ect... in the phonics programs.   I would recommend this for homeschoolers as schools using the other methods of teaching and may confuse the child, however if you teach PRIOR to sending the child to school it may work that way!

As a homeschool mother you tend to go through a few curriculums and methods before you find the one that works for each child since they all learn differently. We were struggling and this lesson book and the simple lessons helped. It's progression builds and by the end of the book my childs reading fluency was improved. As we move on in our regular reading lessons I can see how the lessons we learned and repeated have helped with decoding more challenging words. I wish I had found this book early on when we were just learning but better late than never. ", "id": "8975347011"}

And no, he is not a dumb kid, but he did not quite get the idea of sounds in relation to letters. You will understand what I mean when you read the introduction section of the book.

The impact on the children by many of the parenting styles is nicely portrayed. The authors also present a clear, concise, and cogent discussion of much of the gender variant spectrum – they nicely make the point that not all children with different gender presentations are transgender. I recommend this for counselors, therapists, psychologists and educators who deal with children. It is also a “must buy” for parents who have gender variant children.

{"review": "I love this book because it presents the complete words of a \"last lecture\" given by Carnegie Mellon university professor Randy (Randolph) Pausch.  When most of us hear the word \"lecture,\" we tend to think \"boring and pedantic.\"  Not so with this particular \"lecture.\"  Given by a young professor who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, this lecture is positive, humorous, life-affirming, encouragement to \"follow your dreams,\" examples of how \"going after what you desire / achieving your goals\" doesn't always require genius - just hard work and/or tenacity,... and many other wonderful tips /views on living your life to the fullest!  The \"Last Lecture\" is an on-going Carnegie-Mellon event.  I had not known anything about it (the event), or about this particular lecture (by Dr. Pausch), until someone sent it to me in video format.  I watched the video and thought it's message (and the humor with which it was delivered) to be wonderful and inspiring!  When I came across the book containing the entire lecture (the text, and photos of Dr. Pausch from childhood onward), I was thrilled to be able to buy it, and therefore read any section of it repeatedly!  It truly is uplifting!    It offers (in \"everyman\" language) such a positive approach to living, that it is a joy to read!  It is not a \"self-help\" text, but one man's view of what \"living fully\" means.

{"review": "I received and email video of Randy Pausch giving his \"Last Lecture,\" and was moved to purchase the book. Interestingly, professors at the college where he taught were periodically asked to give a \"Last Lecture\" detailing what they would do if they found out they were dying, how they would feel, what was most important to them. Randy Pausche had just found out he had terminal pancreatic cancer when he gave his lecture. His lecture was not on dying, but on living.  Both the video lecture and the book were uplifting, humerous at times, and a wonderful look into the life of this amazing man who, by virtue of his illness first, gave an inside view as to the early years of his life, he was blessed with an outstanding upbringing, and into adulthood and his life with his family and young children. The lecture was initially for his children, I believe, and addressed dreams and overcoming obstacles in life, among much other information. Most of this \"lecture\" was reserved for his children and part of it is not available to the public as it is for his family alone. This man lived a wonderful life and shared a great love with his family.  He was intelligent, gentle, and his philosopy on life an inspiring lesson to all. I highly recommend the book, which is also available in audio. My plans are to buy several copies for gifts. It is one of the best writings I have read in years. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This book is from the last lecture given by Randy Plausch, professor at Carnegie Mellon University.  Mr. Plausch wrote this while dying of pancreatic cancer, but the lecture is not about cancer or dying, but about living with gusto and achieving your childhood dreams.  He died Friday, July 25, 2008, but LIVED to the end.  If anyone can read this book and NOT be inspired, they may need to read it again.  Mr. Plausch appears to live the \"mach 10 with your hair on fire\" life, defying death to the end.  The book and his life challenge a person to go beyond their normal limits.  He shows that you don't have to be a professor, a type A personality, the head of the class, or anything that you consider successful to realize that you can reach for the highest dreams and goals in life by mentally eliminating the ceilings or limits you normally place on yourself.  If you read about him or have seen him interviewed, Mr. Plausch was obviously a person who pushed the envelope and inspired others to do the same.  The book makes me get up in the morning and realize that if I'm still alive I'd better get out and go for the gusto.  Good inspirational read for almost any age--good gift for any occasion.  I've been reading it with my teens. ", "id": "2"}

As a life-long learner, Randy Pausch's words inspire me - I continue to savor these wise, wonderful words on the pages. The depth of emotion and energy leap from this book into one's mind, heart and soul. His philosophy of life will lift you up and hold you aloft! His reminder about embracing life and throwing ourselves headlong into what we desire inspires change. It is not enough to have dreams. One must honor them and seek the fulfillment of them in this life. There is no time to wait. Randy Pausch died recently. He lived his dreams for the now - there was no later for him!

Instead of dwelling on the inevitable, he made decided to make the best of the time he had left with his family, friends, students, and fellow teachers.    Randy gives many lessons throughout this book.  There are many stages of life Randy takes us through.  I would think that anyone could relate to portions of this book.  Randy really makes you think about what life is worth and how you could improve it.  He even throws in a lot of harsh realities.  I highly recommend this book.  I think it should be a book given out at young adulthood and then read again later in your life!  I will be searching for videos of his last lecture after reading this book. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I bought this book because it was recommended to me by my trainer in the Primerica business my husband and I are part of.  This book was very easy to read, but also very deep.  I was amazed that this man could have such a positive outlook even though he was diagnosed with a terminal illness.  I expected it to be really sad because of that, but found myself, instead, inspired to make the most of every day, and to be grateful (and not take for granted) the many blessings in my life.  I loved that he had such a desire to leave a lasting legacy for his children -- as a parent I believe that is so important.  The Last Lecture was truly a reminder to live life to the fullest, to see the good in every situation, to dream big and think forward, and to pass all that on to our children and to others with who we come in contact.  I think anyone could benefit from reading this book. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I saw this on Oprah and couldn't wait to get the book. This is an amazing story of courage, hope, faith, and love by Jeff Zaslow. A professor with a terminal illness that is doing this for his 3 small boys. If you didn't get a chance to see part of this on Oprah, you are missing out. You can go to Youtube to find it. You will cry, laugh, and want to know more about this amazing man and his last lecture. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I liked the book very much. I am glad Randy Pausch was able to leave it as a legacy to his children. I had heard about the concept of last lectures, but this one really was. It is heartbreaking to hear of his early death due to pancreatic cancer, but he offered a lot of insight about living and never really seemed to feel sorry for himself. We all need to remember it really is about being able to set goals for your life and then being able to complete them. We need to live like we have only a limited amount of time left, because we really do. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "It is an eye opening book about how to live out your own childhood dreams. Randy tells the world in his last lecture how to do just that and how to live each day to the fullest. A brave account from a dying man with cancer- he shows all of us to make eveyday count! ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Very inspiring book by a man who could have spent his last days wallowing in despair.  A must read for anyone who is a cancer survivor or unfortunately has had to deal w/ cancer attacking a loved one.  But beyond that, he teaches you small life lessons w/ every chapter that turn out to be life changing.  As a parent, my favorite one was about him drawing on his bedroom walls and instead of his parents getting furious at him (as most of us would) they let it alone and actually kept his room as it was into his adulthood. The lesson being- it's only paint, and it can be repainted- don't sweat the small stuff. In a busy world, we often need reminded of this.  It will open your eyes and make you appreciate every thing in life- big or small. I'm so happy he wrote this book and I pray for his family ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I bought this book not too long ago and read it on a long car ride. I couldn't put the book down. It was insightful and based on life experiences that an average person can relate to. I loved how the author was realistic about his cancer, but focused on how he achieved his childhood dreams and his family through the ordeal. This book is on the short side, but the message is quick and to the point. This book will help someone reflect on their own life. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I decided to buy Mr. Pausch's book, after hearing so much about him.  He was such a brilliant person.  I read his book in a day!!!!!  It was wonderful!!!!  The path he took & so publicly shared, will help so many others of us, who will someday have to make the same journey.  My favorite excerpt, was when he talked about the creations he made on his wall, while growing up.  My son, who is 8 years old, is an advid football fan.  I went into his room, not too long ago, and he had taped several pictures of his favorite players on his wall.  I immediately thought about Mr. Pausch and smiled, for in each of us, there lies such interesting talent.  Although I was never able to meet Mr. Pausch, I will forever remember him, for his book taught such a wonderful lesson in living!!!! I would recommend this book to everone, young and old!!!!!!!! ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I bought this book because I wanted to know Randy's story.  He had a message of great importance.  This book deals with his living and not dwelling on the fact he was dying of cancer.  Randy made me think about my life and the direction my life should be taking.  It also gave me a sense of knowing what to say to people who are terminally ill.  I laughed and cried while reading this book. He was a remarkable man and he did his best to let his children know who he was.I recommend this book to be read by all. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This book is a living tribute by Randy. It is well written, easy to read and contains wonderful thoughts and feelings for anyone close to death.  We should be very glad he was able to share this with all of us.  Lucky are those who have the time to plan as he did. There is never enough time. My favorite part is about the stuffed animals.  Never grow too old or sick to have fun. How would you deal with life knowing you have pancreatic cancer and it is eating away your body little by little. There is no cure at this time. Great inspiration for all who are dealing with a terminal disease. Also any family members who know someone who with a terminal disease. Highly recommend this book to everyone. It will make you think. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I was very touched by the book, maybe because of the fact that the author passed away on July 25th. The book to me clearly is a declaration of love to mankind, and to his family in particular. A few of his ideas I may try and build into my daily routine. His family is very lucky to have had him. The passage where he says that he was the first man ever to fall in love with his daughter made me cry. His positive attitude certainly is contageous, and worth being passed on to others. 'Never take anything for granted, an definitely seize the moment.' The paragraph where the one friend of his describes passing a convertible that's driven by a guy who drums his fingers on the driver's door, and has this big grin on his face really made me smile. Special to me also were the paragraphs where Randy's message is to begin things from zero, scratch false pride, and try new things, to put a lot of effort into doing things even though they may not always carry the promise of reaching one's goal/s. Interesting to me were the parts about making people aware of what it truly means to be a team member, and what it requires to become one. All in all, a noteworthy book that I will recommend to anyone who, in geeral, has an interest in intelligent literature. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "The Last Lecture is a heart felt book that explores the life of the late Randy Pausch. His devotion to his work and his family is strongly felt throughout the book and the overall spirit the book leaves you with is a great feeling. It is short enough to finish quickly, but not so short that you would not want to re-read it again. I highly recommend the book to any and everyone. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Randy Pausch articulates a positive approach to life...and death ... that most of us can only hope to emulate.  Inspiring, humorous and heartfelt, this author's narrative brings both a smile and tears for a life finished much too soon.  Most of us can only hope to fulfill our dreams and live our lives as richly as this man did.  He has surely left a legacy for his wife and children but in doing so has left a tremendous legacy to the rest of us who have been privileged to share in his journey and his powerful message and life force.  What a wonderful approach to life and a wonderful family to share it with!  God bless you and your family, Randy Pausch! ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "One of the most inspirational books I have ever not been able to put down.  I saw a clip on TV about the author, but never did I expect a book that sends a powerful message of strength, true love and a positive influence from a man who will never know how many people he has made such an impact on.   I bought an extra copy and gave it to a dear friend as a gift.  He came to work the next day and exclaimed \"I lost my book!\" ... his wife grabbed it and he's been unable to get it from her since.   For those who are well, or those who are facing tragedy, you will learn from this author ... ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Very inspiring book, an affirmation of life.  This book is a very fast read, relatively short and moves quickly.  Although one knows from the beginning that the author, Randy Pausch, has died, the book is about life and how to live it in a productive, positive way.  This is a wonderful gift to give to new parents to share with their children. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Loved this book.  Cried the whole way through it.  Made me really re-think if I would want to know if I was going to die or not. Gave me many things to think about it and made me really feel for this man and his family. After completion, I  immediately googled the author to see his family's present-day status.  I was recommended to read this book, and then I bought it as a gift for another friend. Very very good book and easy read....a real page-turner. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This book is everything that most people would want to say to their children, at least if we, knowing that we are dying, could rise above our self absorption.   Knowing the author's circumstances, I was prepared for a little mobidity---not at all--in fact, he is quite humorous in places.  I found it amazing that at this juncture in life, the author could look back and laugh at his own fallibilities.  While there is little direct reference to organized religion, the author's faith in a higher power appears strong and comforting.  This book is totally upbeat yet down to earth--the book you wish you had written for your own children and the book you hope that your children read as they are raising your grandchildren.   This is one book that I purchased AFTER I read it so that I could reread.  I also recommended it for a book club discussion--won't that be interesting? ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "As I have coached in High School for 15 years, I found this book to be a road map for better instruction. It's about what is good in the human spirit. It dwells on the POSITIVE IN LIFE and helps the reader see what is really important, and what isn't. Although Randy Pausch is dead now, this self help book lives on. It should change the way you relate to life, for the better. Live your dreams! Stay positive! Help others! The Dali Lama couldn't have said it better. Thanks Randy! ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I had heard great things about this book from the hosts on a lcal radio show. After the author died recently I decided I really wanted to check it out. The book has some details that describe names of this person from that department at this school, blah blah blah names that don't mean anything to me. However these people were very important to the author and do serve a purpose. At the end of the book you realize it wasn't really written for the general public, and these names are extremely important to the intended audience. It is filled with wisdom we all can use and appreciate, even more so when you figure out the purpose for this book being written. I highly recommend this book to ANYONE. I would recommend it to terminally ill persons, their families, their friends, their caregivers, anyone who works with these patients, anyone with a heart beating in their chest. After all aren't we all terminal? From the moment we are born, we begin our journey toward our end. Time is not a luxury, it is a responsibility. Use it wisely. Pay it forward. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I love that the author, Randy Pausch, decided to share such a difficult time in his life with others.  It is a book that all should read; there is love, understanding, faith, wisdom and much more that we can all learn from Randy!  Thank you and God Bless, Laura Owen ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I bought the book because a family member suggested I read it. Because I always worry about everything. I saw a little how it could pertain to me but not much. I thought randy took the thought of having cancer really great. He accepted it and made his life great. Him leaving a lecture taped for his children about his life and theirs was brilliant. They will always have that whenever they want to watch it. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I watched the lecture online. I was amazed as his words.  Other than his \"Last Lecture\" talk, was his other talk about \"Time Management\". The Time Management speech was probably the most useful information in my life. It not only applies to students like me, but even working individuals seasoned through many years of experience.  \"Time Management\" is more useful for people who have their eyes set on their careers already. But the \"Last Lecture\" is great for people who haven't gone that far yet, and are still figuring out what they want to do with their lives.   A highly recommended book for young people. For the less-inspireable people, just watch his lectures. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Worthwhile to read, of course, since it's one person's life experiences that may pertain to you. These experiences are fairly short, so there's no real \"theme\" here, although I really can't relate to terms such as \"karma.\" But some experiences have themes and we forget some of them so they need to be repeated and reinforced. This is what the book is good for. I admire Randy Pausch and wish I had the same courage he had as he faced death. He was very, very fortunate to have an obviously loving, caring wife and, unfortunately, I am a single man 70 years old who will die alone. But it made me realize that I don't necessarily have to think this way and I think that's what I will take most from this book ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I've heard the Last Lecture by Randy Pausch a couple times, but this really bought it to life for me. It expands on his presentation and makes it very personal. I recommend this book to anyone searching for a way to live a little happier. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I saw Randy Pausch give his Last Lecture on OPRAH a few years ago.  After that I have often thought of him, his children, and his wife.  Of course, after his death, I was very sad that his family lost such a great man.  I knew I had to read the book.  I had to know more about this husband and father. The man that put family first, even as he faced death. God bless his memory. God bless his family. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I was required to read this book for a college course.  I was sort of looking forward to it because I had seen it on Oprah and am from near Pittsburgh, where the lecture was given, so I was familiar with Mr. Pausch's story.  Once I read this book, though, I felt very inspired because this man is reflecting on the things that helped him to accomplish many, many great things.  Even though he had a terminal illness, that factor really didn't come into play for me during this book.  While it is definately a theme, it is not the most predominant.  This book is absolutely great for anyone looking for an inspiring story or just some way to live their life a little more to it's fullest. ", "id": "2"}

I was very interested to see what Randy had to say about living life to the fullest, no matter how much time we have.  I was surprised by the tiny size of the book initially, but was impressed with the way Randy expressed his views on childhood, parenthood and career.  I enjoyed this read and would recommend it to anyone especially someone with any conflicts about family and how to try to become at peace with your life choices. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I purchased the book because I had seen him on tv special and was moved by him.  The book was excellent in my opinion, it just made me think of things differently about certain things.  The mind is a terrible thing to waste and different options or opinions aren't bad either.  I am a nursing supervisor and the one quote that caught my eye and I try to do every day is, \"Just because you are in the drivers seat doesn't mean you have to run over people.\" I have given the book for others to read also and they have passed it on and have enjoyed as much as I did. ", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I throughly enjoyed reading The Last Lecture. It is a sensitive story of a man fighting to preserve some memories for his wife and children before he passes away from terminal pancreatic cancer. The popularity of this book made it impossible to find in any of the local bookstores or libraries in my community, so I searched Ebay and found it there.  The purchase went smoothly and I received my book in only days.  I finished reading the book in only four hours.  I would recommend it to all readers. ", "id": "2"}

{"review": "I find this book to be so inspirational that you have to keep it close by. This is the type of book that you can sticky note pages and hi-lite things that really make you think. Sort of like a  How To book... A lot of thoughts came to mind in reading this book. Self-reflection on how I would handle something like this if it were to happen to myself or husband. What about our children? What about things that need to be done?   I liked how he admitted in being a recovering jerk. How he's the first man to fall in love with his daughter. How privately him and Jai would cry together. It's raw and real.   Most of all, it's ok to dream and dream big! ", "id": "2"}

He was so involved in his family and making a lasting memory for his children. I think this is one must read. ", "id": "2"}

{"review": "i bought this book after seeing Randy Pausch on 20/20 and Oprah. the book followed along with much of what he talked about on the two shows but it was still worth the read. it takes the reader into the life of a person dealing with pancreatic cancer while trying to parent 3 young kids and still be a husband. it can be considered a motivational read but goes well beyond that. it is well worth the cost and you wont be able to put it down.

{"review": "A book/topic all parents should know more about.  Lice has infiltrated even the most affluent communities.  As a former teacher I've seen students mocked/ostracized  when there was a POSSIBILITY that they had lice.  When a student did have lice they were treated like they had the plague.  I wish I did a better job teaching my students about what lice are, how you get them, what to do to get rid of them, and how prevent them from coming back.  These authors have done a great job explaining the problem and offering non-toxic child friendly (and Earth friendly) solutions.  Their web page is also very informative and I'd recommend going there right away (search using their names) if you're dealing with the problem now since you can download and watch their information NOW rather than wait for the book.  I would recommend getting the book too, though, so you can have it as a reference for the future.  Personally I bought the book even though my child isn't even in school yet.  I know a lot, but not enough.  I'd rather be prepared than panicked myself.    ALSO, if you've experienced having your child bring lice home and the resulting stigma left on your family you may want to consider buying this book for your child's teacher.  There are resources on the author's web page for schools so they can better educate their students.  There's a DVD you can buy that the teachers can show that in itself would do a lot of good for the rest of the class to see.    One last thing... I learned from these authors that there are even services that will come to your house to nit pick for you!  Can you belive it?!  Here in Chicago there are \"Hair Fairies\" that you can go to.  What a whimsical way to deal with an icky problem.  I hope you are looking for more information and not dealing with the issue, but if you are I wish you luck!      I don't mean to go on and on, but I'm surprised to be the first to review this book.  The only thing I can think of is that people interested in it are dealing with it now and don't have time to wait for it to come or don't want to admit that they had lice in their family.  It happens and it't not the end of the world. ", "id": "10"}

IT WASN'T AS CREAMY AS EXPECTED; BUT IT WAS STILL VERY EASY TO BLEND AND THE COLOR GAVE ME A GLOW THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET WITH TRADITIONAL COLORS.

{"review": "Firstly, let's get some minor things outta the way...  Fer all you sad, unaware people, this book was meant to educate ignorants (normal folk, really) of zombie survival. The book takes itself seriously, and you, the reader, should more or less adhere to the rules of the guide. It gives rather detailed information on gun specs, how to use them, when to use them, what they should be used fer, what not to use (in a zombie outbreak), and where to get them. Actually, this may be a bit of a treat fer gun-lovin, gun-toatin' citizens. Now, this don't mean to go 'round shootin up a buncha people because you suspect they may be a zombie! Don't do that! In fact, the Brooks' guide advises AGAINST such actions! The guide is to prepare you fer the worst of the zombie apocalypse. All you need to know this book will tell you. If you feel that some information is wrong, or Brooks is misinformed, feel free to contact him and share yer opinions about the dreaded zombie hordes that could soon plague our beloved, and fer-granted, Mother Earth.  ------- The book is quite easy to read and understand. Brooks does not use complicated syntax or overly ostentatious words. There will be puns, however. It is a quick read, but vital nonetheless. The actual \"guide\" part of the book is about 181 pages (outta 272), and then the rest them pages are recorded zombie accounts from all over the world. Make sure you read those too! They'll tell you what people've done in the event of utter chaos, good and bad.   The table of contents in the very beginning spreads everything out fer you. The chapters are divided accordingly: *The Undead: Myths and Realities *Weapons and Combat Techniques *On The Defense *On The Run *On The Attack *Living In An Undead World *Recorded Attacks The very first chapter-section \"The Undead: Myths and Realities\" tells you what a real zombie IS. It also tells you about the traditional Voodoo zombies (which are real) and movie-magic zombies (which are based on, but are not actual zombies most of the time).  Each chapter-section has its own subset of topics to cover. All are full of invaluable information to get you from point A to Z in the life of a survivor. Read through all of these sections, and when yer done... DO IT AGAIN!  You'll be taught (or told advice) about staying in shape during the Zombie Apocalypse, looking fer proper shelter (but almost never a permanent home), securing a house/building/edifice against groves of the undead or bandits/gangs, scouting fer food/supplies/help/survivors, keeping zombies away as well as post-zombie-apocalyptic bandits and pirates, travelling as light as possible through day and night, riding in the right vehicles/automobiles & when they are appropriate, using weaponry to yer advantage, travelling over various terrain, surviving in the harshest climates/environments on Earth, recreating civilization after the \"end of the world\", possibly living as one out of the handful of survivors in an Undead World, & much more! ------- I enjoy reading this book. It's a fun experience as well as an important life-saving manual. It's not that expensive either (no more than $11 or $12 on the Internet). I feel a lot safer now that I have this guide in my hand. I'll have to keep it within reach should any situation occur. No government cover-ups... yet. I will definitely be on the look-out fer any sign of the undead. In the mean time, I'll be training and preparing fer what could be a zombie outbreak. Goodluck to yall.  Peace ", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Let's face it: at one time or another we've all faced a zombie scare we aren't prepared for. And yes, the local constabulary usually cleans things up with a minimum of fuss, but what happens when things go wrong and the cavalry doesn't arrive? That, my friends, is the day that Max Brooks' \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" saves your life. With several millennia worth of field experience distilled into a manageable 254 pages, everything you need to know to survive the coming war with the undead can be found in these pages. Your life and the lives of those you love are at stake, act now and be prepared! OK, so that paragraph was obviously tongue in cheek, but hopefully in conveys some sense of what Brooks' remarkable \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" is like. While obviously a parody of both the horror genre and civil defense/survivalist manuals, it maintains an \"all-business\" demeanor, never once cracking the façade to reveal the underlying humoristic intent. The result is a book that is, when taken as a whole, a funny, incredibly thorough work of satire. However, at the same time, page-by-page, it is a rather accomplished addition to zombie horror.  Starting with zombie physiology and then moving on to weapons, tactics, long-term strategy and history Brooks has produced a manual which has a thoroughness that belies the absurdity of its subject. Point by point he discusses the pros and cons of rifles, machetes and flamethrowers, then considers the optimal defensive positions for various types of outbreaks. After an extensive discussion of survival in a zombie doomsday scenario, he lays out zombie outbreaks through history, and what their implications are. Throughout, entries are extensively cross-referenced and alternative courses of action are always weighed for potential risks and benefits.  The remarkable thing about all this is that Brooks has managed to infuse a tension, and urgency into his manual that makes for great reading. Part post-apocalyptic fiction, part \"Night of the Living Dead\" and part \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, this is a book that should hold appeal across a broad range of genres. Thorough without being dry, creepy without being clichéd, and funny without relying on cheap laughs, \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" is undoubtedly one of the most original books I have ever read, and one that I enjoyed reading immensely. If you appreciate any or all of these genres, or if you just enjoy a well executed, original idea, this is definitely a book you'll want to check out.  And remember...Tomorrow may be too late, read this book today!  -Xsjado911- ", "id": "17"}

Author Max Brooks gives advice on how to keep your head from falling into the hands of the undead.

{"review": "Ever wonder if the world will soon be infected with a horrid disease that becomes so vile that the world becomes the walking undead? Well, Max Brooks, writer of \"The Zombie Survival Guide\" has written a guide on how to fight off the brain-hungered infestation. Any rumors you've heard about zombies, will be defined by this book. All the information in this book is just so realistic, you feel like you have to protect yourself. The book informs every little imformation: zombie senses, real truth about zombies, what to have, what to wear, how to stay clear of a zombie area, etc. IMO, Max has done himself very well with this book. Though it has been labeled as \"Humor\", it should fall into the \"How To\" books. It just seems so realistic!  My rating: 5*STARS/5*STARS ", "id": "17"}
{"review": "The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks.  What is there to say?  Well for one this is a excellent read.  You can easily pick it up, read a few pages, and put it down, so it makes it a great purchase for a casual reader, yet has enough content to satisfy a more hardcore reader like myself.  The book is laid out much like a guide, so literary style really is not applied much here, as its mainly a teacher teaching through written word if you understand my meaning.  Grammar and flow are great, even though I tend to be lenient on any hardcore literary rules since if its enjoyable I don't care to much.  The book does include some illustrations, which help convey the almost crudeness of the zombie in the way the artist depicts various things in a complete by more rigid style I suppose I would say.  The book is a good size, and the cover is sturdy and the whole effect really feels like your reading the real deal, although of course it is purely fiction.  Which brings up probably my only \"complaint\" in that the ideas listed only offer how to defend and defeat this specific type of \"zombie\".  Many of the ideas are of course cross type capable, but you will sometimes think to yourself that some things seem a little stupid or whatnot, but you have to remember to take it in the context of these specific zombies, and the idea that the world has had to deal with them for thousands of years.  All in all its an excellent book.  Fun, riveting, and even a little creepy at times.  If you are at all a Zombie fan, you should definitely consider picking up a copy of this wonderful book.

{"review": "The Author, Max Brooks, is a brilliant and thorough writer. His book is not only a humourous take on how to dedicate one's life to preparedness in case of local and national disaster, he also reminds the reader that life can be interrupted unwillingly. This books takes the horror genre to a new level by giving the zombie factor a viral name and brings a realistic approach on the possible devastation of our great nation. I suggest that readers keep this book on hand and use its contents to have their home prepared for a national disaster. Not only for the sake of being prepared for the 'what ifs' of the world, but for the imminant zombie infestation to come.   A must have book along with military training guides. =D  You'll never regret acquiring a copy of The Zombie Survival Guide. ", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Max Brooks, kin to legendary film director/actor Mel Brooks, has found a glaringly obvious niche to be filled in the Zombie Undead world of fiction - how to survive in it!  This is a must have for any Zombie fan!  The drawings are pretty crude, but this is not a mass produced high dollar novel.  It's more or less a handbook.  There are techniques on defense tactics as well as weaponry (a machete is best - it's quiet, saves ammunition and completely disables the attacker); Failure and Plan B situations; stealth movements - balance and posture; food and rations; escape vehicles (a bicycle is recommended - it's quiet and has better manueverability); and many, many more creative ways to stay alive.  The book does seem to extend the farcical fictional joke of Zombie Survival, like a person who tells a joke and then continues to add on to that joke extending it out ad-nauseam.  But, when the dead rise to consume the flesh of the living...this would be a good book to hold onto. ", "id": "17"}
{"review": "This is a pretty excellent book for anyone interested or obsessed with zombies.  It is a concise analysis of the undead threat and how to prepare for it.  Brooks takes everything into account and presents this book as a worst-case survival manual used to prepare for and survive a zombie attack of any kind.  Brooks also wrote World War Z, a book of accounts taken from The Zombie War.  I read this book first and I would highly recommend it.  While World War Z is a purely fictional account and The Zombie Survival Guide is more of a how-to book, they share many similar elements and ideas.  While the Survival Guide is interesting, after reading World War Z it was a disappointment.  If you are going to read only one of the two, I would overwhelmingly recommend World War Z, but if you plan on reading both read the Survival Guide first and you won't be disappointed. ", "id": "17"}

{"review": "The Zombie Survival Guide is a book that you can't stop reading! If your a Zombie fan, or horror fan this book is a must read! Max Brooks explains what to do to protect yourself if zombies were real. He gives specific scenarios and describes the best way to escape alive. The best part of the book is how he describes zombies, facts and myths. He also goes into great detail into the sociology of the zombies and explains why a zombie exists.

There is a fair amount of humor to keep your interest if the subject material isn't doing a good enough job.    Bottom line?

Its actually really creepy if you don't know that its fictional. Max Brooks teaches you how to get ready for and survive a zombie attack. Its kind of funny because the stuff he has you take along is just rediculous. He tells you to travel light, and then lists an insane amount of stuff to bring with you.

{"review": "ZOM-BIE: (Zom¢be)n.also ZOM-BIES pl.1. An animated corpse that feeds on living human flesh. 2. A voodoo spell that raises the dead. 3. A Voodoo snake god. 4. One who moves or acts in a daze“like a zombie.”[a word of West African origin] What is a zombie? How are they created? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What are their needs, their desires? Why are they hostile to humanity? Before discussing any survival techniques, you must first learn what you are trying to survive. We must begin by separating fact from fiction. The walking dead are neither a work of “black magic” nor any other supernatural force. Their origin stems from a virus known asSolanum, a Latin word used by Jan Vanderhaven, who first “discovered” the disease. ", "id": "17"}

{"review": "I was lucky enough to have heard nothing about the book when I first read it back in probably 2004 or 2005. I saw a friend reading it, and he let me take a look at it. I returned it two days later, having read it cover-to-cover. I am now purchasing the book for myself to read again - it was really that entertaining. My favorite thing about the book is how seriously every possible aspect of the zombie phenomenon is addressed. I was so impressed the first time with the detail it went into, after the first time I read it I would have honestly not been suprised to see a horde of zombies the next day.   Skeptics would probably not even finish the book, although skeptics are probably rarely big sci-fi fans. Suspend your disbelief a bit and this book can actually be quite eye-opening. Really, I can imagine this book being an extremely love - hate item. ", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Fiction?  Perhaps.  Fun to read?  Definitely.  Interesting?  Most definitely.  A must read?  Likely.  Needed information?  Possibly.  I found this book to be most informative.  I bought this book because I feel that a time of the \"walking dead\" could be possible and would rather be informed and prepared instead of un-prepared and dead.  I'm just saying that a \"zombie apocalypse\" could happen with todays technologies and psycho's in positions of power.  50 years ago Flash Gordon was big-time sci fi, and now we've been to the moon and the space station numerous times.  20 years ago we all chuckled when Captain Kirk radioed the Enterprise to \"beam him up\", today almost everyone has a cell phone.  A zombie apocalypse?  It is possible.  With that being said, it is better to be in the know and prepared then not.  Get the book, read the book.  Even if you read it with only entertainment in mind; perhaps when an outbreak does happen, GOD forbid, you might remember something you read in jest. ", "id": "17"}

{"review": "This ASL book is better than most.  I've been looking around to find some books to compliment my beginning sign language class.  Some of the books that i've seen on campus and bookstores have hard to see pictures of the hand formations.  Also some have limited signs, this book has over 5,000 signs and 8,000 illustrations.  This book is not heavy, it has the porous pages that may not be the most durable but at almost 800 pages it's very manageable and no reflecting light.  The paperback is re-enforced so it's easy to bend and scan the pages to get to what you are looking for alphabetically.  Some of those other books categorize the signs like food, family, greetings...this one is A to Z so you know where to find the sign you are looking for.  The U.S.A. list is $24.00.  I won a beat up copy for $10.50 with shipping and satisfied.  Okay you get it I this is a solid purchase.  I have more to say but i'm going to communicate with my hands. ", "id": "21"}
