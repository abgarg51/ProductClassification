{"review": "The new novel Carrots is such a delight to read and should be added to your summer reading list today! From the moment you open the cover and meet Shelby Nichols, you will love being in her world and experiencing things right by her side. Author Colleen Helme has provided us with a quirky, endearing, and at times delightfully frustrating character who finds herself surviving a supermarket shooting, and can then hear what people are thinking when she wakes up. You will love following Shelby get herself into some adventurous and hilarious situations with her newfound talent - you simply will not want to put this book down! This book has everything from mobsters to marital stress, and turns a very average woman's life upside down with her newfound ability to read minds. The writing is fresh, witty and well done, you are never left feeling as if things are dragging on, and I was continuously entertained while reading this book. Well done Colleen Helme, cannot wait for your next creative creation! If it is half as good as Carrots, I'll be reading! Such a treat, I will be gifting copies to my friends soon so we can discuss it soon, because believe me, you will want to connect with someone else who has read it to re-live the well crafted moments of the book.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "This was such a fun book to read!!! Enter Shelby Nichols, your average housewife who goes to the store so she can get some carrots to make some chicken soup for her family for dinner, and with a bang, literally, everything changes. After getting shot in the head, she can read minds. As a scifi fan, I definitely loved the mind-reading bit. I've often wondered if I could have a special ability, what would it be??? After reading this book and seeing all the trouble Shelby's mind-reading gets her into, I don't think I'd want that one. Perhaps her other special ability is being able to avoid being killed. There's a lot more action than perhaps the typical house-wife sees, but perhaps just the right amount that the typical day-dreaming housewife imagines she could be involved in. This could be your neighbor next door. Read it, you'll enjoy it!!!!", "id": "18"}
{"review": "This was a fun story. I would have enjoyed it more if there had been better editing. Things like \"produce isle\", \"pealed out of the parking lot\", \"loosing my mind\", \"who's car is that?\", and \"you should see a councilor\" (that is a lawyer - what she needed to see was counselor) really bugged me and distracted me from the story. I noted 14 of these types of errors. Normally it doesn't bother me that much, but in this case, there were just too many. Too bad, because although it was rather far-fetched, I did like the story a lot. This probably would have been a series I would enjoy, but I don't think I'll be checking out the others.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "I started out with a sample of this book and really enjoyed how it started. I thought the book had such an interesting idea and was excited about the possibilities of where the story would go. After I bought and read the book I became disappointed because, while I realize that you have to suspend disbelief to a degree with fiction, the story just became too outlandish for my tastes. It was a quick read and I'm not too upset about buying the book because the price was so reasonable anyway but after starting out with such an interesting idea the book headed off in a direction that wasn't very interesting to me.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "I wanted something light and entertaining to read, and took advantage of Kindle's lending library to check this book out. Though the idea is interesting - what would happen if you could suddenly read people's thoughts - the concept is weighed down with poor characterization, stereotypical characters and a horrendous lack of editing. It reads as if someone used spell check and decided that was sufficient editing. I got about a third of the way through this book before I gave up. I had no idea who the main character was. Her relationships with her family were barely sketched in, and I have no idea what motivates this character. I was also irritated by her anger at her husband over another woman being interested in him even though he did not reciprocate, while she's being swoony over the police officer. I remember reading a considerable amount of mommy mysteries about a decade ago so it is not as though I object to the genre, but there are much better examples of this particular type available. Light and entertaining doesn't have to mean brainless.", "id": "18"}

I liked the main character, I LOVED Ramos, I'm glad there was a bit of everything: romance, adventure, superpowers, conflict, suspense, and humor.

I liked that she used her new found \"gift\" to mend those relationships. And I must say, the main character had some creative ideas on how to get herself in and out of trouble...I really enjoyed this book.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "One of the main reasons I selected this novel was due, in part, to the cover. People really do judge books by its cover. Having said that, I wasn't that thrilled with the story. But to be fair, I thought this story was going to be a real page turner seeing as how the main character, Shelby Nichols, was on her way to the grocery store to pick up some carrots to make chicken noodle soup for her family. While going down the aisles, she grabs her carrots and gets some other items, takes her basket to the checkout line, and she hears a loud POW! A crazed man with a gun is holding up the bank, and begins shooting all over the place, and instead of Shelby ducking and taking cover like the other patrons did, she stood and watched--out of shock or could that be pure stupidity, whichever you prefer? At any rate, the next thing she remembers is a paramedic over her asking her questions, but she could barely make out what he was saying. She just wanted her carrots, but what was that trickling down her forehead? Blood! What had happened and why couldn't she just go home? Turns out Shelby was grazed by one of the stray bullets by the armed robber, and as luck would have it, or a curse, as some might think, she begins to know exactly what everyone is thinking, even though their mouths aren't moving, but she hears their thoughts. Now, that sounds exciting, right? Well, it was until the story seemed to take on an immaturity level and Shelby just seemed to get dumber as the pages grew. I found myself not liking this character, and I so wanted too. She did things that were just plain stupid, and there were things that happened in different scenarios that didn't seem to add up or there wasn't any rhyme or reason behind it. The story was written well, but I wish the main character wasn't so quirky. This isn't a bad read, I guess it just wasn't for me. If you like a ditzy character, then I'm sure you'll like this book.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "My first by this author, and it initially attracted my attention because it was a freebie. The humor was a little forced in the beginning, but I did laugh out loud twice later in the book. The author skipped all sorts of cliches in the character and thoughts of the husband, which I greatly appreciated. The portraits of some minor characters were more complex than expected, as were some of the genuinely surprising plot twists. I had a hard time believing the heroine was in her mid-thirties and the mother of two older kids; she seemed much younger to me. Actually, she seemed slightly stunted. She didn't know some fairly basic social covenants and had no real moral compass. She also seemed awfully isolated. Yes, she is supposed to be a full time mom, but her kids are pre-teen and young-teen. What does she do why they are in school all day? And why doesn't she have any friends? However, I was engrossed in this story and eager to know how it turned out. Bottom line, I just bought the next book, Fast Money, and am diving right in.", "id": "18"}

{"review": "This book is about 3 families and their struggles during WWII. A Jewish man is mad at God for taking his wife. Two children are traumatized by their mothers death and decision by their Dad to go to war. Adult Penny and her sister were verbally abused by their parents. This book was really hard to read because of the emotional pounding everyone gets for the first half of the book. No bright spots, just emotional beating after beating. It lightens up a little after that, and the last 3 chapters everything was tied up in a tidy bow. Except for the Jewish man, I felt that all of the trauma was too easily overcome and settled. This is not one of Lynn Austin's better books, it was a relief when I finally got to the end.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Over the weekend, I described Lynn Austin's recent book, While We're Far Apart, like an intricate symphony. It begins with a rather straightforward melody: Penny watches as the man she pines for leaves for War on the eve of the American involvement in WWII and offers recklessly to take care of his two motherless children in hopes of securing his love upon his return from duty. Shaking feelings of worthlessness long instilled from her over-bearing parents, Penny steps outside the front door of the house she has always lived in and charges toward a new future. On the eve of his departure, widowed Eddie tries to ignore the pleas of his two young children begging him to stay. They don't want Penny to move into their Brooklyn Apartment and usurp their dead mother's space. They, instead, want their father to stay home from the war. Eddie leaves to converse with Jacob Mendel, his Jewish landlord and another tune strings in. Jacob's wife Miriam and Eddie's wife Rachel were both killed in the same untimely accident. As ramification, Jacob has lost his faith in Hashem ---- God seems so far away although the rabbi and his wife try desperately to tug the former elder back to the life of the synagogue. And then, climactically and with discordance, the local synagogue is prey to an act of arson and a seemingly faraway hatred is brandished like a cymbal- jolt into the present. The tune evokes a haunting change as more instruments are melded into each deft cadence and more bars are added to prolong the unraveling symphony. Dense orchestration including the introduction of new friends; wisps of letters from Jacob's son and his wife in war-torn, Holocaust Hungary, and deep whispers of secrets from loved ones near and far merge to create a seamless piece. There are themes of love and pursuit; of anger, of hatred of a clashing war. Of the brisk touch of this world and the world beyond. It is an almost perfect rendering of a tumultuous time. Austin never writes without an over-arching theme and in While We're Far Apart, the seeming absence of God is most resonant. Jacob followed and meditated on the words of the Torah steadfastly only to find the seams of his world tearing and his life falling apart. Penny isn't sure how to believe in God: when she repeats over and over again all of her shortcomings. Young Esther and her wordless brother Peter go through the motions of a Sunday Schooled upbringing attempting to reconcile the death of their mother with the faith she seemed to inspire in them. All lives collide and cross--- and yet the Almighty seems painfully silent. While We're Far Apart is a magnificent exposition of God in all of his seeming silences. Is He there when we can't hear Him? ---There whether in the materialization of Christian or Jewish tradition? Even amidst a Holocaust recalling the treacherous reign of Haman and the unlikely heroism of Queen Esther? Amidst persecution, death and unwarranted vandalism? How can we pick up the pieces of our faith if we're not sure where faith leads? What is God doing behind the scenes and how are His silences even more telling than His revelation? The end of the song, the end of the book, empowers the reader to think of God in a personal and enraptured way. He can handle our anger and our despair: our lashings out and our pain..... for it is in these moments that we test our faith to breaking point, shirk any complacency and recognize that years later, when the glass is undimmed, that He was there working out the technical aspects, the last strains and chords of melody and sewing together a music so beautiful our human ears could scarce imagine it.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "The novel opens in Brooklyn, New York in the fall of 1943 during WWII. Eddie Schaffer age 33 and his two children, 12-year-old Esther and 9-year-old Peter live in a small apartment upstairs from their landlord, Jacob Mendel. A year prior, Eddie's wife Rachel was killed together with his landlord's wife, Miriam. Eddie is having difficulty coping with Rachel's death and decides to enlist in the army throwing the entire family for a loop. The children had already lost their mother and feared losing their father in battle. Eddie's mother, Grandma Shaffer, lives next door to the Goodrich family who has a daughter Penny, aged 24. Penny's parents are older, quite strict and have sheltered Penny her entire life, always telling her she had no more sense than a green bean. As a result poor Penny suffers from terrible fear of being on her own and afraid of the world at large, although she holds a job as a ticket agent at the local bus station. Unbeknownst to Eddie, Penny has had a crush on him for years and years and always wished Eddie had married her instead of Rachel. She cried her eyes out when she learned Eddie was getting married. Now enlisted in the Army and ready to head off for basic training, Eddie needs someone to care for young Esther and Peter. His own mother, Grandma Shaffer is adamant that there is no way possible she can look after two young children and is completely dead set against Eddie enlisting but Eddie had already enlisted sending Grandma into quite a dramatic tizzy. Penny steps forward and offers to care for the children herself with her underlying motive being that Eddie will fall in love with her and marry HER this time. Soon Penny and children are ensconced in Eddie's apartment, living above Jacob Mendel who is suffering with his own problems. His son, Avraham traveled to Hungary five years ago to study the Torah, met and married Sarah and they had a daughter together whom they named Fredeleh, but now all three of them are missing! Young Esther is struggling in Sunday school asking the teacher why there are wars, why her mother died in the car accident and asks: \"Why doesn't God just kill all the evil people himself\". Her teacher tells the class they should pray for their loved ones who are off fighting in the war but Esther can't accept that as an answer and inquires: \"Even if we pray and pray, God doesn't stop people from dying, so what good does it do\"? How many of us have asked that very same question during our own journey of faith? In the meantime, poor little Peter seems to have lost his ability to talk once his father went off to war and is frightened. He writes a note on his chalkboard for his sister saying: \"I don't know what's wrong. I try to talk and nothing comes out. Help me!\" Esther doesn't know what to do and won't ask Penny for any help as she despises Penny and thinks that she is trying to replace her mother. But Penny, at this point, couldn't be much help as she herself has no self-confidence, always telling herself she can't do things and always makes a mess of everything. These put-downs are old tapes playing in her head that her parents have pounded into her since she was a young child. They continue to treat Penny as a child and make her feel as though everything that happens is her fault. Yet somehow she found the inner strength and courage to move out of her parents home and care for Eddie's children. Downstairs, Jacob Mendel has lost his Jewish faith completely. Esther and Peter visit Mr. Mendel after school each day to help him around the house. Esther begins to seek answers about God, prayer and faith from Mr. Mendel but he doesn't know how to help Esther or what to say to her. He too has lost faith in his religion and his God. He finally explains the story of Joseph and the coat of many colours and tells the children that: \"Faith is believing even when you cannot see it\". But, does Jacob himself still really believe that? Due to Esther's persistence and questions, and Peter's sad eyes, Jacob was beginning to come out from under the veil of darkness and unbelief he had been under for the past year and a half. Jacob decides that he and the children will invite Penny in celebrating \"Purim\", which is the feast of \"Queen Esther\" from the Bible. Keeping with tradition, Jacob tells the children that instead of him telling the story, they will each read the story together with everyone taking a part. Of course, Esther will play the part of Queen Esther and Peter will be Hashem (The Man or God). They will also bake the traditional \"Hamantaschen\" (cookies). During Jacob's planning of the party he realizes he is truly happy. As the relationship between Mr. Mendel, the children and Penny begins to grow, they come to learn together about faith, loss, love, and forgiveness. There are so many other exciting parts in this story that I don't want to give anything else away. But there are a few morals in this story that I believe are important for all of us to remember. We need to remember that God is always there, even when we can't see Him or hear Him. Even when we think our prayers are not being heard, they are, just not always in the way we'd like them to be. It is and has always been God's will that shall be done, not ours! Even during silence and painful hardships, God is still there. Sometimes we must travel through hardships in our lives in order for us to learn something or to understand something. Without hardships we wouldn't be able to grow in our faith. We need to trust God and live our lives as humble servants, even when we cannot see, even when we feel tired of looking and want to give up. God is ALWAYS there, even when He is silent. This is also an important story that talks about the atrocities that were placed upon the people of Jewish faith during the war, in my opinion, one of the saddest and most hurtful of all times in history. Lynn Austin has once again written a riveting story. A story that you'll remember long after the last page has been turned. It's the type of book you'll want to read again and again. This is one story you can't miss!!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Excited by the description and the stellar reviews, I was eager to pick this one up. It was a quick read but in the end lacked the complexity and content that one would expect. I might recommend this book for a mature 6th-grader writing a book report, but as an adult I was disappointed. While the book is clearly character driven (the descriptions of the \"Brooklyn\" setting could have been Anywhere, USA), the characters themselves seemed to be so stereotypical and poorly developed beyond the basics: the struggling middle-class family, the young enthusiastic soldier, the orthodox Jew, the closed-minded bigot, etc. The letters from Hungary, describing the plight of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation, felt mostly like a tool for the author to educate the reader about basic WWII history rather than supplement the story. What was most unappealing was the simplistic nature of the characters and dialogue; essentially boiled down to a young adult level but with the serious overtones of an adult topic. Overall the development of the book was overly thin and predictable, and the ending a little too saccharine for me to swallow. As if real life could be wrapped up in such a neat little bow!", "id": "17"}

I love that the \"Far Apart\" theme was carried out in many ways through the various characters and the fact that Mr. Mendel kept reinforcing the idea that we should stop at nothing to find those we love. The author did a good job developing the characters. I genuinely cared about what happened to them and felt the anguish of Esther as she desperately searched the news for information about the area her father was. Mr. Mendel was probably my favorite character. I felt his heartache throughout the book and loved how he grew as a person throughout the story.", "id": "17"}

So having fun getting authors together and scheduling their mini take overs . Also reading up a storm. Have so many books coming down the pipe. Might have to hook up with some awesome reviewers. So todays book is THE WAYEVIL DOES (the first book in the Eisenbrey trilogy:) By Amara Draska BOOK BLURB Rebecca Reis considers abandoning her career as a novelist until she begins writing about convicted serial killer Thomas Eisenbrey. Nicknamed the Hunter because of his penchant for targeting groups of hunters in the forest, Eisenbrey is the worst kind of psychopath. He is crafty, aloof, at times possessing a charm that is almost hypnotizing, and he’s wheedling his way into her mind. As her interviews with him in the Washington State Penitentiary progress, Rebecca finds herself having feelings for the last man in the world that she should, forcing her to ignore her attraction to the detective who is also vying for her affection. But when the Hunter escapes, she worries—who will he hunt next? MY REVIEW I was so excited when I got this book. It has everything a little bit of romance a hot detective a psychopath killer named THE HUNTER who is rather dashing and charming but also very crafty. He is slowly getting into the mind of Rebecca the reporter sent to interview him. She is sent to the State pen to interview him and as the interviews progress she finds that she is starting to fall for the debonair killer But there is also the very hot detective that also wants her. But she is scared that when the hunter escapes who will he go after and will she live to see another day. The author takes us on a ride that will end up reading all night long. This has a romance, serial killers , murders and a twist of paranormal. The characters are so well written . You feel for them and start to care for them. I must admit I did like Thomas even though he was a serial killer and probably want to stab me to death. He did kind a get under your skin while you read. I didn't think that all the aspects would work but it did. Even the twist of paranormal . It does and trust me you will be drawn into hell and back and yes there is a cliff hanger but not a big of one that will make you scream. This book will keep you up all night reading. Hope you are ready for a big book hangover. So check out this book and check out the great story lines characters and wonderful plots. I promise you will not be disappointed", "id": "18"}

If you're going in anyway, prepare yourself to suspend disbelief beyond the usual for contemporary fiction, because this one has so many plot holes it's ridiculous. The hero promised us partway through that he would get answers on those plot holes, and he failed miserably on keeping that promise. What he revealed as the big secret was something that was obvious from the first couple of chapters. That the \"good old days\" were better is a fallacy to begin with, and so is a poor premise to base a book upon. Don't waste your time.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Wow, based on the reviews and the description of the book, I had high hopes. I was in the mood for something different, so I picked this up for free. That's what it was worth. It was so amateur - a completely telegraphed story-line (I could have written the exact same ending after having read the first few chapters), characters that you could not connect with (because the writer himself made fun of them by giving them stupid names and making them predictable and dumb), and the hillbilly dialogue was annoying.

{"review": "For a first time author, I was very pleasantly surprised. The first two pages had me totally hooked and from then on I was taken on a thrilling ride through not only the far north of New Zealand but the snow-covered central plateau. Matt Cairns has cleverly woven a story of good versus evil. He has used his previous experience as both soldier and policeman to excellent effect and he draws the reader in to a world that few talk about ... experimentation to enhance human strength and abilities. At times this book is scary ... it is also moving and funny. I absolutely enjoyed it and all the characters had depth and were totally believable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure and thriller which borders somewhat on the dark and mysterious. I look forward to more books by this author.", "id": "18"}

For anyone who has traveled the central plateau of New Zealand and stopped in Waiouru to re-fuel, grab a bite to eat, visit the army museum or check for road closures - you will recognise the scenery depicted in Matt's story line. If you are an ex-service person or army brat who lived in Waiouru you will feel at home, recognise the key landmarks Matt describes and through his use of descriptive language be able to picture exactly where the characters are placed. From the Chinese takeaway to the watch house and the road closure gates. I'm not a fan of the genre and wouldn't normally have pursued the book, but Matt kept me interested in the other details that surrounded the cold blooded thriller so i could move through the aspects that I don't enjoy reading about.

I would have liked the author to have had the courage to use the local terms, \"arse\" not \"ass\", \"bonnet and boot\", not \"hood and trunk\", and to have accurately quoted the Met service, who would predict snow to 600 metres, not 600 yards.

One of my favorite parts of the book are the interactive \"homework assignments.\" For each new idea explored, the author has suggestions, questions, and activities for growth for both newbies and existing business owners. Plus it's just plain fun to read. Too many business books take themselves too seriously and are a bit dry, but with chapters and sections like, \" Brain Junk,\" \"The Weirdness,\" and \"The Fire,\" you'll be engaged throughout this entire book.

{"review": "Susan Baroncini-Moe claims that this book is for small business entrepreneurs. That's where she's wrong. I say this book is for small business entrepreneurs AND anyone who is willing to work hard to chase a dream. I'm not starting a business. What I am is a blogger and an indie author, someone with aspirations, and this book is relevant to my needs and what I want to accomplish. Very shortly after I dug into the first chapter, I had to put the book down and run to get a pencil and colored tabs so I could start marking pages and underlining sentences. Even before I finished reading, I had a chance to speak with a friend who is in the beginning stages of starting a web comic, and I couldn't help but recommend this book to her. The author writes in a companionable tone, and the text is divided into brief sections, and when you combine those two factors, you get easy, fast reading. What I usually expect from a business book is stuffy formality, but I got none of that here. Instead, what I got was straightforward information and practical examples, all packaged in conversational-style writing. I've finished reading the book, but I'm nowhere near done with it. Next I get to explore the companion website, and I'm going to go back through the book and take the time to work on the homework assignments that appear throughout the text. There must be something terribly wrong: I'm feeling excited about doing homework. What has Susan done to me?! Whether you're looking into starting a small business or a chasing a dream that needs a lot of elbow grease and focus, this book will be of practical use to you. Trust me: I know a little about dream chasing.", "id": "3"}

{"review": "Title: Business in Blue Jeans Author: Susan Baroncini-Moe Publisher: Sound Wisdom ISBN: 978-1-937879-22-8 \"Small business is, to me, the essence of the American Dream. Entrepreneurship is the backbone of our economy, and it offers virtually anyone unlimited opportunity, income, and freedom. But like anything worth pursuing, it requires effort,\" Susan Baroncini-Moe states in her book, \"Business in Blue Jeans - How to Have a Successful Business on Your Own Terms, in Your Own Style.\" This two hundred and thirty page hardbound book is targeted not only toward one who wants to start up a new business venture, it aids in successful growth of an existing business. With a plethora of positive reviews on the back jacket cover and six pages at the beginning of the book, Baroncini-Moe knows strategies and marketing techniques to start or stay in business. After the introduction, the book is separated into six parts that walks the \"newbie\" or existing business owner through starting or revamping their trade. Stating one has \"brain junk\" that stops him or her from being successful, one needs to work on dealing with negativity to get to the next step in business, drawing the line regarding core values that may include politics or religion. Almost every chapter has homework assignments for both novice and veteran, some with her own tried examples yet there are no easy fill-in-the-blank or self-help tests for guidance. At the end there is a six page index and invitation to join her online website for more information. The author describes in detail the fire inside that is based on motivation and inspiration and how to stroke the embers when the fire wanes. Through expertise and packaging, one can learn how to lean into marketing by village networking. As a fan of meditation, she promotes having a \"dream to reality\" book, an inventory of success and a \" plan of whys\" to facilitate finding a happy medium in business to maintain being true to oneself. Correlating a business owner's progress to a kitchen sink, she concentrates on keeping time journals, knowing explicit target markets, having a ten focus group, and brainstorming with peers. By getting the reader to write out detailed thoughts, dreams, goals and expectations in each chapter regarding his or her business, no doubt one will be more tuned in to its successes, improvements and future direction. With it obviously working well for Baroncini-Moe, one can glean much information that can be applied to a new start up or floundering business that needs energizing.

{"review": "I could get past the spyware app written by a former model. I could get past the texting and insta romance. I could get over the bizarre backstory of Jax getting messed over (out of a stunt contract) by a woman he was dating. I could try and overlook the \"I can't be seen with you\" text from Lexi which should have ended the story (who would want to be with such a mean and flawed woman). What I couldn't get over was the oddly fabricated and ineffective point of tension that was suppose to keep the hero and heroine apart. Romance books are far from believable, and are often meant to offer a total escape. That said, the storyline should make sense and the point of contention that causes drama should have an element of believability. It this case, it made absolutely no sense whatsoever that Lexi couldn't be with Jax, and that any fashion house would shun her dating him (or have a say). Most publicity is good publicity, so it would have actually been a huge plus for the added media attention. I can't recommend Reckless, and it was a book I had to give up on while reading.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Lexi needs a man to mix it up a little. She's all about being in control and having her life and career in order. That is until Miss Perfect meets hot Biker Boy. This is one man who can shake her life up, and rock it hard, too. I loved him from the cover, and I loved him from chapter one. Super fine and sexy, rugged and tatted, Jax is more than that rough-looking bad boy image. He's also one very sweet hero. The kind of man who needs care and wants love really badly, and I love those heroes. I do love me a needy hero. Who can resist a man who's open and ready to love? Jax very much wants a girl who will love and respect him, treat him right, and not walk all over him. Now, don't think he's a wuss. He's not. He's just used to being used, and I felt for him. He's had his share of action, lots of beautiful women, always attracted to their flashy exterior, but now he's going to turn it around and find himself a woman who can be sweet and kind and not use him for gain and ulterior motive. How he meets the heroine is interesting and fun and playful, kind of secret, with some flirty and naughty texts exchanged with a stranger. It also allows him to feel that he's getting to know this woman first and not be distracted by the exterior. For her part, this is exactly what Lexi also wants. She wants to be anonymous, to have a little fun with a hot stranger, all without risking involvement. But you know how that's going to work out! These two are damaged, or jaded, in their own ways, and you know they are perfect for each other. There is a bit of going back and forth, letting doubt creep in and sabotage a good thing. Is Jax's image bad for Lexi's career? Does Lexi want something from Jax, to use him? That sort of thing. And in the end, it's all about taking a risk and letting go; being a little reckless and seeing what happens. I kind of wanted a little more at the ending, which to me felt just a bit rushed. I think sometimes authors maybe underestimate the appeal of an epilogue, and I'm definitely one of those readers who likes an extra kiss there at the end. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this romance and this author, a lot. Loved the hero! Thought Jax was so sweet and fine, rough-edged but vulnerable. The romance is sweet, and the sex scenes are hot, erotic and detailed. This couple sparked the page, and it was arousing to read. I liked the secondary characters, too, all interesting and adding to the story, with Rubi being a true scene-stealer, and I can't wait for her story.

{"review": "What happens when Hollywood's bad boy in hiding meets little miss prim and proper? Hotness. Hotness happens. Lots-and-lots of hotness. Reckless is the first book in Skye Jordan's Renegades series and was unputdownable. Be warned, you will not want to put aside Jax and Lexie's story for anything. I had things to do yesterday, most of which did not get done simply because \"one more chapter\" turned into another, which turned into another, and so on. Not only was Reckless a smokin' hot read, but both Lexie and Jax were very engaging characters with issues they needed to overcome to make their relationship work. Jax (who happened to give me a major case of the swoons) is an actor turned stunt man who has been screwed over one too many times. He has trust issues out the yin yang and certainly isn't looking for more than a roll in the hay. Did I mention Jax is beyond smexy and quite the dirty talker? \"We've got all night to explore the many different kinds of orgasms that exist. And no, baby, they're not all the same.\" Lexie is a haute couture dress designer who hasn't had a vacation day in years. On her flight to the biggest business meeting of her life, she sees Jax. He's everything she wants but nothing she needs. She can't stop thinking about him so using a bad ass app her friend, Rubie, designed, she contacts him anonymously. Sparks fly between them and I fell in lust. Lexie knows Jax is no good for her and could do damage to her career but what would one night with him really do? Reckless was off the charts hot and I fell hard for Jax. *fans self* A lot of time in contemporary romance I'll find myself liking but not loving both of the main characters; that wasn't the case here. Jax and Lexie were both fantastic, had a great plot to work with, and I loved them together. Honestly I was a bit sad when the book ended as I wanted more; more of them and more of the world. Luckily Renegades is a series and Reckless was just the beginning so I'll get more of the super smexy world Skye Jordan created. I'm hoping book two is about Rubie and Wes as they had some serious sparkage. *ARC PROVIDED BY CYGNET BOOKS VIA NETGALLEY*", "id": "17"}

{"review": "Be careful with this one, it's sure to melt your e-reader...not to mention your heart. Lexi LaCroix controls every aspect of her life - from her painstakingly detailed wedding gown designs to her love life. She's pulled herself from the dirt poor place she grew up in to one of the most sought after wedding apparel designers in the country. Now, more than ever, she must be careful about her actions. She's under intense scrutiny due to a possible lucrative partnership with Martina Galliano - the woman who can make all of Lexi's dreams come true. Unfortunately, the stress and pressure has finally gotten to Lexi. As owner and designer, she often puts in 14+ hour days stitching and mending her designs by hand. With the gain in notoriety, her drive to be the best and attain her dreams has burned her out. Now, with the most important deal of her life in the works, she's running out of designs...and inspiration. Jax Chamberlain. --Hang on, let me say it again. Jax Chamberlain.-- Former actor turned stuntman, Jax is used to women using him to get what they want. An audition, an introduction, an investment. He's been burned too many times and is quite simply done with sex-on-heels women who use him for connections to the entertainment industry. When Lexi sees Jax while leaving L.A. for New York - and is presented with an app that allows her to see the phone numbers of those around her - she does something reckless and anonymously texts him. The texts turn quickly from curious to flirtatious to smoldering. LEXI: What kind of sex do you like? JAX: I like the fiery, fast sex so passionate your vision blurs. JAX: I like wild, frantic, have-to-have-you sex that burns you alive. JAX: I like deep, driving sex where sweat drips off my chin, rolls down your spine, and tickles the dip between your *** cheeks. JAX: I like secret sex in naughty places, and naughty places to have secret sex. JAX: I like the kind of sex that includes sliding my tongue into all your very tight spaces. JAX: I like any kind of sex that drives animalistic sounds from your throat. Lexi must decide if she's willing to put her job on the line for what promises to be the wildest, most daring fling of her life. A one night affair does little to dim the attraction between them. Is Jax willing to let go and trust a woman who may just be using him? Can Lexi take a chance on a Hollyword bad boy? Whooo, boy Reckless took me completely off guard. I was not expecting anything extraordinary, I'd never read anything by the author before so I was shocked to find how much I enjoyed Reckless. Skye Jordan is obviously a talented writer and has earned her place as one of my go-to authors. Most engaging about the story, if we're going to get down and dirty, is the sex. I had to read this book twice because it was that good. Jax brought everything a man is supposed to bring to the table. He stripped Lexi of her control and in return allowed her to take back control of her career. He was sweet, passionate, and was the perfect dirty talker. *sah-woon* Then he eased the need by pushing his hand low. She gasped in surprise and excitement. At the feel of having a man's hand between her legs. A real man. The kind of man who made her hot and wet and needy. The kind of man who wasn't afraid to take charge or give real pleasure. When they meet again, both begin to drop their guards. Their connection and attraction is too strong to deny. Jax fears that his reputations will damage Lexi's chances at securing the partnership, so even though he's grown to care for her, he tries to let her go. --I loved him in this moment. He doesn't want her to suffer at the hands of the paparazzi and the vicious rumor mill, so he let her go. I loved his point of view. I don't know what it is about being inside a man's head, but it always makes a novel so great to me. Perhaps because I am able to understand their motivations and actions so much more. Either way, Jordan did a great job at writing Jax. I'm still salivating. I'm also excited to learn that this is a series. I can guarantee, based on the description, that the next book will be just as spectacularly crafted as the first.

{"review": "3.5 stars So let us just say that the book was just okay. We loved Jax Chamberlin and just thought that Skye Jordan could have done so much more with his character than Lexi. Jax Chamberlin, ex-actor, undercover wealthy, now movie stunt man is HOT and possibly every woman's dream. But he has been used by the best of them...wanting a role in a movie, to be introduced to the next big star, or just a little cash to tide them over. Jax is tired of being used and he is avoiding women all together. Meanwhile, Lexi is trying to find her way in the fashion world. She is making killer couture dresses for a hefty price, but she is ready to take her career to the next level. Taking her career to the next level could mean no time for fun and definitely no time for a man like Jax Chamberlin. Truthfully, Lexi thinks that Jax's image is all wrong for her career. And that pissed us off that she would judge him by his appearance and job description. Snob much Lexi!!! Well the story does have its good moments - you know Lexi caves in to Jax's sex appeal. And we loved the way he turned her out. Go Jax - Go Jax - Go Jax! 'He groaned, his hands moving over her like he couldn't touch her fast enough. His mouth eating at her mouth like he couldn't get enough of her taste. He pressed her against a wall, but she couldn't remember moving from the middle of the living room. His hips sank deep between her legs, and a fierce shot of pleasure arched her back. She broke the kiss on a moan.' Bayyybeee can you say Jax was putting it on her. So what didn't we like about it...well it may have been a little too much talk about the fashion world. Like really we didn't care about fabric or her making dresses...and we didn't need it to understand the chemistry between her and Jax. And a lot of scenes with Lexi made the story kind of boring. But Lexi had a kick a%& best friend, Rubi. Why is it that the best friend is always the carefree, fun person? It is settled we only want to be the sideline best friend and not the spotlight. LOL! Hell it was Rubi's great invention that got Lexi and Jax together in the first place. We will say that Lexi redeemed herself at the end...what she planned at her fashion show was so very sweet!

{"review": "I'm not always in the mood for romances, but when I am, I'm very picky. I want them to make sense, I want the characters to be likeable and believable, I want a story I can sink my teeth into, and above all, I want (of course) a happy ending. When I first picked up \"A Soft Place to Fall,\" it did not hold my interest. Try as I might, I could not get past the first chapter. But something kept me from putting it away permanently, and a few days ago, I was drawn to it again. This time, I was hooked. I'm not sure what put me off the first time, but this time around, I loved the story, the characters, the writing--everything. Basically, the plot revolves around two lost souls. Annie Galloway, everybody's vision of a perfect bride, and a perfect wife in a perfect marriage, has lost her perfect husband when she is only in her 30s. Only she knows the truth behind the facade of her seemingly fairy-tale life, and she cannot reveal it to anybody. Her grieving mother-in-law, Claudia, looks to her as a remnant of her lost son. Her friends and family continue the myth. So Annie finds herself a cottage in her home town of Shelter Rock Cove, Maine, and tries to pick up the pieces of her ruined life. All of her dreams, of happiness, of motherhood, of everything--seem gone forever. She is a shell, but a strong shell, if that makes any sense. Close by lives newly arrived Sam Butler, back home after a high-flying career in New York. Only he knows the terrible secret that haunts him and threatens his peace and security. He is in no better shape emotionally than Annie. Sam and Annie meet, and, in the way of most romance novels, sparks fly. But this book is written with intelligence and dignity. They do not eye one another and then jump into bed. A great deal of hurt is contained in each of these people, and as in real life, each is afraid to reveal that hurt or to risk another one. When they finally do fall in love, they do not live happily ever after. Reality intrudes. Big-time. How they solve their very real and very overwhelming problems while trying to save their budding relationship is the core of this wonderful story. I loved every word of it. And yes (sigh), it does have a happy ending.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "When his much younger friend asked wealthy Warren Bancroft for a place to hide for a while, he arranges for investor Sam Butler to stay at Shelter Rock Cove, Maine. Warren also manipulated the staying at a nearby beach cottage of Annie Galloway. The widow struggles to regain her life ever since her spouse Kevin died leaving her with quite a debt and a loss of innocence. Warren loves Sam and Annie and hopes by bringing these two deserving people together, a loving match will form. However, Kevin's mother Claudia refuses to allow Annie to move on feeling that would be an affront to the memory of her cherished son. She believes Sam cheated Annie with their real estate deal and is still interfering with her former daughter-in-law. As Sam and Annie begin to fall in love, Claudia is like a ghost from the past reminding Annie that Kevin was forever. Barbara Bretton has written a powerful relationship drama loaded with angst and emotion as the past and the future clash within Annie with the catalyst being the key secondary characters causing the skirmishes that tear at her gut. The story line provides the audience with a poignant character study as readers travel deep into the souls of the lead couple and the support cast.

Each of them is so bound by family responsibility that they overlook one very important thing--their own happiness. This is a love story that is dying to be told. It is a love story that is destined to happen. And although the plot is fairly predictable at the climax, the reader cannot possibly stop reading to find out if these two wonderful, loving people can outrun their pasts and actually find their own happiness. It is a beautifully written romance. Hearts will thump during the romantic encounters. Tears will flow at the end. Then the urge to reread will immediately begin. A joyous book for romance lovers.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "This is the 2nd book I have read by this author. I liked the first one so much (At Last) I wanted to read another. Again the author delivered a nice romantic novel although this has a bit more in the way of explicit sex scenes which turns me off in a romance novel...the plot was not as good as At Last in my opinion. The characters come alive on the page. I liked the fact that the characters were a bit complex and you got to understand them, a little at a time, through the circumstances they go through. What the book does lack is depth to the story. With some attention to detail, this author could be a well known romance writer, instead of one who appears to be churning out books without taking the time to make sure the book is really ready to go to print. What was a disappointment with this book as well as the last book I read was editing issues. Typos...at least 13 of them (At Last was even worse for typos). These books were published quite some time ago, the author has had plenty of time to correct typos in them...but apparently doesn't care that her work is not flawless as more well known authors books are. That is what separates \"the men from the boys\" and separates great writers from mediocre ones. Writers need to take enough pride in their books to make sure they are published without glaring errors (and the errors I found were glaring, not just misplaced punctuation marks, which I did not keep track of but were also there). I had never heard of this author before her free offering of \"At Last\"...but with books that are consistently flawed, I can understand why. Books that lack good editing have \"amateur\" written all over them... I liked the book, although it was a pretty typical romance, which can sometimes get boring...how many different ways can you tell the story of \"boy meets girl, there are issues to overcome, but they get beyond it and live happily ever after...\" The book was OK...nothing special about the plot, but a nice read for a change of pace from some of the other genres I read. I certainly could not read book after book like this, it would get too boring.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "The story line was good but not thought out well enough. There was to much switching from character to character. While a story needs supporting characters this book didn't have a nice flow to it. Every time the writer switched away from the main characters I cringed saying not again. Even found myself scrolling through to find out just how long it was going to be this time before the story went back to them. I would liked to have seen more conversation and interaction between the people the story is about instead of what every other character thought and did. So basically this couples story is troubled pasts love at first site have sex repeatedly get pregnant clear up past stay together. Now you don't need to read the book since you don't get many other details except for their respective pasts somewhat of how things are cleared up and what all the supporting characters think.

In the end, there wasn't much of a conclusion for the problems in Sam's background. This was just another thing that was glossed over.

{"review": "R.P. Dahlke grew up living the crop-dusting life in Modesto, California in the San Joaquin Valley. Her father owned and operated his own Aero Ag business for over thirty years. Today, her son has taken up the torch and flies crop-dusters in the same area. Dahlke is glad to write about it ... but not live it. She currently lives in Tucson, Arizona where she writes her very popular novels. She is a member of Sisters in Crime (the first president of the Cochise County chapter as well as the National chapter), Mystery Writers of America, The Society of Southwestern Authors, and the first president of the Cochise County Chapter of Sisters in Crime. She has six books to her credit, of which this is the fourth in the series of the Dead Red Mysteries. And so we meet up with our favorite heroine Lalla Bains, tall, blond and beautiful ex-model turned crop-duster from Modesto, California all the way in Wishbone, Arizona: `I wasn't supposed to be in Wishbone, Arizona, fearfully scouring the desert for my missing father. I was supposed to be on my honeymoon, married at last to my sweetie, Sheriff Caleb Stone.' That is the manner in which Dahlke has mastered the mystery genre - twists and turns with a huge dollop of humor and fun despite the evil derring-do of her encountered characters. Lalla finds her father in a mine pit atop a corpse who happens to be the local police chief. And as always with Dahlke's stories other coincidental deaths occur - this time a young woman artist - and Lalla is convinced the two murders are connected. The altar deserting Caleb arrives (much to Lalla's consternation) and ends up assisting Lalla in the investigation of the two murders. This is enough of a synopsis to lead any reader (especially if already a RP Dahlke fan) to grab this speedy read and escape reality for Dahlke's far more preposterous and entertaining world. Dahlke is a polished storyteller, having that innate sense of the need for humor inserted into her mysteries that helps not only propel them along, but also keeps our attention during the rest stops. And while producing suspense about a very complicated crime she lets her story breathe with relationships - family, friends, loves - that allows us to build faith in the somewhat quirky character of Lalla Bains, a trait that practically guarantees that readers will follow the other books in this Dead Red Mysteries series. This is a very strong, immensely satisfying, idiosyncratic and entertaining mystery novel. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 14", "id": "18"}
{"review": "Did you know snakes hate mothballs? That's not the only bit of information I gleaned from Rebecca Dahlke's latest novel A Dead Red Alibi. I haven't read any of her other books, but immediately took a liking to her tough as nails heroine, Lalla. The long term patrons of Roxanne's Truck Café have had a couple of pools going on whether and when Lalla would wed her long term partner in crime Sheriff Caleb Stone, as she is wedlock shy, having tried it many times. Finally naming the day, when the prospective bridegroom is an hour and a half late, his bride has fled,. Opting out of Modesto California as her Dad has sold the Aero-Ag business and intends raising milking goats, (and I can't say I blame her)our heroine lights out of Modesto California to a property in Arizona with an outside latrine and coyotes. A wedding present from Auntie Mae. You have to wonder whether she has Lalla's best interests at heart. Dad falls down a mine shaft where he is keeping company with a corpse, who turns out to be the Sheriff of Wishbone, where they now reside. Suffice to say our gal has a talent for solving crimes. Nothing daunted, Caleb turns up and the hunt for a killer is on. This is the beginning of the story, so you can see you're in for an Abu Dahbi Desert Challenge car rally read. And you get it as they uncover a drug trafficking ring. I'm not one for spoiling a reader's enjoyment of a book by detailing the story. The author produces another cracking good yarn for her fans.

In the case of the fourth book in the series, Lalla Bains, stood up at the altar by Sheriff Caleb Stone, runs to inherited property in southeastern Arizona. When her father falls into an abandoned mine, on top of another lawman who happens to be dead, the story is off and running with a lot of unexpected turns and an unhealthy number of suspects.

On a trip to Arizona, Lalla’s dad stumbles into trouble, literally when he falls into a mine shaft occupied by a recently dead body, the local sheriff. Lalla and her cousin, the Lady Smith packing Pearlie take on the challenge of finding the killers in their usual outrageous style. The new location, Wishbone aka Bisbee in Southern Arizona presents interesting scenery and options for characters. The story is fast paced and well written to present multiple options to keep the readers guessing “who done it”.

{"review": "From the first sentence of this fourth installment of the Dead Red series, author R.P. Dahlke had me hooked. “Except for a lank rope and ancient boards loosely sheltering a dark hole, my dad's brand new four-wheel-drive Jeep sat coolly detached and totally unconcerned that its driver was nowhere around.” Of course I wanted to know just what might be in that hole and how this unfortunate soul came to be there. As with all R.P. Dahlke mysteries, she begins by throwing out an enticing rope. Not once have I been able to refuse grabbing onto it, and I’ve been rewarded with a fantastic ride each and every time. There is something most intriguing about a well written series, and R.P. Dahlke has created just that. With her debut novel, A Dead Red Cadillac, she introduced a host of characters that held tremendous appeal. In each novel since, the main players have grown increasingly more captivating. The ones who have been added or subtracted, (this is a mystery series after all and not everyone makes it,) have been many things. They’ve been deceitful, playful, funny, evil, intelligent, dim-witted and crafty, but never have they been boring. You never know what kind of character you may be introduced to in a R.P. Dahlke novel, but you can be darn sure that whoever shows up will be successful in keeping you well entertained. A Dead Red Alibi is my favorite of the series so far. The mystery is a solid one. There were a few times I thought I had it figured out, but Dahlke’s a pro. She’s gifted when it comes to weaving an exciting tale and knows well how to leave crumbs for her readers to follow. She’s clever with her clues and even better with her ability to surprise. This was a fun read with an enormously satisfying ending that will have you shaking your head, laughing out loud and wondering why all books don’t wrap up so creatively. I hope this author is busy right now at her computer. I can’t wait for book number five.", "id": "18"}

Since I’m new to the series—happily I have several books to catch up on—I didn’t realize she’d moved the setting to Southeast Arizona, an area I know well. Here again, Dahlke is able to capture the essence of the place through a few well-chosen phrases.

{"review": "I thoroughly enjoyed Playing with Poison. What a wonderful debut! Jessie Hewitt, protagonist, historical romance writer, and pool shark, is a delight. She is funny, smart and very loyal to her friends. Jessie is in the middle of working on her latest book when she answers a knock on her door. Her neighbor's fiancé, Stanley, stumbles in, collapses on her couch, and dies. So begins a really fun read. Naturally, Jessie immediately becomes a `person of interest' so she feels compelled to investigate. Eventually, Candy (friendly neighbor, lingerie seller, and Stanley's fiancée), is arrested for the murder. Jessie is convinced she is innocent and sets out to prove it. Ms. Blackburn has written a very engaging story. She has filled her book with a great group of characters. Since most of these characters have a good reason for wanting Stanley dead, it isn't easy to figure out the identity of the culprit. I was hooked before I finished reading the first page--actually, it was the first sentence that pulled me in. Being of a certain age, or as Candy puts it, old, that sentence had me nodding my head and chuckling. Throughout the book, Jessie gives us a sneak peek into her work-in-progress, which enhanced the story and made me laugh. This is a well-written story with humor, believable dialogue, extremely likeable characters, and just the right amount of romance--everything I love in a story! I've just downloaded the next two books in this series: Double Shot and Three Odd Balls. Looking forward to reading them. Can't wait to see what Ms. Blackburn has in store for Jessie and her friends.

I love Jessie's clever, sarcastic repartee with Wilson and anyone else she chooses to dish it out to! The town of Clarence has a cozy feel to it as does The Stone Fountain, and sounds like a place I would like to retire. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the bar room pool games and Jessie's `real job' writer's block trials and tribulations of the Harlequin romance-like heroine, Alexis Wynsome and her knight in shining armor, Rolfe Vanderhorn. These passages are written with such exaggerated verbiage that I could almost hear Jessie laughing to herself that her loyal following is so hinged on reading her next book. A fun `chick-lit' book in that Jessie is someone to whom many women `of a certain age' can relate - a menopausal divorcee, generally content with her life/livelihood, surrounded by good friends whose collective quirkiness constitute a family, yet someone who still believes in love, Prince Charming and the living happily ever after fairytale ending.", "id": "17"}

It's not humorous (and I write humor columns), and I don't know what a \"cozy mystery\" is unless a herd of kittens kills somebody. It starts with a neighbor's boyfriend falling dead on a the principal character's couch. Without due process or a coroner's report, by page five the lead detective has declared it to be murder by poison and then harasses everyone from the main character (a successful writer of all things) to all of the writer's friends and acquaintances. Everybody's upset, but not so upset that they can't go have dinner and drinks, feeling mildly harassed but not uncomfortable. By the second chapter, all the suspects and are sitting around complaining what an ogre the lead detective is. There's so much dialogue and so little thought that I struggled to go on for three more chapters. It will make a very successful bad TV series, \"CSI Des Moines\" (with apologies to Des Moines).

Jessie sets out to clear her name by finding out who the real killer is, and why, even though she's been told she does not need to be sleuthing around. Jessie's sleuthing is balanced with her writing her latest romance novel. It's interesting to see that little story developing within the story as well. Detective Wilson Rye tells Jessie at one point that he is 90% sure she is innocent, and that gets her fired up. :) She is investigating all their friends, her ex-husband, the company the deceased worked for, and more.

{"review": "I read this book in two days flat and I know that, had I had the time, I would have read it in one sitting. This is a book that grips you, draws you in and leaves you feeling a slightly better person for having read it. The story is that of Louie Zamperini - a track and field star of the 1930's, who participated in the Berlin olympics, was part of the US air force in WWII, was shot down over the ocean, was adrift in the Pacific for over a month, was held as a POW by the Japanese forces and finally made it back to his life and has had the courage to live it to its fullest. Hillenbrand is a marvellous author. I was never tempted to read Seabiscuit and this was my first introduction to her work. She is one of a few authors who can write a non fiction story in the most gripping and vivid way imaginable. Instead of being flowery or overly embellished her prose relies squarely on research and on witness accounts and yet manages to never be dull. The swiftly moving story takes the reader from Zamperini's early beginnings, his swift rise to track star, the Berlin olympics and then to the World War. This is where the story really blooms. Hillenbrand settles in for the long haul here and we get to see the air force and the B24 bombers through the words of the men who actually flew them. The sequences where Zamperini and his friend Phil are adrift at sea are vivid and strangely beautifully described. The horrors that await them at the Japanese prison camps are not glossed over but neither does Hillenbrand wallow in the gore and violence as some authors may be tempted to do. There is always a strong sense of the respect the author holds for the men whose story she is being allowed to tell. History has perhaps focused its eye too exclusively on the war in Europe to the extent where the situation in the Pacific and the plight of POW's there has not recieved the attention and the respect it deserves. Hillenbrand's book and detailed research certainly makes a strong attempt to change that. Solidly based on statistics and army reports from both sides of the war, Hillenbrands book paints a clear picture of the hellish conditions that the POW's endured and the utter madness of the war that was being waged in the Pacific. This is a hard story to read but one that is well worth it. The falling apart of Louie's life and his slow path to regaining his life and sense of purpose is a story that is truly inspiring. This book will find a permanent place of honor on my bookshelf.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Louis Zamperini? Who is he? Laura Hillenbrand's near 500-page reply will answer the question not only once, but for all. He is the California boy who was a kleptomaniac. He is the running prodigy who competed at Hitler's Berlin Olympics, shook hands with the Fuhrer, and was almost shot by Nazi guards for stealing a Nazi souvenir. He is the American serviceman who entered the Pacific theater, crashed into the sea, and spent a harrowing forty-odd days floating on a disintegrating raft circled by aggressive sharks, scorched by a relentless sun, and gnawed to the bone by an inescapable hunger. Who is Louis Zamperini? He is a man who overcame all THAT only to be \"rescued\" by the wrong side -- the Japanese. He is the man who went from being a prisoner of starvation and sharks that actually leaped up and tried to snatch him out of the foundering raft to being a prisoner of Japanese guards who were every bit as predatory as the great white of the seas. He is the man who was beaten every day by a particular Japanese corporal named Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a.k.a. \"the Bird.\" He is, in short, the Unbroken One -- the man who kept getting up, coming back, rebounding, and holding on to the tenuous thread that connected him with life and hope, past any duration that any of us could possibly imagine. And, as YOU can imagine, his story is compelling. In fact, in the capable hands of Laura Hillenbrand, author of SEABISCUIT, it reads like a thriller, a page-turner, a fictional product of a keenly talented mind -- proving once again that truth can trump fiction when it comes to stories and mankind's love of hearing them. When you reach the end of this man's incredible journey, you will be awed by the scope of Hillenbrand's writing. It is clear that she did a vast amount of research -- reading letters, telegrams, newspaper clippings, radio transcripts, etc., AND interviewing not only Zamperini himself, but his family members, friends, surviving fellow servicemen, and even Japanese captors. Woven in her biography are many statistics and facts from the history of World War II as well. You will learn about the science of survival -- why certain men live and certain men die -- and about the strengths and weaknesses of America's planes that carried servicemen over the vast distances of the Pacific Ocean. You will learn about the war strategy, the Japanese culture and its effects on treatment of POWs as well as on conducting (and refusing to surrender in) a war to the bitter end. And, sadly, you will learn about the aftermath of war in Japan. It's all here, bigger than life, packed into the small frame of one man from Torrance, California -- a man that could, and did, live to tell about a page in history we hope never to repeat. Both a personal tale of redemption and resilience, UNBROKEN is destined to become a classic in the category of narrative nonfiction. Ordinarily I'm a fiction guy, but I was spellbound from the start. Honest. Give it a try. It's big, but reads small. I think, when you reach the end, you, too, will sing its (and Louie's) praises (at 93, Zamperini is still alive and still \"Unbroken\"!).", "id": "2"}
{"review": "No one can accuse Laura Hillenbrand, author of Seabiscuit: An American Legend, of ever doing a half-effort job of research when she writes narrative nonfiction. Spending seven years on this effort, the Author has produced one of the most detailed stories of an American POW being held by the Japanese during World War II that I have ever read. With the many interviews with the subject during her research, along with interviews of family members, other POW's and their families, reading over unpublished memoirs, personal letters, and military documents, it would have been easy for this book to have become a long drawn-out and sterile narrative that would read like a text book. Instead we're treated to a captivating and at times heart-wrenching story that takes a group of unknowns and present them in a way that you truly come to know them. The subject of the book is Louis Zamperini, whose life would have been an interesting read even before the events during WWII. A relatively trouble child who stole everything in sight, he grows up to become one of the greatest track stars of his time, shattering the national high school record in the mile and becoming one of the youngest members of the U.S. Olympic team in 1936. Many felt that Zamperini would become the first person to break the four minute mile. With the onset of the war, he was drafted into the Army Air Force and became a bombardier assigned to the semi-unreliable B-24. After surviving a number of bombing missions against Japanese targets his plane goes down in the middle of the ocean while searching for another downed plane. What follows is a story of survival by sheer will, first being adrift at sea for 46 days and then spending over two brutal years as a POW in Japan. Hillenbrand takes us step-by-step through the events, introducing us to other Allied prisoners as well as a number of the Japanese guards and personnel. Her descriptions of the brutality Louie, as well as other prisoners, went through are very detailed and heart-wrenching. His daily beatings from a guard known as \"The Bird\" would have been enough to break anyone but Zamperini endured each one. One thing I found interesting is not only did she name names of the guards that tortured the prisoners mercilessly she also did not shy away from pointing out the Japanese personnel who did their best to shield the prisoners even at the risk of their own safety. Then after the war the Author takes us through the post-traumatic years as Zamperini's life spirals downward, and his eventual rebirth as he learns forgiveness and peace. I would highly recommend this to those looking for an inspiring story of, as the sub-title of the book says, \"Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.\" Just be aware, a large portion of the story will focus on the brutality and suffering inflicted on the POW's by the Japanese war machine. It can be at times a very disturbing and difficult narrative to read, one that can bring tears to your eyes. It is both one of the best books of the WWII POW experience I've read, and one of the most troubling.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is the long (500 pages) extremely detailed, meticulously researched and extremely moving story of a Hero. And yes, the caps on \"hero\" was intentional. In the first half of the book we get a detailed biography of Louis Zamperini- bad boy, then track and field star and Olympic contender. Possibly too detailed here, I admit. We then segue into WWI and Lt Zamperini's Air Corps career as a B-24 bombardier. Great stuff here, goes into fascinating detail about the B24 Liberator and the men who flew them in the Pacific. The last portion here is a harrowing tale of survival in the open seas, one of the best I have read. Then, Louie Zamperini gets captured by the Japanese. Folks, watching Bridge on the River Kwai will not prepare you for the brutality and inhumanity of the horrors Laura Hillenbrand brings to life here. Now, this is a gripping adventure story, well told, one that is hard to put down. But I had to put this book down in a couple places here, the story was that brutally true. A tale of unbelievable endurance, hardship and heroism. A real page turner, extremely well written and readable.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "In \"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption,\" author Laura Hillenbrand (of Seabiscuit: An American Legend tells the story of Louis Zamperini, a bad boy turned track and field star, who participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympic and even met Hitler. Narrowly escaping arrest for attempting to piler a Nazi flag, Zamperini returned home, washed out as a pilot and eventually ended up in the Army Air Corps as a B-24 bombardier. Then, in May 1943, his plane goes down. He and one of his crewmates endure over 47 days before they find land, but, unfortunately, they land in enemy terrain, and are sent to a POW camp, where the story gets even more harrowing and brutal. The story of Zamperini's ordeal, survival and eventual return home, with its own attendant struggles, is one of the most gripping tales of heroism and sheer toughness, mental and physical, that I have ever read. I must admit, I was a bit worried that Ms. Hillenbrand, after having written the excellent Seabiscuit, would suffer a \"sophomore slump.\" My worries were completely unfounded. Ms. Hillenbrand has the rare gift for setting atmosphere, including vast amounts of tightly-integrated background information, yet her narrative never drags or slows. Every detail was meticulously researched - I can only imagine how much work that took - and she did an incredible effort of setting the stage. I also appreciated the even-handedness of her approach, particularly when singling out the kind and humane guards in the Japanese POW camp, who took tremendous risks. Another standout section of the book, although brief, was the difficulty soldiers had in returning back to \"normal life\" after the war. This is one of the best books, historical or not, that I have ever read, and would make an outstanding movie as well. Five-plus stars.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I remember quite clearly when reading Laura Hillenbrand's \"Seabiscuit\" about the famous racehorse that this might be a once-in-a-lifetime book for the author, that she would probably never find so compelling a story to focus upon. Hillenbrand herself says much the same thing in the afterword to her new \"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption\" (due to be released to the public in the next couple weeks) -- but then she learned about Louie Zamperini. Zamperini, as the son of immigrant Italians in California in the 1930s, seemed a sure candidate for everybody's \"Most Likely to Go to Reform School\" list. Then, his older brother convinced him to try out for the high school track team, and a great natural gift for running was discovered. In short order, his academic and disciplinary record reversed itself, and soon Zamperini was a student at USC and one of the brightest stars of the American track scene, often touted as being the man most likely to break the fabled four minute barrier in running the mile. He was on the US team at the 1936 (Berlin) Olympics where he did respectably, although it was believed that with a little more maturity his real opportunity to win gold would come at the 1940 (Tokyo) Olympics. Then, World War II started. Louis Zamperini found himself a B24 bombadier in the Pacific, where long distance over-water flying in aircraft of dubious mechanical reliability probably killed more air crew than combat. In 1943 Zamperini's plane disappeared while on a search-and-rescue mission, and Zamperini and the rest of the crew were presumed killed. Instead, he and the pilot survived 47 days in a life raft before being found and \"rescued\" by the Japanese, landing Zamperini in a succession of POW camps for the next two years. It was a horrid, brutal experience, and it makes for intensely distressing reading. Zamperini was singled out by one particular chief guard, perhaps because of his sports fame, perhaps because of his unbowed attitude, for unrelenting, sadistic attention. Yet, despite the beatings and torture and almost nonexistent food and terrible living conditions Zamperini survived. Restored to the States after the end of the War, Zamperini married but quickly descended into a desperate spiral of alcohol and anger that threatened his marriage and his life. But, improbably enough, when he was dragged reluctantly to a Billy Graham camp meeting by his estranged wife, Zamperini found it within himself to let go of his wholly understandable anger and thirst for revenge, and literally reformed himself overnight, becoming an inspirational speaker and advocate for troubled youths. As of this writing, he is still hale and hearty, an indomitable optimist. Hillenbrand has once again found herself a perfect subject (Zamperini told her that it would be easier to write about him than Seabiscuit because he, at least, could talk), and again has demonstrated her skill in constructing a highly compelling story, vividly drawing upon the memories of a large cast of friends and family and former enemies. \"Unbroken\" is a marvelous book. The account of Zamperini's POW years is tough stuff, to be sure, but Hillenbrand's focus on an extraordinary character is unwavering.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "There are thousands of books written about World War Two. Some tell the story of battles; some follow the history of the whole war, or this or that theater. Some focus on the plight of the Prisoners of War. Some are memoirs, or biographies. Unbroken must join the bibliography of the Pacific War as one of the best personal narratives written. Laura Hillenbrand, famous for her story of Seabiscuit, picks up the story of one young man, Louie Zamperini, troublemaker, runner, bombardier, and runs with it. He was lost in the crash at sea of his B24 Green Hornet. Lost at sea, he drifted for weeks in a life raft with two of his crewmates. They broke all records for survival in such a craft. Two of them made it, through shark infested waters, hunger and thirst to land. That's where their ordeal began. Now, a survival against nature story turns into something more terrible and ominous. Zamperini must contend and deal with the blackest shadows of human nature while a POW in wartime Japan. Against all odds he survives, after being officially declared dead and returns to a grateful nation. He and his fellow POWs suffer the after effects of their ordeals for years after the war and again, Zamperini sinks into his own private hell. Then, when in deepest despair, he meets a young Billy Graham and his life turns around once more. He finds finally redemption and returns to Japan not as a messenger of hate but as a herald of hope and forgiveness. I loved this book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is likely to be the book of the year for several reasons. It is beautifully written and beautifully structured. It has a compelling and inspirational subject. It is filled to the brim with fascinating facts (Which parts of a shark are edible? What was the mortality rate in Japanese prison camps versus that in Italian/German ones? What is it like to fly a B-24?). It is the product of exhaustive research. It combines the advantages and attractiveness of biography with the strengths and strategies of suspense fiction. By now, most will be familiar with the subject. In Seabiscuit Laura Hillenbrand studied a California racer. She does the same in Unbroken, with the distinct advantage that (as her subject pointed out to her) he can actually talk and tell her what happened. Her subject, Louie Zamperini, was a difficult child who matured into an Olympic runner, racing in Berlin in 1936. He joined the Army Air Force in WWII, serving as a bombardier. His hideously-unreliable B-24 plummeted into the Pacific and he and two fellow fliers floated in an open raft toward the Marshall Islands, fighting heat, thirst, starvation, sharks and strafings from a Japanese plane along the way. Interned in several Japanese prison camps he was treated mercilessly and criminally. Saved by the American forces in the Pacific, the relentless bombing of Japan by B-29's and, quintessentially, by the flight of the Enola Gay, he was freed and returned home. Enslaved by persistent memories and alcohol, his marriage on the edge, he was saved by none other than Billy Graham. He remains alive today at 93, still feisty and active. This is the perfect Christmas gift for anyone, but particularly for those who remember the war, those who experienced it directly and those who need to be educated concerning it. Be warned, however. Once they start reading the book they will be absent from the rest of the family's holiday activities until they complete it. I highly recommend it and tip my hat to the author for her personal courage and tenacity in writing a great book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Laura Hillenbrand's new book, \"Unbroken\", is one of the most incredible books I've read in recent years. It is the true story of Louie Zamperini. Zamperini, an Olympic 5000 meter runner for the US(Berlin; 1936) survives the plane crash of his bomber in the Pacific in May of 1943. The book recounts in vivid detail all that occurs over the next 2 and 1/2 years. Mr. Zamperini's story is absolutely incredible. This ranks with the best personal accounts of WWII ever written. This book is riveting!! Ms Hillenbrand's narrative style compels you to continue turning pages long after her accounts of the horrors Zamperini has endured have left you exhausted. This book is a MUST READ!! It is destined to be perched at the top of the bestseller lists for months to come.", "id": "2"}

I see high school kids everyday who can't go 5 minutes without texting, they need to have Starbucks every morning, a Red Bull with lunch. Adversity to them is having their phone taken away. Every little thing is drama to them. We modify everything. No Child Can Be Left Behind. If something is too tough or challenging, we modify and make it easier. Any time a student has something bad happen to them or even something bad to somebody that they just know of, we send it grief specialists and crisis teams...for any bit of adversity.

This book and more importantly the story, the writing is great, but man what a story. There is not much I can see, every American should read this book. The next time you are upset because you lose your WiFi connection, or the line is too long at Starbucks, think of what Louis and 1,000's of others of his generation went through.

{"review": "With this introductory novel was published in 1997, few would have predicted the unprecedented success this series would produce. And everything that made Harry Potter so successful is all first shown, though hardly fully explained, in this book, HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSPHER'S STONE. The novel opens with Harry living under the cupboard with his abusive aunt and uncle. He has had a mean, depressed life, and though an active boy, the sheer amount of trauma he must have endured would scar any child. But the door opens out of this lifestyle. I've read an interesting theory (obviously not true), that a much different writer than Rowling would have ended Book 7 with Harry having imagined all this fantasy world, where he was so prominent and famous, to help escape the neglect and abuse from the Dursleys. He gets a letter (actually, hundreds) saying he is in fact a wizard. So he is enrolled the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Him, along with his new friend the giant Hagrid, go to Diagon Alley, a magical bazaar, and thus he is thrust into the magical universe so captured the imagination of millions. We soon learn Harry is world famous among wizards for conquering an evil Wizard named Vo - um - He Who Must Not Be Named. Sorry `bout that slip. =). Along the way, we learn that Voldemort is after a magical artifiact called the Philosopher's Stone (which was, unfortunately, changed from the UK original title to \"Sorcerer's Stone\" in all other regions). So much of the novel is driven by the three main characters defending this stone from Voldemort. In this novel we get the first ever glimpses of Hogwarts, Voldemort, Quidditch, Dumbledore, Severus Snape, muggles, the Forbidden Forest, the Invisibility Cloak, and any other number of thins Rowling's magical confectionary of an imagination has cooked up for us. One of the best things about this book, and indeed about the whole series, is how Rowling plants details which, when reading, you may not necessarily pick up on, but are later rather important in later volumes. Who would think Griphook and Hagrid's admonition no one breaks into Gringotts would have such prominence in Book 7? Or the importance of Harry being able to talk to the boa constrictor, something which is not referenced again until Book 2 and then not fully explained until Book 7? Or the Invisibility Cloak, a device first introduced in this novel, but you have no idea of its importance, or even that it has real significane, until Book 7. Another great example of this planting of clues is Neville Longbottom, who, but by fate, could easily have been the main star of the series, though you don't find out that information until much later in Book 5. The book also introduces the relationship dynamics that would continue throughout the entire series, from the interplay between the three main kids (Harry, Ron, and Hermione), to the ambiguous Severus Snape, the wise mentor figure of Albus Dumbledore, bumbling Hagrid with his love of nasty creatures, prim and reserved Professor McGonagall, evil incarnate Voldemort, Draco Malfoy, etc. Overall, there are numerous memorable scenes in this novel. As the novels progressed, the children aged and the target audience would have aged as well. In this novel, they are still very young and immature, but already at this early point in their career, there are seeds of greatness for Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The same can be said of this debut novel as well. This is my order of Potter books by preference: Deathly Hallows Prisoner of Azkaban Order of the Phoenix Philosopher's Stone/Chamber of Secrets (I rank them both the same) Half-Blood Prince Goblet of Fire.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "What a wonderful book! I read it after my 11-year old son suggested it as a change from my usual reading fare of history and biography.

I was quickly captivated by Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermoine, and yes, even the nasty Dursleys, Snape, and Draco Mafoy. Hogwarts came to life for me. I found myself unable to put the book down because it was so exciting and much fun to read! It's easy to understand why my son (and so many kids just like him) love Harry Potter so much. J.K.

Oh, there's the illustration of Harry drawn by Rowling, but that's not really worth this cost. I found the book to be rather too flashy, gaudy even, and much prefer the simplicity of the UK special editions (which, by the way, cost half as much as this book and that includes the cost for shipping). Please know that I don't mind spending money on good editions of books I already have. The fact that I own 6 copies of Lord of the Rings will attest to this. But, I just am not excited about this pricey collector's edition. So, instead of purchasing this book, I would recommend popping over to Amazon UK and getting TWO of *those* special editions (keep in mind when you're looking that the original title of Sorcerer's Stone is Philosopher's Stone), because, really, part of the joy of collecting is that you will have something unique and rare.

{"review": "Granted, I lack the basic criterion for being an expert on children's book--I'm 26 years old. For old times' sake, I do try to stay current on what's new in children's book. Compared to almost everything else I've read, Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter series stands far ahead of the pack. Ms. Rowling takes a classic scenario in British children's literature--adolescent children going to boarding school--and turns it on its head. Usually, all of the exciting stuff happens during school holidays (as in C.S. Lewis' \"Chronicles of Narnia\" or Enid Blyton's \"Five\" and \"Seven\" series). In Harry Potter's world, school holidays are spent among the \"Muggles\"--the non-magical world--while school is where the magic really happens. And magic there is! From the wizardly sport of Quidditch to classes in potions to a three-headed dog named Fluffy, Ms. Rowling throws in enough magic to keep the interest of children (and adults) who don't usually like reading. A sparkling plot, realistic (if you can imagine a magical world, then these people belong in it) characters and a fully-realized world combine to create a true gem of children's literature. This one can easily share a shelf with \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and even \"The Hobbit\". Don't miss Harry Potter and his adventures!", "id": "4"}

In this case, what your thirty bucks buys is -- apart from the previously published text (the novel itself) and the previously published art (interior art) -- is, essentially, a new cover by longtime Harry Potter cover artist Mary GrandPre, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling (quite the cartoonist!), which comprises the \"bonus\" material Scholastic has been touting but keeping under wraps. The wraps are off and, while the illustration is nice, Scholastic would be better off issuing either an illustration edition with more art (which, by the way, exists), or taking the momentous occasion of the 10th anniversary to celebrate it in a significant fashion: Rowling, why wasn't there an original interview in which you looked back at the ten years of Harry Potter in the media? Why wasn't there a long essay by a respected literary critic looking at the Harry Potter phenomenon? Why wasn't there MORE text? If this was simply a reprint edition, the omission of new text would be understandable. But when you're celebrating ten years of Harry Potter in print, how, exactly, does a new cover, a previously published (to the best of my knowledge) illustration for the colored endpapers, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling \"celebrate\" the book's publication? As there is no historical retrospective here, I'd have to say that Scholastic missed the boat: This edition could have been so much more, but it suffers (ironically) from a failure of imagination. I have rated it five stars because the first novel is a literary classic in the children's field. The publisher, however, needs to think about how to ADD VALUE to the existing edition when touting its \"anniversary\" status, esp. if they intend on reissuing matching volumes in the future. Otherwise, it comes off as being just another edition to get the fans' hard-earned money, instead of offering something new, different, and significantly improved.", "id": "4"}

So, instead of purchasing this book, I would recommend popping over to Amazon UK and getting TWO of *those* special editions (keep in mind when you're looking that the original title of Sorcerer's Stone is Philosopher's Stone), because, really, part of the joy of collecting is that you will have something unique and rare. How many kids on your block have the unedited UK editions of this great story?", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Granted, I lack the basic criterion for being an expert on children's book--I'm 26 years old. For old times' sake, I do try to stay current on what's new in children's book. Compared to almost everything else I've read, Ms. Rowling's Harry Potter series stands far ahead of the pack. Ms. Rowling takes a classic scenario in British children's literature--adolescent children going to boarding school--and turns it on its head. Usually, all of the exciting stuff happens during school holidays (as in C.S. Lewis' \"Chronicles of Narnia\" or Enid Blyton's \"Five\" and \"Seven\" series). In Harry Potter's world, school holidays are spent among the \"Muggles\"--the non-magical world--while school is where the magic really happens. And magic there is! From the wizardly sport of Quidditch to classes in potions to a three-headed dog named Fluffy, Ms. Rowling throws in enough magic to keep the interest of children (and adults) who don't usually like reading. A sparkling plot, realistic (if you can imagine a magical world, then these people belong in it) characters and a fully-realized world combine to create a true gem of children's literature. This one can easily share a shelf with \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and even \"The Hobbit\". Don't miss Harry Potter and his adventures!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Harry Potter has lived a dismal life with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. He sleeps in a closet and has never had a birthday party or Christmas presents. Even worse, he has to endure life with his horrible spoiled cousin, Dudley. Then on Harry's eleventh birthday, things change when a letter arrives, (by owl), inviting him to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Suddenly Harry finds himself among friends, learning about potion-making and magic-wand waving and broomstick riding. There're chocolate frogs and Every Flavor Beans and a three-headed dog and Quidditch-a game better than soccer. Also, Hagrid, a lovable gamekeeper who befriends Harry; Hermione Granger, a witch who's read all the school books and knows all the rules; and there's Ron Weasly, Harry's best friend who has quite a legacy of his own to fill. Hogwarts treats him well, even with the abomidable Malfoy's mean tricks or Professor Snape's obvious hatred of Harry. The soon Harry finds himself in the middle of a mystery at Hogwarts, and together with his two new friends, embarks on adventures he never dreamed possible. The book is engaging with its imagery, humor, plot twists and real-life child problems. The book doesn't only appeal to children but adults as well. She's a master on fantasy. She really can, with no difficulty at all, think herself back to 11 years old. You will love the whimsical descriptions, humorous quotes and the fun characters.", "id": "17"}

However, having seen the Harry Potter books on the best seller lists for months, I finally purchased Sorcerer's Stone. I could not put the book down. While the plots and storylines are not complicated, they are completely captivating. Cover to cover the book is entertaining. I always thought that a wizard's land (Hogwarts in this case) would be a perfect idealistic place; when in fact it is full of good and evil, much like our real world. This thought captivates me as I begin Book 2. I found the Sorcerer's Stone enchanting; much like I felt when I read the Tolkien Trilogy.

{"review": "In today's economy, customers buying books need to know exactly what they're buying. In this case, what your thirty bucks buys is -- apart from the previously published text (the novel itself) and the previously published art (interior art) -- is, essentially, a new cover by longtime Harry Potter cover artist Mary GrandPre, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling (quite the cartoonist!), which comprises the \"bonus\" material Scholastic has been touting but keeping under wraps. The wraps are off and, while the illustration is nice, Scholastic would be better off issuing either an illustration edition with more art (which, by the way, exists), or taking the momentous occasion of the 10th anniversary to celebrate it in a significant fashion: Rowling, why wasn't there an original interview in which you looked back at the ten years of Harry Potter in the media? Why wasn't there a long essay by a respected literary critic looking at the Harry Potter phenomenon? Why wasn't there MORE text? If this was simply a reprint edition, the omission of new text would be understandable. But when you're celebrating ten years of Harry Potter in print, how, exactly, does a new cover, a previously published (to the best of my knowledge) illustration for the colored endpapers, and a black-and-white illustration by Rowling \"celebrate\" the book's publication? As there is no historical retrospective here, I'd have to say that Scholastic missed the boat: This edition could have been so much more, but it suffers (ironically) from a failure of imagination. I have rated it five stars because the first novel is a literary classic in the children's field. The publisher, however, needs to think about how to ADD VALUE to the existing edition when touting its \"anniversary\" status, esp. if they intend on reissuing matching volumes in the future. Otherwise, it comes off as being just another edition to get the fans' hard-earned money, instead of offering something new, different, and significantly improved.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "A few months ago I joined the Thomas Nelson Publishers blog book review team. What a novel idea. I signed up, agreed to write a review and publish it on my blog as well as one other commercial site. In exchange, I received the book I chose to review in the mail. I chose \"Jesus Calling,\" a devotional by Sarah Young. I was drawn to the content based on a few tweets from others reading the devotional. I grew up in my faith with the Oswald Chambers classic \"My Utmost for His Highest.\" I love my online devotional time on the Jesuit site [..]--one of my favourite experiences on the web. I also love Henri Nouwen's \"Bread for the Journey.\" Now \"Jesus Calling\" is fast becoming another classic in my life. Sarah Young writes what she hears Jesus speaking to her in her spirit. She has honed her listening through years and years of writing in her journal and being attentive to what the Spirit wants to say to her. As I have spent time in \"Jesus Calling, \"I have heard Jesus speaking to me many times in beautiful, fresh ways. Sometimes I hear Sarah's personal filter--she is the pen, the messenger, after all--but I also recognize this as the voice of my Shepherd. Here are a few of my favourite calls: * \"Rest in My Presence, allowing Me to take charge of this day. Do not bolt into the day like a racehorse suddenly released. Instead, walk purposefully with Me, letting Me direct your course one step at a time.\" * \"You are on the right path. Listen more to Me, and less to your doubts. I am leading you along the way designed just for you.\" * \"You must discipline yourself to live within the boundaries of today. It is in the present moment that I walk close to you, helping you carry your burdens. Keep your focus on My Presence in the present.\" I definitely recommend \"Jesus Calling.\" My only caveat comes with the actual design. Here's what I suggest: Please don't judge this book by its cover. I was surprised when I opened the parcel I received in the mail. I was actually somewhat taken aback. My heart sank somewhat, because this book came dressed as a very dated, and forgive me for this, missionary. You get the picture. I had to force myself to pass through the visual barrier. The size and design also visually placed it in the gift book category, which surprised me. I am in my thirties and I have never bought a Christian gift book. That's just me. As I dove into the content, however, wanting to keep up my end of the agreement, I was drawn in by the fresh writing. This book has taken me new places with Jesus. There's a lot of wisdom here, so much Beauty and great Depth. \"Jesus Calling\" is worth laying down all your preconceived ideas about where you might receive and delving deeply into this revelation of Jesus. So, while the design placed this book for me in a different audience; the content of this book crosses generations for those who want to experience Jesus in a fresh way. If you can pierce through the visual barrier of the book jacket, the content will grab your heart, because it is Jesus speaking though one of his beloved daughters.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "\"Jesus Calling\" is a relatively unique devotional book in that Sarah Young has written her devotions from the point of view of Jesus Christ. Using this technique gives the book a sense of immediacy and intimacy with the Lord, and this is the great strength of the book. Many of these short sayings that Young puts in the mouth of Jesus are things the Lord would say and has said to me during a life of listening to Him, reading the Scriptures, and keeping a journal. How often have I heard Him remind me to worship Him alone, to trust in Him at all times, and that He is always with me. To hear these words as if they are Jesus' own can be beneficial to the soul. However, there are 4 reasons I can give \"Jesus Calling\" only 3 stars and not 4 or 5 stars, (even though I'm vastly outnumbered in the reviews on Amazon). 1. Young has Jesus say only a limited range of things compared to what God actually teaches in the entirety of the Bible. I love to hear Jesus say things like, \"Relax; Trust Me; Listen to Me; I am with you; I am calling you; and Wait for Me.\" But this seems to be all that Young's Jesus ever says. Where are the specific commandments of Jesus, and not just \"affirmations\"? Where does this Jesus ever talk about the practical ways we should love our neighbor, and not just love God? And why is it always a solitary call to be alone with Him, when we're called to be the Church? 2. \"Jesus Calling\" shows Young's bias and doesn't have Jesus say the hard things He must often say. Where are His reminders and commandments to seek forgiveness and to forgive, to love regardless of the cost, etc? This Jesus doesn't seem ask us to do anything difficult or to sacrifice very much. It's all \"You are on the right path.\" Where are the times when Jesus has to chastise, correct, and discipline us? Where are the times when He says things like, \"Repent!\" or \"You're being too selfish and must take up your cross for Me today.\"? 3. \"Jesus Calling\" doesn't give any hint that sometimes God may withdraw His sweet fruit from our lives so we will depend only on Him, and not on His gifts. The saints have often experienced the \"dark night of the soul\" when we can't always feel God's blessed Presence? What then? Young's devotional doesn't account for this. 4. The devotionals are not directly scriptural. Thankfully, these devotionals aren't heretical or unsound: they're just incomplete. It's true that there are some Scripture references tacked on at the end of each devotional, but I don't sense that the whole counsel of God comes through in these devotionals. I like what God has told Young, but sometimes it's all too easy to interpret your own voice as being that of the Lord's. Occasionally, the words presented as Jesus' are jarring and don't sound like Jesus, such as: \"This is a paradigm shift that will revolutionize your life\" (devotional for March 22). \"Jesus Calling\" has undoubtedly blessed many lives and will continue to do so. However, it gives a narrow view of the entirety of what Jesus Christ has to say to us.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "This book, written as if God were speaking, gives you a new perspective on God's desire for you to find contentment and peace. Sarah Young finds the perfect scriptural references for each devotion. Reading this devotion daily will bring you a new kind of peace, rooted in the word of God.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "Sarah Young's Jesus Calling should be very troubling to biblical Christians. 1) It emulates God Calling: “During that same year [1992], I began reading God Calling, a devotional book written by two anonymous “listeners”. These women practiced waiting quietly in God’s Presence, pencils and paper in hand, recording the messages they received from Him…this little paperback became a treasure to me.” There are definitely denials of Christian theology in God Calling. Here are some examples: “I, who could command a universe – I await the commands of My children.” “I am actually at the center of every man’s being, but distracted with the things of the sense-life, he finds Me not.” (This is “Panentheism” – the belief that every part of the universe exists in God, rather than God being above and independent from His creation.) “If you realize your high privilege, you have only to think and immediately the object of your thought is called into being.” (Similar to Word of Faith doctrine) “You are very privileged, both of you. I share My plans and secrets with you and make known to you My Purposes, while so many have to grope on.” (Gnosticism) “How often mortals rush to earthly friends who can serve them in so limited a way, when the friends who are freed from the limitations of humanity can serve them so much better, understand better, protect better, plan better, and even plead better their cause with Me.” (Spiritualism) “I and my Father are one. One in desire to do good.” (Denial of the deity of Christ.) Why does Sarah Young, who has evangelical, biblical credentials, tout God Calling as a “treasure”? And not only that, but she emulates the two listeners: “The following year I began to wonder if I, too, could receive messages during my times of communing with God…I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more. Increasingly, I wanted to hear what God had to say to me personally on a given day. I decided to listen to God with pen in hand, writing down whatever I believed He was saying.” Why did Sarah Young yearn for more? 2 Timothy 3:16 says, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” The Word of God is sufficient. Everything He needs to say to us is included in the Bible! 2) Sarah Young herself promotes New Age/Eastern concepts. There’s no doubt she’s read the writings of New Age writers: Visualization: Sarah also describes on page x of the introduction how she practiced visualization. She says, “One morning as I prayed, I visualized God protecting each of us. I pictured first our daughter, then our son, and then Steve encircled by God’s protective Presence, which looked like golden light. When I prayed for myself, I was suddenly enveloped in brilliant light and profound peace.” Visualization is a practice of the occult and it is widely promoted in the contemplative/mystical movement. Nowhere does Scripture teach us to pray via visualization, which is really an attempt to change reality with the mind. New Age terms/concepts spouted by “Jesus” in Jesus Calling: divine alchemy, co-creation with God, practicing the Presence, “be a channel”, “make your mind like a still pool of water, ready to receive whatever thoughts I drop into it”, quantum leap, paradigm shift, “I am above all, as well as in all”, consciousness, sacred space of communion, “breathe slowly and deeply”, still your mind. I believe that Sarah Young has been especially influenced by Barbara Marx Hubbard, author of The Revelation, a New Age re-write of portions of the Bible. Hubbard writes that her Jesus says we should “create the cocoon of light”, and Sarah Young’s Jesus says: “I am all around you, like a cocoon of light.” 3) Sarah states that her writings must be subservient to the Bible, but she doesn’t tell us what they are or if we are to regard them as authoritative. Interestingly, she claims that the messages are “…whatever I believed He was saying”, but adds, “I have continued to receive personal messages from God…” So which is it? Actual messages from God or what she believes are messages from God? We must ask ourselves three questions: a) Do the messages just restate the Word of God? Then they are unnecessary. b) Do they contradict the Word of God? Then they are heretical. c) Do they add to the Scripture? Then she is implying that the Scripture is inadequate for our spiritual needs. We must never sacrifice obedience to God's Word for emotional experiences. Be alert to deception, for we are all weak and vulnerable to Satan's wiles.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "There are several problems with this book. Here are just four: -The obvious one is that the book puts words in God's mouth. -The author seems to depend on mystic experiences she's had for her belief in God. Also, she wants something more than God's Word in the Bible. It has a New Age feel to it. -It's a feel good book. It avoids the real problem of personal sin. It's all about God filling the personal needs that you feel. It's very self-centered. -Dependence on experiences will lead to frustration and confusion in the Christian life because we need to have more and more experiences to be satisfied. In a nutshell, the book is misleading and is self-centered, rather than what Christianity teaches- to realize our sinfulness and look to Christ, and to serve God and others as a response to our salvation. I do not recommend this book.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "I initially gave Sarah Young's \"Jesus Calling\" a great review, mostly because I had never encountered a devotional that had Jesus speak directly to the reader. At first, this concept was intriguing to me. As a born again Christian, however, I have become increasingly convicted when I pick up this book. Why? Because the words written on each page are not Jesus' words, but are portrayed that way. Even though the author *may* have felt Jesus saying these things to *her*, how are we to know for sure? The only words that I trust as Jesus spoken words are directly from the Bible. I don't feel comfortable reading this book anymore. It feels like heresy. I feel the same way about the final \"Left Behind\" books that write in dialogue from Jesus. I don't think anyone should put words into our Savior's mouth. As a Christian, be wary of trusting any words attributed to Christ that aren't in the Bible.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "I had no knowledge of either the book or the author when I began reading Sarah Young's Jesus Calling (having been asked by some of the readers of this site to do so). I had seen the book as a fixture on the Christian bestselling lists, but had never taken a look at it. The first thing I learned is that it has over 450 reviews on Amazon where it is holding down a 5-star average, something that is no small accomplishment. I downloaded it to my Kindle and began to read. Sarah Young is the wife of a third-generation missionary to Japan who has earned post-graduate degrees from Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, a Presbyterian seminary. Her book is a devotional, a year's worth of short reflections on the Christian faith. But it has one major, all-important twist. I will review the book under 2 headings: What She Says About What She Says and then What She Says. In other words, the first part will discuss the foundation of what she says and the second part will look at the actual content of the devotionals. What She Says About What She Says This is a book about experiencing the Presence of God (Presence is always capitalized in the book). It is about growing closer in relationship to the Lord, something every Christian craves. Young uses Presence to describe a very tangible feeling of God's presence. Here is some background, the first time she encountered this Presence: One night I found myself leaving the warmth of our cozy chalet to walk alone in the snowy mountains. I went into a deeply wooded area, feeling vulnerable and awed by cold, moonlit beauty. The air was crisp and dry, piercing to inhale. Suddenly I felt as if a warm mist enveloped me. I became aware of a lovely Presence, and my involuntary response was to whisper, `Sweet Jesus.' This utterance was totally uncharacteristic of me, and I was shocked to hear myself speaking so tenderly to Jesus. As I pondered this brief communication, I realized it was the response of a converted heart; at that moment I knew I belonged to Him. This was far more than the intellectual answers for which I'd been searching. This was a relationship with the Creator of the universe. Influenced by authors such as Catherine Marshall and Andrew Murray, Young continued to pursue this Presence of God, seeking to learn how to continually feel or sense God's presence. She grew in her love for God and grew in her desire to spend time with him, speaking to him in prayer and hearing from him through the Word. It was in 1992 that she received a copy of God Calling, \"a devotional book written by two anonymous `listeners.' These women practiced waiting quietly in God's Presence, pencils and paper in hand, recording the messages they received from Him. The messages are written in the first person, with `I' designating God.\" This book became a treasure and a textbook. Young continues, The following year, I began to wonder if I, too, could receive messages during my times of communing with God. I had been writing in prayer journals for years, but that was one-way communication: I did all the talking. I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more. Increasingly, I wanted to hear what God had to say to me personally on a given day. I decided to listen to God with pen in hand, writing down whatever I believe He was saying. I felt awkward the first time I tried this, but I received a message. It was short, biblical, and appropriate. It addressed topics that were current in my life: trust, fear, and closeness to God. I responded by writing in my prayer journal. You will not be surprised to learn that the content of this book, each of the devotionals, is a message Young has received from the Lord--a message meant to provide a deeper experience of Jesus' Presence and Peace. \"This practice of listening to God has increased my intimacy with Him more than any other spiritual discipline, so I want to share some of the messages I have received. In many parts of the world, Christians seem to be searching for a deeper experience of Jesus' Presence and Peace. The messages that follow address that felt need.\" We cannot miss this. As I have spoken to others about the book, I've heard some people say that this book is written as if Jesus is speaking to the reader. But it's important to know that Young makes a far more audacious claim--this is Jesus speaking, through her. The messages he has given her, she now passes on to us. This is a very good time to pause and consider this claim. Sarah is claiming some kind of new revelation from God. She is saying that God speaks to her and that she then passes these messages to others. Immediately we need to ask what she believes about the Bible. Is she claiming that these messages are equal to Scripture? That they trump Scripture? She makes no such claim; not directly, anyway. At one point she says, \"I knew these writings were not inspired as Scripture is, but they were helping me grow closer to God.\" Later she says \"The Bible is, of course, the only inerrant [without error] Word of God; my writings must be consistent with that unchanging standard.\" But this is all she says. While she clarifies that her writings must be subservient to the Bible, she does not actually tell us what they are or how we are to regard them. Are they authoritative? Are they in any way binding on her or on us? If they are not inspired and not inerrant, what exactly are they? There are no answers forthcoming because immediately Young begins to share those words of God as daily devotionals, saying \"I have continued to receive personal messages from God as I meditate on Him. The more difficult my life circumstances, the more I need these encouraging directives from my Creator.\" James Montgomery Boice once said that the real battle in our times would not be the inerrancy or infallibility of Scripture, but its sufficiency--are we going to rely on the Bible or will we continually long for other revelation? In Jesus Calling we see this so clearly. Young teaches that though the Bible is inerrant and infallible, it is insufficient. It was not enough for her and, implicitly, she teaches that it cannot be enough for us. After all, it was not reading Scripture that proved her most important spiritual discipline, but this listening, this receiving of messages from the Lord. It is not Scripture she brings to us, not primarily anyway, but these messages from Jesus. On this basis alone this book is very suspect and needs to be treated with the utmost care. Young offers us words that she insists come straight from the Lord. But she gives no proof that we should expect the Lord to speak to us this way; all she offers is her own experience of it. At this point we are left with a few options. We can stop reading altogether, we can continue to read while rejecting her claims that these are words from the Lord, or we can read and take her at her word. Personally, unless reviewing the book, I would abandon it immediately. If she claims to be speaking Jesus' words, I am no longer interested. However, for the sake of reviewing it, I continued to read. What She Says Young offers a years' worth of devotionals, all of which are written in the first person, as messages from Jesus. Each of them is followed with a few Scripture passages. Here is the first half of the devotional for January 8: Softly I announce my Presence. Shimmering hues of radiance tap gently at your consciousness, seeking entrance. Though I have all Power in heaven and on earth, I am infinitely tender with you. The weaker you are, the more gently I approach you. Let your weakness be a door to My Presence. Whenever you feel inadequate, remember that I am your ever-present Help. It is interesting that the majority of the devotionals are affirmations rather than commandments which means that the book tends to be more descriptive than prescriptive. It is less about Jesus telling how we are to live, but more about who he is, who we are, and how to enjoy his Presence. It is notable that these affirmations span only a very narrow range of the Christian experience. It is equally notable that many of Jesus' words sound very little like what he says in the Bible. For example, \"Let the Light of My Presence soak into you, as you focus your thoughts on Me.\" And shortly after, \"Learn to hide in the secret of My Presence, even as you carry out your duties in the world.\" I do not even know what that means or how it might be applied. There is no clear command there for me to obey and no clear word about who Jesus is. Conclusion Jesus Calling is, in its own way, a very dangerous book. Though the theology is largely sound enough, my great concern is that it teaches that hearing words directly from Jesus and then sharing these words with others is the normal Christian experience. In fact, it elevates this experience over all others. And this is a dangerous precedent to set. I see no reason that I would ever recommend this book.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "A couple months ago I was given this devotional book: Jesus Calling, and although I never read devotionals I began to examine the book. What I found shocked me. The author, Sarah Young, claims to have received revelations from Jesus through dialogue journaling (something she learned from two \"listeners\" who wrote another book called God Calling. I'll get to that in a minute). Her book is even written as if Jesus is speaking those messages directly to the reader, which I personally think borders (or crosses into) blasphemy. Alarm bells began to clang in my head. Young writes that a year after reading that book, God Calling, \"I began to wonder if I, too, could receive messages during my times of communing with God. I had been writing in prayer journals for years, but that was one-way communication: I did all the talking. I knew that God communicated with me through the Bible, but I yearned for more...\" The first question that I think needs to be asked. Is it Biblically appropriate to desire more revelation from God? 2 Timothy 3: 13-17 gives a warning about false teaching as well as an admonition to hold to the scriptures which were given to us by God: \"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.\" If we can be \"thoroughly furnished unto all good works,\" then the scriptures are sufficient for our relationship with Christ. We should study them diligently and be transformed by \"the renewing of our minds.\" We should certainly yearn for more understanding of the scriptures, and more transformation of our hearts and lives, but I see no biblical admonitions to yearn for more than the Bible. Additionally, Acts 20:20 states: \"You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.\" The reformers called relying on scriptures solely as the authority for the Christian faith (and sufficient for the faith) the principle of Sola Scriptura. Equip.org offers a very full and rich explanation of Sola Scriptura (I recommend you read it!), but for the sake of brevity they define sufficiency of scripture as \"all that is necessary for faith and practice.\" It was one of the key principles of protestantism. It is obvious Young does not hold to that doctrine. Rather she seeks and accepts experiential, subjective and by the sound of it, mystical, personal revelation. It is my view that abandonment of the sufficiency of the Bible opens us up to all kinds of deception (self-deception as well as demonic deception). The Bible even warns us that our hearts are \"deceitful\" in the book of Jeremiah. The Bible proclaims itself to be authoritative, whereas experiences are entirely subjective. If extra-biblical revelation is acceptable then how can it be verified? Occult-like Practices Young claims in her book that her one-way journaling became \"dialogue\" (two-way conversation) with Jesus. Yet, she admits that her journaling was \"not inspired as Scripture is,\" but still she writes each daily devotional as if Jesus was speaking those words Young heard. This is completely illogical. If Jesus was in fact speaking to Young, then his words would have to be authoritative because Jesus is God. There is no way for him not to be authoritative. In another of her books she writes, \"My first devotional book, Jesus Calling grew out of writings gleaned from my times of focused concentration of Jesus: waiting in His Presence, listening in my mind for His communications. As I listened and wrote, I continually asked for the Holy Spirit's help ... I wrote Dear Jesus in the same listening-to-God mode that I used with Jesus Calling. I've continued to write with the help of Christs's Spirit, who guides my thinking while I listen in His Presence. I believe the Bible is the only infallible Word of God. My writings are based on that absolute standard, and I try to ensure they are consistent with Scripture.\" This is a root problem of personal revelation -- you cannot know for certain that the internal voice you are hearing is God, yourself or from the devil. So she purports to write what Jesus told her, but she had to vet those words to \"ensure they are consistent with Scripture.\" I have a better idea. Study the actual words of God that have already been given to us. I'm sure there is plenty more in the Bible to challenge, convict, teach and change each and every believer for the rest of their life on earth even without whispers in your mind. In my view, waiting and listening for the voice of God is a recipe for deception.", "id": "12290"}

After reading the fourth, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Finished it in less than three days; I couldn't put it down!), I have to let it be know that Ms. Rowling does not disappoint. As every preceding Potter book starts off, the newest is no different: Harry is staying with his insufferable relatives, the Dursleys. And as always, he has found a new, more creative and exciting means of shortening his summer stay with his Aunt, Uncle, and cousin. Trouble invariably manages to find Harry, even at his seemingly secure refuge. Lord Volde-- oh, goodness, excuse me!-- he-who-must-not-be-named is at his strongest, and Harry is facing greater risk than ever before. This is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, and he is now fourteen years old. So along with life-threatening situations, almost losing a best friend, meeting new foes, dealing with old ones- namely Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and managing to get most of his homework done, Potter must also deal with the anguish and misery of being a teenager. Take it from me, I'm seventeen years old, and it's hard for me to believe that J.K. Rowling hasn't just experienced the cruelty of peers and at the same time, the exciting prospects that come with the whole \"Being a Teen\" package. Fearing that I might give too much away, I'll leave you with this tidbit: You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll learn how to pronounce Hermione, but most importantly, you'll want to read more, and become a better person because of it.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I had read the first 3 novels In the Harry Potter series and had found them extremely enjoyable page turners, Rowling creates a complete, magical world and her characters are always perfectly developed: You cheer when Harry stands up to Snape, You scowl inside when Malfoy turns up and you feel safe and secure when Dumbledore's around. But quite simply, the extrodinary and sensational \"Harry Potter and the Goblet Of Fire\" leaves the previous books In the dust. From the opening chapter you realise this Isn't going to be your average Harry Potter book, a character suspected of murder Is himself murdered at the hands of Lord Voldemort. I had always felt a Harry potter novel didn't get exciting until the story reached Hogwarts, this time Harry, Ron and Hermione travel to see a Qudditch World Cup which doesen't leave you dosing off waiting for the Hogwarts Express. But from then on the pace becomes consistently quicker, Harry's name Is put In a \"Goblet Of Fire\" which chooses contestants for a tournament involving other schools of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry is helped throughout the tournament by a new teacher \"Mad Eye Moody\" someone who you begin to trust throughout the story. Harry makes his way through the tournament tasks and unexpectactly finds himself face to face with Lord Voldemort, resulting In the death of not a prominant, but significant character. By the end things have got so messy you can only cringe at the things which are no doubt to come. This Is by far the most compelling instalment In the series. I've read critics complain Rowling Is writing directly at a more adult audience, this Is definetely not the case; For a start, Rowling already holds a huge adult audience with these books, parents enjoy them just as much as their children, also (like Harry himself) Rowling's prime audience of 8 to 12 year olds are growing up as well, I think It's fitting that children can grow up with these stories as they themselves become more mature. Although for especially young children of anyone under seven, parents should defineteley read along, the last hundred or so pages can be frightning and sometimes shocking. And as Dumbledore explains the stories events to Harry (and readers) Rowling has you flipping back hundreds of pages to realise just how intricately intwined the plot really Is. Simply an amazing read from cover to cover, \"The Goblet Of Fire\" Is to the previous Instalments what \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was to \"Star Wars\", It gives the series deeper meaning and makes an already enjoying tale Into something better than you thought It could be.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I found \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" to be just as exciting and entertaining as the previous books, if not more so. Rowlings is a great storyteller, and all her familiar trademarks are here: the colorful and eccentric characters, the humor, the playful use of words, the masterful cultivation of suspense. The book is over seven hundred pages long, but at the end you'll be wishing it were longer. There isn't a slow spot in it. The story is, however, different in some ways from the previous ones. It's a lot darker and scarier, for one thing. Voldemort and his supporters play a prominent role in it, and their malice forms a palpable undercurrent in the plot from chapter one on. By the end of the story, you get to see just HOW evil Voldemort and his minions actually are. And let me tell you, they're pretty evil. The other big difference is that Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends are starting to grow up. The boys and girls have begun to notice each other now, and all the familiar problems of adolescence--jealousy, insecurity, fear of rejection, desire to fit in--or stand out--are starting to descend on them. I enjoy seeing the characters evolve in this way, but those who would rather they stay eternal 11-year-olds may be disappointed. The story is not as self-contained as those in the previous books. Many plot lines are left open at the end, presumably to be resolved in books #5, 6, and 7. If you think you had a hard time waiting for \"Goblet of Fire\" to come out, wait till you finish it and are left thinking about the next one! All in all, I highly recommend this book. If you're already a Harry Potter fan you won't be disappointed, and if you're not, reading it might very well make you one.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The 4th Harry Potter book is GREAT! Why? Because J.K.Rowling used a lot of imagination (making up all the spells and coming up with the Triwizard Tournament...). Compared with the first 3, it's much longer, but it has more suspense and surprises. The book is also easier to read than other books I have read: The Hobbit, Lord of the Ring - for example. (although their stories are also exciting). It's SOOOO good, that I couldn't put it down- so I finished it in 2 days, with time for shopping and swimming (I had to go with my parents...). The part when Harry goes to a real Quidditch match gets really exiting (With the Dark Mark and Death eaters-the servants of Lord Voldemort). Most of the new characters come from the other wizarding schools(like Durmstang). When Dumbledore anounces that Hogwarts will be participating in the Triwizard Tournament, the whole school was exited. Who gets to represent Hogwarts? (Only anyone over 17). But you can guess who, I bet. The other night 2 ladies were arguing on TV over wether Harry Potter was a good book or not. One of them said it was bad because of witchcraft, witches and spells. The other one said that Harry Potter was a good book for kids to read because it's only fantasy. I agree with her and, like science fiction, I can tell it's not REAL. Harry is not on the bad side- he's against it and he is fighting it. Harry Potter books are fun to read, and they're really interesting too!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "It surprises me that these books have caused such a ridiculous ruckus, yet the Phil Pullman \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy hasn't seemed to raise an eybrow outside of listservs (where they are enthusiastically discussed.) NOTE: This is in no way encouraging any criticism of Pullman. His books are simply wonderful. I feel badly that Rowling has taken such heat for a series that continues to astound. With each book, the world she has created comes together in a much more cohesive fashion. Book 4 is notable not only for its innovations and adventure (it's a bold move on Rowling's part to have an entire school year with no Quidditch matches, at the same time, it makes sense and keeps us from getting tired of repetition.) Another high point is that Rowling develops her stories, and adds secondary characters from the other books to help the story move forward. Did you think you'd seen the end of the house elves,Sirius Black, Moaning Myrtle or the Dementors? Guess again. Rowling uses them in this book in interesting ways. By doing this, Rowling also makes each book an essential part of the whole, and every sign is pointing us forward to book 5. Another strong point of the book is the return of all of our favorite characters, and the newest developments. Is there some kind of romantic tension between Ron and Hermione? Perish the thought, but Rowling skillfully doles out soap opera, humor, and horror and balances it very carefully. Rowling also doesn;t spare her magic characters either. For the past three books, we kind of were split along the \"magic good, muggles bad\" lines... this is fine,except every reader of the book (including Rowling)is a Muggle. At times, it almost became embarrassing to see non-magical characters seen as lumpish, dumb and slovenly. In this book, we see that all the magical beings are not so perfect and pure either, most notably in a rather disturbing scene at the World Quidditch Cup matches where Muggles are hapless victims of a cruel prank. This is good as it begins to erase the rather polarized lines that Rowling had developed, and allows us to question our own black and white beliefs (i.e., not every oppressed group reacts to oppression in a noble fashion.) Rowling also gives us the sense of political awakening in Hermione, as she sees the injustice in the situation of the house elves. I am interested to see this situation explored more in other novels. This book is, so far, the darkest of the lot. But Harry bravely faces these challenges (including an exciting and darkly terrifying climax.) But don't let that dissuade you from reading this 4th book. The only real complaint is that Rowling is hinting that she may wait 2 years to release the next book. I hardly find this fair, as the first three books were released all in the span of one year. 2 years is too long of a wait, and I think a bit unfair to her loyal readers. But, we'll see. In the meantime, I may just begin to read the series over again to kill time until the next book. I suspect I am not the first person to do that either.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "What can I say about such an overly hyped book as this? Only that is was well worth the wait! For all of you who have never read any of the Potter books (could there really be people who haven't read at least one?) think of these books as a series of magical mysteries. It's life as usual for Harry at the beginning of the book, which has him spending yet another dreadful summer with his hateful guardians, the Dursleys. (Imagine Dudley Dursley on a diet! Try saying that 3 times fast...) Things pick up when Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the Weasleys. And life at Hogwarts is as interesting (and occasionally dangerous) as always with it's oddball assortment of students and professors. Naturally, there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (my but they do keep going through them, don't they?) Along the way, we will learn about other schools like Hogwarts (it's about time!) And a new villain - or should I say villainess - is introduced. Someone who definately keeps Harry on his toes. All the while Harry and his 2 best friends, Ron and Hermione, become entangled with the mystery of The Goblet of Fire.... With characteristic abandon, Rowling creates familiar busy backdrop for Harry and friends as she pushes him through a series of terrifying encounters, the usual mischief and mayhem, new revelations (and, of course, rousing games of Quidditch) It's delightful to see how Rowling can stay true to the feel of the previous books, and yet allow Harry and friends to mature (ex: As the kids are officially teenagers now, hormones will kick in for Harry, Ron and Hermione... but they all fall in love with the wrong people! Harry especially has some difficulties in this area.) Be prepared: this is a darker book than the first 3. Some well known characters die -- one of whom is well liked by readers. The ending of the book is frightening compaired to the previos books but is a necessary evil for Harry as the older he gets, the more he learns about his past. JK Rowling has stated that each new book gets progressively darker so as to tie in with the overall plot. As always she writes with a deft touch. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping and imaginative as the previous books -- full of unexpected twists and turns. A delight to be savored, especially you are, like me, already awaiting the next one.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I have decided to write my review on the most mystifying fact about Harry Potter- The Ban. The leading complaint is that Harry Potter 'promotes witchcraft' But, why does that matter? It isn't like we can get ideas from the book and hex our friends, is it? If this was true, I would have long since bought out most of Diagon Alley. Another prospect is that if your children honestly believe this world exists, then you have more problems that just witchcraft to worry about! Another point to ponder, as they say, is the man behind most of the banning HAS NEVER EVEN READ THE BOOK! He claims it is 'clearly unappropriate for all Christians and I don't need to read it to know that' I am a Christian and a Harry Potter fan, and I don't see any conflict whatsoever in the two.

{"review": "J.K. Rowling has done it again! Her first three installments in the Harry Potter series were outstanding, she has outdone herself once more with the Goblet of Fire . I am only 13, but I know a remarkable book when I see one. The way Miss Rowling began the book was very intriguing. Harry Potter and his friends are introduced to situations that children around the world face everyday, with magic and fantasy added. Quite frankly you know you are reading an excellent book when you can't put it down until 2 a.m., which is common for Harry Potter enthusiasts such as myself. You get to both love and despise the characters in the book. You cannot expect things to happen in the Harry Potter series because of how shifting the topics are. At the end of each chapter you want to read on. Unexpected happenings pop-up all over the book. In my opinion the Harry Potter books have terrific characters, plots, and they are filled with the imagination of a child, which makes the Harry Potter series so unique.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Harry's getting older, that's for sure. The first page of this book absolutely will give you a shock. It's DIFFERENT. Our wizard had to deal not only with a mean teacher, pile of homeworks, and quidditch training. But here in this book, he had to deal with a confusion of getting a girl for the Ball, face a gigantic dragon, love triangle, lack of friends and respect, and the Lord Voldemort himself. I assure you, you can't possibly put this one down and had to read it again and again even if you don't want to. Another superb work of Ms.Rowling...10 thumbs up!.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Holy dementors!...what can I add to about 3,000 reviews? Well, let me try a different approach, pitching this review to those of you avoiding \"Goblet of Fire\" (as well as the series) because you don't care much for the fantasy genre, let alone the kind that works so many kids into a frenzy. I never cared much for fantasy myself. It was always difficult to work up interest in works that created umpteen different little characters, with varying powers and talents, scattered across lands that are only clearly imagined in the author's head. Maps,appendices, glossaries -- who needs all that! But then comes this wonderful, insanely imaginative writer named J.K. Rowling. Oh J.K., what have you done to me? Turned me into a reader of books that kids are wild about! But more importantly... how? Well, here's what I suspect: Rowling, unlike many other fantasy authors, has been clever enough to capture a sense of BALANCE between her fantasy world and the real world that we all share. Hogwart's, for all it's magical passageways, ghosts, and other quirks, IS in many ways similar to the real schools and colleges that we have attended. The magic and witchcraft professors share many odd and charming traits that you DO see in their real-life counterparts (and as an academic, I can assure you, there really ARE Lockharts, Dumbledores, Trelawneys, and Snapes out there!). Every kid has in one way or another seen home as a sort of \"prison\" at times, and longed for some degree of power over situations. The magic of Harry Potter is the magic of our own human aspirations. And it is put forth in a world that, while fantastical, has enough similarity to our own that we can feel very much more a part of it. I know, I know, the Potter books have become a huge mass-market success... but Rowling is a major literary talent even in spite of all that hoopla. Moreover, she was clever enough to anticipate the paranoia of some readers over books about wizards and witches, and gently but deservedly parodies them in the form of certain \"muggles.\" So if you think fantasy is not for you, please give Harry Potter a try... these books really DO live up to all the hype they've been receiving. And thanks J.K., for showing a world of readers that magic does exist in every nook and cranny of our lives!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "My 5th grader has craniofacial anomalies and I feel that this book could not have been better written. RJ Palacio caught Auggie's voice so well and captured his challenges and strengths so beautifully that I still can't believe that she doesn't have a child who is living this life. I'm not going to try to summarize the story as many other reviewers have done that - I just want to talk about the emotional resonance of the work. The sheer truth of Auggie's journey is what meant the most to me. There are so many small moments that struck me to the core - e.g. Auggie's feelings about Halloween, the way Auggie has an easier time when his classmates understand that there's more to him than his face, Auggie's struggle to move past his need for coddling, even the food that Auggie eats. The most emotional moment for me came toward the end of the book when Auggie's father tells him that he loves the way Auggie looks, because that it exactly how my husband and I feel about our son. I wish that everyone would read this book, because it will help them understand the humanity of my son and everyone like him.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "It takes a lot of skill to weave the voices of eight narrators into one compelling story, and Palacio does it so well. WONDER is a tremendous debut, a novel that coaxes out grins even as it wrings out tears. I really loved this one, and I pushed it into my middle grade son's hands as soon as I finished. Auggie is a fifth grader. His face is so badly deformed, he spends much of his preschool years hiding under a toy astronaut helmet. When he starts attending school for the first time, he makes enemies and friends, enduring the worst kind of taunts and enjoying the best kinds of friendships. WONDER is Auggie's story, but it's also ours. WONDER captures the dual nature of childhood, both how cruel and how tender we can be with one another. It's about the wounds we inflict and the scars we carry, all the things that teach us to do things differently the next time. WONDER is the kind of story made for curling up and sharing, for talking and connecting. WONDER is worth talking about.", "id": "4"}

I disagree with the reviewer who said it detracted from the story that there were many narrators. In particular I found when I got to Via's chapters, and her description of the ambiguity of her feelings, how she sometimes felt overlooked, and the relief of going away to be with her grandma, I had a hard time keeping reading, and was choking back the tears. I never understood about why I had this particularly close relationship with my grandma, or that some of these ambiguous feelings could be common to siblings of children who are different. Like Via I love my brother, and was always fiercely defensive of him, and like her I struggled with my human weaknesses around him.", "id": "4"}

I know I have always thought that 5th grade is the hardest school year of anyone's life, much less, someone like August. As we watch him and his classmates grow it is gratifying that none of them are as cruel and heartless as we all know modern children can be.

{"review": "A lot of times, the cover alone is what draws me to a book. That was the case for this book. I purchased it at our school Scholastic book sale because the cover and synopsis intrigued me. I have boys that are 11 and 12 and I work at our middle school/high school, so I am familiar with how cruel kids can be. I wanted to see how the author tackled this delicate subject and how realistic she portrayed the classmates. This is Palacio's first novel and I will be watching for future ones from her. This story broke my heart and as a mom, I tried to imagine myself in the mom's position. Would I have been brave enough to send him \"like a lamb to slaughter\" as his dad said, or decide it was time he was in the \"real world\"? For many years, Auggie was protected by his family on outings and his face was only shown when necessary. He wore an astronaut helmet, a hat, or kept his hair long to hide himself from the public. When others saw him, their expressions ranged from shock to horror. The doctor himself fainted when Auggie was born. This type of facial deformation is beyond my imagination and reading stories like this make me appreciate that we were blessed with healthy children. Auggie is a bright and witty child quick with a one-liner and once he had the chance to be himself, others fell in love with him. But, do we give kids like Auggie that chance? One of my favorite lines from Auggie in the book is when he is meeting some students from his new school and one of the asks why he hasn't gotten plastic surgery. Auggie replied, \"This is after surgery!\". This was the perfect way to lighten the mood and show Auggie's true personality. The book is told through short chapters and in parts told from each character's perspective. The story flows quickly and gives you everyone's perspective which I appreciated. I think my favorite section was from Auggie's teenage sister, Via (short for Olivia). Via has always been Auggie's biggest fan, but as she begins high school she wants to be known as Olivia, not as Auggie's sister. I appreciated how honest the author showed Olivia's fears and desires to have a life separate from Auggie, as well as the changes that happen to friends once high school begins. How often do we judge others by their appearance? My sister-in-law sees this every day in her work with the homeless. I know I have been guilty of looking first at the appearance of someone before approaching them. In the book, Auggie wonders what the world would be like if we all wore masks and got to know each other before we knew what we looked like. Wouldn't this be a fun experiment to try?! In the story, Jack was one of the children chosen by the Principal to welcome Auggie to the new school. Not all of the chosen kids took their job as seriously as Jack did and really did like Auggie. Unfortunately, he makes a mistake in the story and hurts Auggie deeply. Again, I felt like Jack was any number of kids I know, struggling between being in the \"cool\" crowd and being \"real\". Adults have a hard enough time struggling with making the right choices and Jack really came through. I want my kids to be like Jack. This book was filled with solid, moral lessons. I will be having my boys read this and should be required reading for all middle school kids AND parents, in my opinion. The story of Auggie is a lesson in itself, but how he relates to our reality is what really opened my eyes. There will always be jerks in the world, people who don't get it and never will, but as long as the number of good people outweigh the number of bad, the good will always win. At least, I am hoping that is the kind of world I am living in. \"Wherever you are, whenever you can, try to act kinder than is necessary.\" Page 301", "id": "4"}
{"review": "...but I couldn't. Here, I'll explain why. First Sentence: I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. How I Acquired the Book: Borrowed from my town's library. The Review: When I first read the synopsis of this book, my thoughts instantly turned to a friend of mine who had a facial anomaly, just like the main character, August, in this book. So I was excited to read it, to get a glimpse of what my friend's life could be like. In that aspect, it did not disappoint. Auggie's voice is brilliant, and you can tell R.J. Palacio definitely spends a lot of time around kids. Auggie sounds just like my friend when he was in fifth grade, and is highly believable. It is this that makes the book so heartwarming and realistic. A book full of Auggie would be great. But this book is /not/ entirely full of Auggie. The first and last 80 pages or so of it are AMAZING, definitely the best parts, because they're told from Auggie's point of view. But the rest of the book is told from different characters' points of view, like Auggie's friends and family. This just does not work. Each character gets 20 to 50 pages, and as I just was getting used to and liking their voice, BAM, the point of view changed again. In the middle of the book I found myself scanning the book to get to Auggie's part more quickly. Not only that, but the plot is lost in these parts, and these supporting characters are not well-developed. That said, I completely respect and admire Ms. Palacio for doing something so ambitious. It may have not been the best it could be, but Wonder has absolutely raised my awareness and sympathy of people like Auggie. While this novel doesn't deserve a standing ovation, I will be waiting to see if Ms. Palacio's next novel deserves one. -reviewed by a teenager.

{"review": "reposted from my blog: [...] A few weeks back, I ranted a bit (okay, a lot), about the absence of aspirational heroes in Middle-Grade fiction these days. For the most part, I'm still feeling tantram-y about the general state of things in this regard. HOWEVER-- WONDER, by R.J. Palacio , goes a long way to correct this. Let's face it: there are books and then, there are BOOKS! And, by the latter category, I mean those rare gems that not only captivate us but also change us--for the better--by us having had the good fortune to have read them. WONDER is such a wonder. It tilted my obit, just a touch, and here's why: The story is about Auggie, a normal kid with a horrifying facial deformity. Yes, I said *deformity* although, like everyone else in the story, the impact of that word diminishes for the reader as we, too, get to know this remarkable little man. The story unfolds through the eyes of first, Auggie, then in sections devoted to the people who know and love him. It's a study in perspective---how each character views and copes with the daunting challenges of everyday life when you're always the center of unwanted, and sometimes hostile, attention. The writing is sublime perfection. Simple, and yet, so, so powerful. Palacio's voice carries the sophisticated eloquence needed to lift such a melancholy story into the realm of inspiration. One of my favorite passages: \"Why do I have to be so ugly, Mommy?\" I whispered. \"No, baby, you're not...\" \"I know I am.\" She kissed me all over my face. She kissed my eyes that came down too far. She kissed my cheeks that looked punched in. She kissed my tortoise mouth. She said soft words that I know were meant to help me, but words can't change my face.\" My heart aches, just typing that. There is so much wisdom in this book. I'm in no way surprised that so many have plucked pearls from its text. I am particularly fond of this one: \"I think that there should be rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.\" Wouldn't we all be better people if we gave more of those and received at least one? Read this book. You'll be grateful you did.", "id": "4"}

My name is August, by the way, I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\" August may not look like an ordinary kid, but he loves to do things that ordinary kids like to do such as play games, joke with friends, and do things with family. He was born with a facial malformation and has undergone extensive, painful surgeries that have eventually improved many factors of this life. However, the kids at his new school don't understand why August is different. As August says, \"They were just being normal dumb kids.\" You see August has been home schooled by his mother all his life and she finally decided that it may be beneficial for August to go to school and try to interact with kids his own age. At first, he wasn't thrilled with the idea, but he made a few friends and he really liked going to school, until he runs into some problems that may change his mind. This book is ultimately about August and how life effects him and is not only written in his point of view, but in other points of view such as his sister Via, his new friend Jack and Summer and others he meets on the way which are very important to the story as well. How can I express my feelings for this book? It is funny, moving and thought provoking. It is wonderfully written and the characters are real. I recommend that everyone of all ages read this book and hopefully it will make you reflect on your life and how you feel about yourself and others.

{"review": "RJ Palacio's \"Wonder\" should be required reading in the middle grades. The book is told by multiple narrators, so we get to know a lot of feelings and how some misunderstandings develop. The most important character is August Pullman, a child with severe facial deformities. He has been home-schooled, but now that he's ready for middle school (5th grade in this book), his parents encourage him to try a private school. Auggie is not too enthused, but he goes along for a \"look-see\" visit. The counselor and principal have set up some student guides that they can count on to make Auggie feel at home. The visit goes fairly well, and Auggie begins his journey. He quickly finds out the importance of where you sit at lunch (table = social status). When no one else will sit with him, Summer walks over. They become friends by talking to one another. Summer thinks Auggie is funny. She sees more in him than a face. Palacio gives us the full gamut of middle schoolers, from the \"plague\" if you touch the wrong person to the excitement over class projects. The lesson here is kindness. Why not choose kindness when you can? I like it that Palacio also gives Auggie's older sister, Via, a voice. She has been pushed into the background due to Auggie's various needs and operations. In high school, maybe no one will even care that her brother is Auggie? Children can learn to get along and to quit bullying. As more and more kids are mainstreamed, it is important for these issues to be talked about. From wheelchairs to feeding tubes to kids with autism--no one should be made afraid at school.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is seriously one of my top ten favorite books EVER. I don't care that the book is written for middle schoolers and the main character is ten. It's simply one of the finest works of fiction I have ever read. August (\"Auggie\") was born with a severe facial deformity that gives him a strange and almost horrifying appearance. But he is surrounded by such a strong and loving family, and he grows up to be an intelligent, amazing, and extremely likable person. He shows that you cannot always judge a book by its cover. Because Auggie is a shiningly beautiful person inside. He accepts his fate and lives with it. He knows when people see him on the street and point and start talking about him. It's normal. Because he knows that he would probably do the same if his situation were reversed. When Auggie's mom convinces him that it's time to join other kids in a private school (rather than continuing to be home-schooled), he is initially frightened and wants nothing to do with it. But he decides to give it a try, and events occur that will change his life forever. He learns that sometimes both adults and kids can be cruel, but there are also a lot of good people in this world, too. I cried happy and sad tears throughout this book, but my happiest tears were for the ending. If everyone could just have an Auggie in their lives, I think we would be better people. This book will stay with me for a long time, in a GOOD way.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Forget everything you think you know about Rush Limbaugh, read the book with an open mind, and you may be surprised at how quickly you get through this entertaining time-travel story! It's primarily aimed at older kids, but can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. In fact, while reading it this morning I was reminded of the \"Danny Dunn\" books which I enjoyed back in the '60s and '70s, where Danny and his friends, helped by the Professor, traveled in time and/or space and learned a lot about science and history. I can easily see \"Rush Revere\" becoming a series that will evoke similar fond memories among today's kids. The basic premise of the story is that \"Rush Revere\" (the character depicted on the side of Limbaugh's \"Two if by Tea\" bottles) is a substitute history teacher who has a talking horse \"Liberty\" (a very amusing character!). Rush and Liberty travel back into time and use a Smartphone to capture live videos of historical events as they happen, which they show their students as they happen. In this book, it's all about the Pilgrims and Puritans, and how/why they embarked on the Mayflower to the New World. Please note that this is NOT a \"polemic\" book full of \"conservative right-wing propaganda\" (for those who think of Rush's show that way - I don't, but I know some do!). Any facts included which you may not have heard of can easily be verified as correct. So far I haven't found any \"clunkers\". There are also lots of maps, photos and illustrations to help you figure out where the characters are and what they're up to. Overall, as a former substitute teacher myself, I highly recommend this book for kids, teachers, parents - and anyone who loves a good historical time-travel story!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Started reading this morning before school with my 10 year old who struggles to love reading but in this case he was genuinely interested and didn't want to stop when it came time to leave! Can't wait until after school when we can continue the adventure together. THANK YOU!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Rush Revere is a great way for parents and children to learn history together, simply by reading it in novel format. This book is written so young children can understand and enjoy it it, yet I tremendously enjoyed reading it as a parent. It is so refreshing to read history that is actually historically true, not revisionist history.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "\"Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims\" by Rush Limbaugh is a book intended for kids and as such it should be seen without going into long political discussions. The author who became widely known due to his radio talk-show career, said he wanted to make American history more accessible to children therefore he created fictional character Rush Revere who is able to travel through time. Rush, who is history teacher will be going through the turbulent events of US history sharing adventures with famous Americans from the past. Accompanied with his talking horse named liberty, it this story Rush Revere travels to the deck of the Mayflower learning children (his version) about the pilgrims and their role in establishing of United States. Although author is saying that his book isn’t political agenda, and just the truth and history as said above it should be considered only as entertaining read what the author certainly succeeds with this book. \"Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims” is easy to read, it's funny, and if reader leave her/his political prejudices aside, she/he will be able to fully enjoy it. Given that the population of children to whom the book is mainly intended, aren’t (yet) thinking about politics, I’m confident that they will like it a lot.", "id": "4"}

{"review": "Got the Kindle version this morning. Great idea for a book, history told from the point of view of living in it. Historical facts gain a different light in that context. Lets be clear, this is a kids book maybe 9-13 range depending on how tenacious a reader. Still enjoyable outside that age range though. Hopefully there will be more books in the Rush Revere line. I'd say 4.5 stars but I'm rounding up like the Barry is on his Obamacare numbers. To the baloney 1 stars, try reading it first. What is more amusing than the Media Matters crowd claiming someone else is being paid for fake reviews. Ha!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I realize some people find Rush caustic, but in my opinion, he is the most articulate torch-bearer of conservative ideals -- namely, personal freedom and responsibility. This book is a much-needed addition to the conservative cause because it does three things exceptionally well: It entertains, it informs, and it manages to do so without grinding a political ax (honestly, I was surprised by this). This book is essentially a pop-history book aimed at 10-13 year-olds, but it will work well for younger kids and high-schoolers. And yes, adults will likely be tremendously entertained as well. In some ways, the book feels sort of like the \"Magic School Bus\" series -- Rush Revere, a middle school teacher, travels back in time to witness the Pilgrims. The schtick works, however unappealing it originally sounded to me, and the book does one very important thing (I cannot make this point clearly enough): it teaches the values of the Pilgrims and draws the connecting line between those values and modern conservatism. It does not \"preach\" modern conservatism into the Pilgrim narrative. I was quite concerned that Rush (as much as I love him) would do more of the latter than the former, and found this a pleasant surprise. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Five stars and two thumbs up! ---- OTHER CONSERVATIVE READS FOR PARENTS AND THEIR KIDS: 2012 Election: The 106 BEST Reasons NOT to Vote for Obama -- This little book is probably my best Kindle buy ever (politics-wise). Tons of research, active internet links, and still-relevant info (despite having been written before the last election). I cracked it open yesterday just to take a look at the Obamacare section, and it reads like prophecy. Written for adults, but accessible to younger folks. Four Centuries of American Education -- David Barton (a historian made `famous' by Glenn Beck) does an excellent job of outlining the progressive decline into progressivism in our school system. Honestly, virtually any Barton book would be a great read for adults and any high schooler interested in learning \"real\" history not taught in public institutions. 48 Liberal Lies About American History: (That You Probably Learned in School) -- Schweikart, a history professor, lays bare many of the lies you (and almost certainly your kids) learned in school. More aimed at adults, but I'd suggest parents arm themselves and impart the wisdom contained in the book to their kids.", "id": "4"}

{"review": "I have to preface this review by saying I'm not a hunter. I don't know a single things about ducks, other than the fact that sometimes they like to swim in my pool and drive me nuts. I've also never seen Duck Dynasty. I don't have a beard (and that's a plus, considering I'm female...) (No offense to any hairy women out there. I'm sure your beard is lovely!) Anyway, I have absolutely nothing in common with Phil Robertson. In fact, before this book's release, I didn't even know who he was. So, for all intents and purposes, I had no reason on earth to pick this book up. But the cover really stood out to me; Something about Phil and his \"happy happy happy\" title drew me in, so I had to check it out. And I'm so glad I did. I'm sure I'm not saying anything that fans of his don't already know, but for those of you who (like me) may be coming from an outside perspective, let me just say that this guy is awesome and the book about his life and experiences live up to it's title. I'm happy cubed. It really goes to show that although we may have very different backgrounds, interests, hobbies, and lifestyles, many of us still stand on very common ground. We all make mistakes, we've all struggled to find happiness in our lives. But, it's all within our power to change. A big life lesson I try to drive home with my kids is that you can't live your life for other people. If you love something, then you love it with everything you've got and don't ever half-ass it. Then, and only then, will you will find true happiness. And that's what this book is about, told through the stories of his past, his present, mistakes, accomplishments, and his close family. Fans of Phil Robertson, I'm sure, will love this book; they don't need to read a review from me. But, I'm here to prove that this book has a much bigger reach than just satisfying fans. His passion, drive, work-ethic and loyalty are truly inspirational. It was also really entertaining and easy to read. Consider me a Phil Robertson fan from here on out. Now maybe he can write another book telling me how to get rid of these stupid ducks in my pool...", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Recently my son introduced my wife and I to the A&E networks television series, \"Duck Dynasty.\" We quickly fell in love with this show, belly laughing through each of the episodes in the three seasons. Going through withdrawal while waiting for the fourth pseason, I found myself searching the internet to learn more about the real life background of the famed Robertson clan. While doing so, I noticed Phil Robertson the patriarch of the Duck Dynasty had written this book, Happy, Happy, Happy: My Life and Legacy as the Duck Commander. I normally buy my books at amazon.com; however, when I spotted it at a Sam's Club the other day, I grabbed it and read it at one sitting. Folks, this is a great family story. It has its moments of humor, but this is a true to life story of a family that is growing rare. They work together, pray together, hunt and fish together, eat together and genuinely love the Lord and enjoy each others company. Phil Robertson is the fourth of five sons of James and Merritt Robertson, who also raised two daughters. Phil was born on April 24th, 1946. His brother Jimmy Frank is 10 years older than him, while his brothers Harold and Tommy are 6 and 2 years older respectively. Judy is his older sister while Silas and Jan are his younger brother and sister. Phil's parents lived in hard times and raised their kids like they were living in an era 100 years earlier. They lived primarily off the land hunting, fishing, picking berries and fruit, growing vegetables and working together enjoying what they had, not complaining about what they did not have. Phil excelled in baseball, basketball and football and like his older brother, Tommy received a full football scholarship at Louisiana Tech in Ruston, Louisiana where he earned the starting quarterback job as a redshirt freshman his second year on the team. Future NFL Quarterback Terry Bradshaw was his college teammate and second string behind him in that position. At 15, high school cheer leader for his football team Miss Kay Carroway and Phil, then 16 were married. Phil went on to received a Bachelors Degree and Masters Degree in Education and taught school for a while until running with the wrong crowd and drinking too much nearly cost him his family--Miss Kay and son's Alan, Jason and Willie. At 28, Phil dedicated his life to the Lord, quit drinking and set a positive example for his boys. His fourth son, Jeptha was born in 1978. Miss Kay, the keystone of the family, stuck by her husband through thick and thin. While the kids never showed any sign of disrespect toward Phil, they knew in advance what their punishment would be for disrespect or disobedience to their mother or misbehavior--three whacks, no more or no less. Thanks to Miss Kay for holding the family together and raising their son's to love God, the land and its creatures and family, the boys all grew up to be ordained ministers like their father. Alan and Jeptha had problems with alcohol and drugs like their father, but they came back to the fold and left that life behind. When Phil put his mind to accomplishing something, he never gave up. Starting out with meager returns as both a commercial fisherman and a duck call manufacturer, Phil and his children are now millionaires, yet are humble, serve their church, minister to others, work together, fish and hunt together, eat together, prosper and live a Happy, Happy, Happy life; and like Phil's brother, retired army veteran, Silas says: \"that's a fact, Jack!\" This is an awesome story about an unusual family in this day and age. Phil and Kay's boys are all married with children of their own now. Alan and Lisa have two daughters, their eldest, Anna is married to Jay. Jason and his wife Missy have 3 kids. Willie and his wife Korie have 4 children. Jeptha and his wife Jessica have 4 children. The thing I like the best about the A&E series is that it is a show that the entire family can watch without censorship whether you are 5 or 95. The thing that I find most impressive about Phil's story is that this is a family who actually enjoys spending time together sharing a special bond. They may look a little weird, but they have their priorities in order. Enjoy!", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I admit, I live in the same town as the Robertson's, and I love their show. That is not what impresses me most about this family. What really impresses me, you will see in this book, they are the real deal! They don't just talk the talk, they walk the walk. They do not condemn others, they lift everyone around them up. They make no excuses, they live the way they believe God wants them too. They motivate, inspire, and assist others to have a better life. They have not let their money go to their heads. They are just real down to earth people who love God, Family and Ducks. They made their money the old fashioned way, they EARNED it, not from the tv show, from selling duck calls and hunting videos long before the tv show came along.

{"review": "I received my copy of \"Underwater Dogs\" on Tuesday and I without a doubt think this is the best dog photography book I have ever seen and I actually own quite a few as I am a huge dog lover. The pictures in this book are unlike anything I have ever seen up until a few months ago when I, like thousands of other people, discovered Seth Casteel's website and his amazing underwater photos. Not only are the photos themselves so unique but the clarity of them are incredible and the colors just pop!! The expressions on these waterloving dogs are something out of a Dr. Suess book. Who knew dogs looked like this underwater? I will tell you who knew, Seth! And he captures these expressions with amazing skills and what is one heck of a good camera. These pictures are as professional as you can get and yet there is such a playfulness that it keeps it from being unlike any other dog portrait book. As for the actual book itself I was impressed at how well the book is made. A book of this quality could easily sell for 2 - 3 times this Amazon price. At $12 this book is a steal and I, for one, plan to \"steal\" about a dozen more copies to give as Christmas presents to my dogloving friends and family. The other thing I really like about this book is that it is a true coffee table book. Some coffee table books have way too much writing. Guests sitting on your couch dont' want to read a War and Peace novel. They want a book they can flip through and look at pictures. But as fun and entertaining as these pictures are I don't think anyone could just flip through this one. They will have to look at each and every page as every page offers an entirely different view of the underwater life of dogs. Some are wide mouthed, all teeth and look like sharks honing in on their prey which most of the time is a tennis ball. Others look serenely under the water as if they are trying to discover some secrets of the deep. While others have goofy grins that seem to stretch for miles under the distortion of the water. There is even one very interesting photo of a yellow dog where somehow Seth captures the image of the dog's face in a bubble that the dog himself is breathing out under water. I think other photographers could take thousands of underwater photos and never capture an image as unique as that. How he did it I don't know but I do know this. Seth Casteel has mastered the art of photographing dogs. His \"land\" portraits are just as impressive and I am so glad he included at the back of the book a small portrait of each dog so you can see what they really look like. This book is an absolute must if you love dogs and I think should be one of the best selling Christmas presents under $25 for this coming season. Bravo, Mr. Casteel, your book is utterly fantastic and as a fellow doglover, I thank you for showing those of us with waterloving dogs what they really look like down there in the deep end.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "This book has some very funny and beautiful photographs of these dogs. It is one of those books that is not only good for the intended recipient, but also will entertain any guests one may have. One issue I had with this book was the layout. Some photos are centered, which means that due to the binding the photos are essentially disfigured by the layout. You can't see the whole expression of the dog, despite the fact it was enlarged around two pages for the purpose of highlighting that photo. Other photos were off-center, or covered one page, which made it much more fitting for the format. If they would change the centering so that photos were not cut off by the binding, or bind it differently, that would improve the quality of the printing and make all the photographs equally visible.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "The idea is of taking underwater pix of dogs is revolutionary and the purchase is certainly worth it. Yet, my mistake, I hadn't realized that the book's dimensions do not allow any larger picture. Double-page images being cut right in the middle due to the binding, the pictures appear less beautiful than they could.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "I just received this book a few hours ago. I had seen a few of the pictures on CNN and my local news but having the entire book to view is incredible. This proves that not all ideas have already been taken. The photography is excellent. I cannot imagine the number of shots that had to be taken to get these images. If you are looking for a great Christmas present, this is it.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "and the pics were fantastic - but for a photobook, the layout was not so good - on a few of the pics the focal point (the dog's face) was right in the crease when it was a 2 page pic - there had to be a better way to do it.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "I preordered this book well before the release date knowing that the photographer always was posting beautiful shots on his website and facebook page. When the book arrived on my doorstep I was anxious to see if it would live up to my expectations. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES. The images that are in this book are by far the best animal photography I have ever seen. They are real, inspiring, funny, adorable, & true to the spirit of each dog. I have never been moved as much as with these images, most made me laugh out loud, some brought tears to my eye - not in a bad way but because the photographers ability to allow you to connect with each image is so strong. This is a must have for any dog lover! I went back and purchased copies for all my family. An inspiration and feel good book that will have you amazed at the photographers talent and the dogs amazing love of the water!", "id": "1"}
{"review": "I assume dogs have ALWAYS looked like this when they are diving & playing in the water. Now, Seth Casteel has captured for us views that have never been seen before. After a 1-page introduction, each turn of a page shows a photo of a dog looking into water or diving under the surface pursuing a toy. Each dog is identified by name, breed, & age. One looks like a shark, one looks like a donkey, others look like alligators. Nearly all have their eyes wide open, the better to follow a ball or other toy. Some appear goofy (like the dog on the cover), some appear scary, all are intensely focused. A word about the layout of the book: of 90 pictures, only 10 have the binding crease touching a dog's face. I didn't feel this was bothersome. I wondered what the dogs looked like when they were not under water. At the back are small b&w headshots taken when the dogs were sitting pretty for the camera on dry land. I don't know whether I will look through this book over & over again. But my life is richer now that I have seen these photos.", "id": "1"}

{"review": "I am using this book as a study tool for my Gross Anatomy course. Anyone who has taken an anatomy class can tell you that color-coding structures is one of the most helpful ways to remember them. There are drawings of bones, muscles, joints, organ systems and explanations of virtually everything that could possibly be covered in an anatomy class. The drawings are excellent and most of the features of the bones are labelled as well. This was very helpful to me since I had to memorize virtually every tubercle, ridge, groove, or other protuberance on every bone of the body. When I had trouble with the skull because the drawings in my class notes were horrible, the drawings in this book were much clearer and helped out a lot. If you are taking an anatomy class, this is a smart and relatively inexpensive investment that will help you remember everything better.", "id": "75"}
{"review": "IMPORTANT: Make sure you READ ALL the information in the section labeled \"INTRODUCTION TO COLORING\" BEFORE you start coloring your first page. This is located on pages \"xii\" and \"xiii\" in the front of the 4th edition. This book is very well thought out and there really is a \"method to the madness\" if you actually read and follow the directions. I've found it beneficial to read through all the NAMES first, checking for parts that have similar names. Second, choose SIMILAR COLORS for SIMILAR NAMES or FUNCTIONS. For example, I chose Red, Orange and Yellow for the \"Levators\"; 2 colors of Blue for the \"Zygomaticus Major\" and \"Zygomaticus Minor\"' and 2 shades of Brown for the \"Depressors\" (page 44). Then look over the basic diagram to get a feel for the order which they appear in the body. Assign the colors in order by location in the diagram. For instance, go from back to front as follows: Red (back), Orange (middle) then Yellow (front). This natural color transition helps solidify the order they appear from postier to anterior or superior to inferior (whatever the case may be) etc. NOTE: I realize this takes extra time planning your colors, but it really makes it easier to memorize when there is a consistant plan in place for what the colors visually symbolize. Finally, color in the Name First then repeat the names while coloring in that particular portion of the diagram. . I also underline the names on the left page the same as the diagram color - just makes it faster to locate if I want to look for something later...not necessary, but nice. I pre-ordered my book as I wanted the newest edition.

The third edition contains all the strengths of the first two editions with dynamite new additions that will help all students of anatomy.

You color the labels to match the illustrations, so it's easy to look back and spot the name of the muscle, bone, organ, etc. Make sure to read the section on HOW TO USE THIS BOOK before you begin coloring.

In this way, the locations of muscles stuck to my mind and was able to recall them on the test. However, I also highly recommend the following: Key Facts for Anatomy and Physiology (ISBN: 0971999694) I used this book for both my anatomy classes (Anatomy and Physiology 1) and (Anatomy and Physiology 2). Since it was easy to comprehend, my study time was decreased. This book was also to the point and it showed me which facts to study more. In this way, I was better prepared for my college exams while other students were still guessing what was going to be on the test. My advice is to get these 2 book for anatomy and physiology class. Both books are well worth the money.", "id": "75"}
{"review": "This coloring book is meh. I found inconsistent labeling for the same structure (ie. thoracic vertebrae would be labeled \"T\" on a couple of pages and then labeled \"G\" on the next). As I was going through and coloring the \"Skeletal & Articular Systems\" section, I noticed that there were a couple of mistakes. For example, on page 17: -the structure labeled H should be I instead (yellow marrow) -structure I should be J (nutrient artery) -structure I^1 should be J^1 (nutrient artery branches) Throughout the book, I also felt like it was either too hard to tell which structure the labels were pointing to or it would be pointing at the wrong thing. My suggestion is that you use your anatomy & physiology textbook/ lab manual along with it as a reference!", "id": "75"}

{"review": "Having little interest in fashion, I'm not sure why I chose this book to read. I guess because Betty Halbreich is being described as a \"tough broad\". \"Tough broads\" can be very interesting people. Only, Ms. Halbreich doesn't come across that tough in this memoir. She actually seems pretty vulnerable. She also doesn't come across that amusing, as she has so often been described by others, and as she appears in the documentary Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorfs. But that doesn't mean I'll Drink to That: A Life in Style, with a Twist is not an interesting read. It is and it's one of the most unique memoirs I have read in the last few years. One reason being that the 86-year-old Ms. Halbreich is old enough to see her life in a much clearer light than most much younger memoir writers. A second reason is she does not come across at all like a shallow snob, or someone who thinks the world begins and ends with extremely expensive clothes. A third reason is she sees herself as also being a therapist of sorts, not just a personal shopper. There are indeed some intriguing insights in the books, such as when she states: \"The lust for clothes is a brilliant defense mechanism (particularly if you are a person of means). The displacement of love, affection, and attention onto a pair of shoes or a dress has built an entire industry. Like all good defenses, however, they are best used in moderation and only when one understands a little of the motivations that lurk beneath the surface.\" And like all good therapists and personal shoppers, Ms. Halbreich does not dish out any dirt to the readers of this memoir about any and all of her famous clients. She wouldn't have lasted so long in the field, if she did such a thing. The closest she comes to saying anything negative about a named famous client is when she tells how Mia Farrow came in one day to try on a dress she was to wear in a play. After learning it costs $125, Ms. Farrow exclaimed: \"Do you know how many meals this would buy for the children in Biafra?\" In the book, Ms. Halbreich says: \"No, I didn't. At the time I didn't even know where Biafra was.\" I'll Drink to That: A Life in Style, with a Twist provides readers with a fashionable glimpse of the life of a woman who was born into a wealthy family in Chicago, married into a wealthy family in New York, and then went on to do something she was told never to do--she got a job. A job at a store that caters to very, very wealthy people. But you don't need to be enthralled by rich and famous people or even clothes shopping to enjoy this book. You just need to be interested in the story of one woman who found her niche in the world, and is sharing with her readers the many insights about life that she has acquired from living for over eight decades.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Because I've been pushing my comfort zone when it comes to reading material, I decided to go far afield and tackle this book. I thought there was a good chance I'd feel indifferent towards it - or possibly even loathe it. Instead, I found it fairly entertaining and I write that as someone who has no inclination to buy designer clothing, shop at Bergdorf Goodman or learn about working with celebrities, all of which are covered in this book. But those topics are only part of what is contained inside. While I may not be inherently riveted by books about fashion or celebrities, I AM drawn to memoirs which focus on the unique personalities and talents of men and women who have created a special place for themselves in the world. And Betty Halbreich has certainly accomplished that feat. At 86, she is still a personal shopper for Bergdorf Goodman, a job she created for herself 40 years ago. She describes that part of her life in detail and yes, she also dishes about celebrities and reveals some of their quirks and insecurities. But she also spends a fair amount of time remembering her childhood, a very lonely childhood. This was the part of her memoir which pulled at my heartstrings and set the stage for everything else. The rest of the book fell into place after she described so poignantly how \"clothes were my playmates.\" I ached for her when I read of the parents who were rarely there and even of Christmas holidays where she opened a wealth of presents - but all by herself. That was when I understood why she was drawn to a career in fashion, not as some trivial pursuit, but as a way to create a deeper meaning for both herself and other women. Clothes were her comfort. Clothes represented security and perhaps a refuge (or at least that's how it appeared to me as I read this memoir). No wonder becoming a personal shopper was a natural fit for her. And no wonder she could share some of her passion with other women who could benefit from her gift for finding the perfect dress or ensemble. While this memoir did hold my interest most of the time, there were sections where I felt impatient and wanted to move on to the next part. To be fair, this may have been because I couldn't relate to long descriptions of designer fabrics, the type of clothing that accommodates various body shapes or the demise of anything larger than sizes 4, 6, or 8 when there are plenty of women who need attractive clothing in other sizes. Perhaps many other readers will find these topics more in line with their interests. But as noted above, reading this book was a reach for me, not the type of book I generally buy. Even so, I did finish this one with an appreciation for Halbreich's honesty about the woman she ultimately became and in facing perhaps her greatest challenge: learning how to be alone. She calls this her \"last step\" so I think it is fair to consider it quite an accomplishment for her. She also notes that \"the terrible fear of loneliness kept me from knowing myself, but now I am happy, because I do know myself.\" As for me, I'm glad to have had the opportunity to have gotten a glimpse of her life. I want to note that I received a free review copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. My reviews are never affected or altered by having received review copies", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I'll Drink to That is a memoir by Betty Halbreich who after created and then ran personal shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. The book starts out with Betty's affluent, coddled, but lonely childhood. Her parents were often too busy for her, but always made sure Betty had fine food and beautiful clothes. Shortly after the end of WWII, Betty is swept away by a handsome, fast talking and fun living New Yorker. Caught up in the after war frenzy of fashion and partying, Betty constructs a luxurious and proper home and lifestyle. As her children grow up, Betty becomes frustrated with her lack of purpose and empty marriage, and after asking her husband to move out, has a nervous breakdown. Fighting to save herself, she falls into jobs in her comfort zone of helping women to dress well. Not one for cash registers or actual selling, Betty proposes the concept of personal shopping at Bergdorf Goodman, starting a 40+ year career helping all types of women find the clothes to help them look their best. But often, Betty is more than a shopper, helping women build their confidence, display their inner strengths via their clothing, and offering advice of all types. I enjoyed I'll Drink to That the most when Betty wrote about the fashion extravagances after the war, and the time earlier in her career when women's clothing was distinctly different by designer, and of high quality, and not the mass produced trash offered to most of us today. If you enjoy fashion, or books about retail stores, you'll find much to interest you in I'll Drink to That.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I loved loved loved this book. I'm not a \"fashionista\" in any sense of the word (I shop consignment!) however, Betty's long journey through life is really what this book is about and I found it so refreshing in a world filled with doing things for \"shock\" value or to show how \"rebellious\" you are (seriously - the in your face sex references from clothes to books to movies have been \"trending\" since the 60's - it's no longer \"rebellion\" it's now \"group think.\" ) Betty's journey takes us back to a world filled with manners, class, and glamour. I found her description of food more fascinating than her description of clothes - but never felt this was a book about fashion - it's a book about a women who grew up dependent on others (it happens to the rich just as much as it happens to the poor) which in turn led to her having very low self esteem/respect. But as soon as she found her calling (which she knew all along - but as soon as she PUT IT TO WORK) - she flourished. At 86 years old, she still works five days a week. HELLO! If that isn't testament to the fact that work + meaning = happiness...I don't know what does. I truly loved this story, one of the best non-fiction I've read all year.

After years working as a personal shopper, Betty made me feel like the greatest treat going would be for her to choose a wardrobe for me. Nevertheless, I can use some of her thoughts to create my own from pieces she describes. Second best, maybe third, but a start at least. What I most enjoyed about this book was my own memories. As Betty described selecting clothes with a specific person in mind, I remembered shopping for clothes as a teenager. In the nicest stores in Dallas, there were no racks of several items in a profusion of sizes. Instead, you were greeted by a sales person, explained what you were shopping for, and sat down in a private room. The sales person appeared with what she thought would delight you, just of few of her best, not so many as to be overwhelming. What a lovely way to shop! Betty has perfectly captured the feeling of personal attention and amazing attention to detail. This is by far my favorite book of the year. I highly recommend it!", "id": "2"}

{"review": "\"As soon as you move one step up from the bottom, your effectiveness depends on your ability to reach others through the spoken and written word.\" Peter Drucker \"Steve Jobs is the most captivating communicator on the world stage,\" says the author in his opening sentence. The book is divided into three sections: 1)Create the story. 2)Deliver the experience. 3)Refine and rehearse. The material lacks direct input from Jobs, is overly fawning vs. Jobs, and is somewhat repetitive. Nonetheless, given the importance of the topic and the value of the material, the book is well worth reading. The following summarizes some of its suggestions for planning and preparing a presentation. 1)What is the one big idea you want to leave with your audience? It should be short, memorable, and in subject-verb-object sequence. 2)Identify why you're excited about this company/product/feature, etc. 3)Write out the three messages you want the audience to receive, and develop metaphors and analogies in support. 4)Include a demonstration if your product topic lends itself to such. (Eg. pull the product out of your pocket if it is 'pocket-sized.' 5)Invite partners and customers to participate. 6)Include video clips if helpful, but limit to three minutes or less. 7)Answer the \"Why should I care?\" that's in the audience's mind. Have a passion for creating a better future. 8)Having an enemy (eg. IBM, Microsoft) helps visualize 'the problem' you're solving. 9)Simplify your presentation (and products). 10)Make numbers meaningful - eg. \"Stores 1,000 songs,\" not \"5 GB memory.\" 11)Don't use 'bullet-point' style visuals; instead, use short phrases that accompany your talk, or pictures. 12)Practice, practice, practice - and ask for feedback.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs is a book that a speechwriter can love. Gallo quotes from sources such as Nancy Duarte's slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations and Garr Reynolds' Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery. He even has a sidebar on JFK speechwriter Ted Sorensen's influence on Barack Obama titled, \"What the World's Greatest Speechwriters Know.\" The message of this book is that Jobs' extraordinary impact is based on his authenticity and his passion for his company's people and products. Most presenters can't claim to be the CEO of an archetypically cool Silicon Valley company. Neither can they get away with wearing faded jeans, sneakers and a turtleneck onstage. But simply everyone with a product or service that improves people's lives has a story to tell. Gallo's book explains in detail how Jobs presents his story so that his passion shines through and ignites the audience. It's Gallo's claim that anyone can learn how to deliver an \"insanely great\" presentations. The \"secrets\" that make Jobs so effective onstage include the usual stage tips taught by presentation coaches: Make eye contact with the audience, use vocal variety and know the power of a well-timed pause. But the majority of the book analyzes the structure, rather than the delivery techniques, of major keynotes Jobs has given at Macworld and elsewhere over the years. This makes the book of inestimable value for anyone who needs to understand the nuts and bolts of writing a speech. Performance piece When Steve Jobs takes to the stage he often tells dramatic stories, so it's appropriate that the book itself is structured as a three-act play. Act 1 tells how to create the story, Act 2 tells how to deliver it, and Act 3 stresses the importance of rehearsal. Gallo adds \"Director's Notes\" that summarize each chapter (or scene), and he introduces a cast of supporting characters. Organizing the book in this way also reinforces the importance of telling a story in three parts; of delivering a speech with three messages. In fact, Gallo concedes, the chapter on the effectiveness of breaking a speech into three \"could easily have become the longest in the book.\" Speechwriters' playbook The book is a playbook for writing a great speech. Jobs and his team start scripting a speech long before firing up PowerPoint or, in their case, Keynote software. They settle on an attention-grabbing headline (\"The world's thinnest notebook\"); then they decide on the three key messages; develop analogies and metaphors; and scope out demonstrations, video clips and cameo guest appearances. Next they develop the \"plot\" of the speech, setting up an antagonist (Microsoft or IBM in the early days), dressing up numbers and including plenty of \"amazingly zippy\" words. Finally, they script a memorable \"holy smokes\" moment that people will talk about long after the event ends. The slides they eventually create are heavy on images and light on text and bullet points. Live action video A book alone will go only so far. If you've never actually seen Jobs present in person, then you haven't experienced the \"reality-distortion field\" his charisma and eloquence creates in the auditorium. Gallo has this covered. The book's end notes provide URLs for some of the 47,000 [...] video clips showcasing Jobs and clearly demonstrating the techniques discussed. Viewing the videos compensates for the poor-quality monochrome photos of Jobs onstage-the one disappointment in the book. Learning from his mistakes To counteract any feelings of inadequacy you might have after watching Jobs deliver a flawless keynote, do a quick search on YouTube for \"Apple Bloopers\" and you'll see that, even for Steve Jobs, things don't always go well onstage. Demos fail, screens freeze, and he stumbles over words. But as with any masterful presenter, Jobs remains calm. Even if the speeches you write or deliver are not destined for \"insane\" greatness, they'll be much, much, better for having read Carmine Gallo's insanely great book.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "If you haven't read Presentation Zen, slide:ology and/or Brain Rules, then maybe you will find some interesting bits in this book. I can't complain about the messages in this book - everyone needs to learn how to be a better presenter. But like many business books, the twelve rules here could have been done in a long article instead of a short book. Then at least the author could have embedded video. There's a lot of fluff or irrelevant content (pictures of Jobs, tables of talk transcripts) that do little but pad the book. I'm a big Apple fan, but large parts of this book reads more like a Jobs love-fest than a presentation how-to. Steve has a luxury most don't: he controls everything about his presentations and has the resources to present in the manner he finds will best get his message across. The vast majority of us do not have those luxuries. While there are a lot of great rules in the book, unless you are presenting something that is highly visual and have the artistic resources to procure vivid imagery, a lot of the particulars of the keynote's will be irrelevant. There are simply better books on this topic elsewhere.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Too bad I bought the Kindle version. I love writing in margins and highlighting in yellow. I'm not just reading this book; I'm devouring it. I'm condensing it to use in my work, especially my writing, but also in my presentations. In fact, I'm going to use this stuff in debates at the conference table during a meeting and blow away the people who torment me. They're doomed to humiliation. Toast, I tell you. The content: Create stories. Intro the villain. Talk in threes. Send in the hero to solve the problem and banish the villain. Above all, always remember (and don't ever forget) people don't care about you, your product, your needs . . . as much as they care about themselves. So don't bore them about you, your mission, your data. So. Give people personal reasons to read your writing, to listen to your presentation, to buy your product. Let them know why they should care. Make them fear to be left out of your influence. Remember, it's all about them. All this, and I'm only a third way through the book. Forget about Steven Jobs and computers and PowerPoint. This book transcends all those things to get to the elegant simplicity in how to reach out and recruit people to your side. Already, I've hit upon the secret to why writing works, why it sells and why no writing book I know of has ever attacked the problem from Carmine Gallo's POV. So I'm writing about it (elsewhere). It's not about the writer, not about the written or spoken product, even. It's about the reader, the listener, the customer, the you you should care about recruiting. More than care, I love, love, love the useful insights of this book. I got a book of my own out of this book that's so powerful because it takes its own advice. Oh, and I almost forgot. Be passionate. PS: I'm not Carmine's uncle or anything. I don't know him, can't vouch for him (to borrow a line from Fargo). Not a shill here, just a guy who hasn't run across a book this useful in a long time.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Length:: 3:45 Mins When this book came out, it seemed as if everyone was trying to cash in on anything and everything Apple -- knitted iPod holders, custom-designed Macbook sleeves, and of course an orchard-full of books with \"i-Something\" \"Mac,\" or \"Jobs\" in their title. So when Carmine Gallo's \"The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to Be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience\" came out, I instantly dismissed it as another glib attempt to turn a quick buck off of the prevailing Mac-mania. ... But I kept hearing from trusted sources, \"you have to read this book.\" As I began to give more presentations professionally, my hunger to know what was current in the literature on public speaking intensified. Finally, seeing a few promotional videos for the book by Gallo himself, who is a communications coach and skilled presenter in his own right, convinced me to make an impulse Kindle buy. Watch the video for my full impressions, but the quick take is this: Every executive, manager, or anyone else who gives presentations needs to read this. It's tragic how many productive hours are wasted with presentations that fail to inspire, motivate and get results. Gallo's book provides the antidote for presentations that are boring or confusing, by offering smart tips and examples on how to prepare, refine and deliver your presentation. I like that he fires broadsides at some of the stodgy, stubborn, stiff and formal techniques that I still see some speech coaches advocating -- yuck! Speeches and presentations should be fun or at least engaging for our audiences, not preachy. This book shows you how to make them so.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "In the past few years, I've found myself in situations where I have to (oh my) stand up and (uh-oh) say something to a group of strangers. I'm confident about a lot of things, but when it comes to presentations and talking to a crowd, my skill could be fit on a dime. On the thin edge. (How nervous was I? I once stood up to talk and fainted dead away. Really passed out, flat on the floor. Now THAT was a bad moment.) So, once I decided that it was time to get better at this, it made sense to learn presentation skills from someone whose \"get the point across\" ability has inspired fandom and business success; I picked up Carmine Gallo's book at the library. For, no matter what you think of Apple or Steve Jobs, he is probably one of the best presenters of our generation. I've attended a few of his Macworld keynotes; I personally know what it feels like to be wrapped around his little finger. In fact, I'd argue that if you DON'T like Jobs or Apple, you should make a point of reading this book. If Apple has succeeded only through this guy's ability to convince people to buy the (in your view) wrong/over-priced products, then it behooves you to learn how he does it... because just think what you could do if you had the RIGHT product/message to communicate along with these presentation skills. I looked forward to this book for the advice it might impart for how to improve my \"make better slides\" and \"stand up in front of people\" skills, but I got something more: a wonderful, put-it-to-use treatise about good leadership, and passion, and what it takes to make people want to listen to you. Because, obviously, if they aren't listening, they aren't following you or the strategy you propose. Absolutely, the book delivers on its promise: There is PLENTY of information to help you learn how to improve your presentations, from identifying \"the one question that matters most\" to using slides as the supporting background to your pitch rather than as the \"read off the slide\" body of the message. The major Aha! moment for many presenters, I think, is that Steve Jobs never uses bullets. Ever. The book made me realize just how often people try to shove the kitchen sink onto a slide rather than underscore \"the point I'll be making as I speak aloud;\" instead, Gallo points out, Jobs communicates three things, and doesn't try to identify every product feature. (This also applies to beginners' efforts at writing articles or other essays, though that's not a point Gallo stresses.) Nearly every presenter's task is examined. Gallo has an entire chapter explaining how to dress up your numbers by using analogies and by putting them into context, for instance. He shows how to control how others perceive your announcement or message by creating Twitter-like headlines. The book is chock-full of examples (not all from Jobs' presentations, so you can see how other accomplished presenters succeed with the same methods) and each chapter summarizes the key messages to take away. Gallo analyzes Jobs' presentations (largely Macworld keynotes; he invites you to follow along on YouTube), showing both Steve's words and Steve's slides. The book is immensely readable. Even better, I figured out what my presentation weakness is, and now I know how to overcome it. It'd be worth reading this book just for that... but to my happy surprise, Gallo doesn't look only at Jobs-on-stage for his advice on \"how to be insanely great in front of any audience.\" For example, he spends quite a bit of time discussing how Jobs has -- and imparts -- a messianic sense of purpose. Jobs' presentations don't aim to tell you about a product with new features; he communicates to the audience that by buying into his message, they are changing the world. People want to make a difference in the world, Gallo points out, and Jobs helps people believe they're doing that. \"Ask yourself, 'What am I really selling?'\" Gallo writes. \"Here's a hint: It's not the widget, but what the widget can do to improve the lives of your customers. What you're selling is the dream of a better life. Once you identify your true passion, share it with gusto.\" This is a really great book. It goes well beyond \"how to give a presentation.\" I think it ought to be required reading for anyone whose job includes getting other people to agree to your strategy and ideas. And doesn't that mean anyone in business?", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Here's who I think will want to read this book: you do presentations and are a big fan of Steve Jobs. If that's you, then just get the book. Now if that's not you, it's probably the \"big Steve Jobs fan\" part and that's what gives me very mixed feelings about this book. The author is, apparently, a huge Steve Jobs fan, which is okay, but if Steve has any presentation `secrets' they're not in this book. I could find no information in the book that indicated that Steve had anything to do with the book, except lend his name to the title. Instead what this book contains is a good analysis of Steve's presentation style and what he does that makes Steve an extraordinary example of how to do specific kinds of presentations very, very successfully. There's nothing wrong with that approach to the topic, but if you have read Scott Berkun's book (Confessions of a Public Speaker), then you don't need this one because Scott's book is better. Scott claims no `secrets,' but his book has a lot of practical advice and lots of little surprising tidbits you can use in any kind of presentation, not just the product introduction, marketing pitch or keynote speech. Gallo's focus is on those presentation types because that's mostly what Steve does. That means Gallo's book has much less to offer to all the rest of us who do conference-room presentations and, especially, technical presentations. That said, Gallo's book is well researched and well written. He pulls in material from Garr Reynolds, Nancy Duarte and Dr. Medina (Brain Rules) among others. He provides an entertaining and interesting analysis of the factors that make Steve successful. Unfortunately, some of those factors are investing weeks in the preparation and using a many-person staff. Great advice, but my presentation is due three days from now and the staff is me. If you read Gallo's book you will learn a lot about how Steve Jobs does it and you'll learn some useful things that apply to every presenter and every presentation. But most of us will learn far more that we can apply by reading others, especially Garr's first book and Berkun's book. Bottom line: on the plus side it's well written and entertaining, but there are better books out there if you are looking for pragmatic help doing the kinds of presentations most of us do.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Today's business environment is so cluttered with messages, pitches, copy-cats, and general information overload that many new and fresh ideas sit in obscurity. The need for individuals to communicate and influence others is more critical in an age of sound bytes and 24/7 headlines. Presenting your ideas with purpose and meaning is at the heart of Carmine Gallo's book, The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How To Be Insanely Great In Front of Any Audience. Modeling off Steve Jobs (the icon), Gallo successfully deconstructs the formula for making any presentation a winner. Whether you're objective is to pitch a product or service, or advance your career, the simple elements described in the book can be applied by anyone at any level. Gallo teaches you how to rise up through the noise. For example, he outlines the back-end processes such as planning with paper and pencil to craft your story. It's not about the beautiful PowerPoint slidedeck - it's about convincing people why they should care about you. Without that (mixed in with strong dose of personal passion) you go nowhere. In the workplace success goes to the evangelist who creates the roadmap that gets everyone's buy-in. This is true of leaders as well as individual contributors. Gallo goes on to layout how to present information in digestible chunks suggesting the use of headlines and Twitter length messages to create key points that stick. In other words, if you build the experience they will come. Seems simple enough, but many of us trip over ourselves trying to get the task part of our pitch down and overlook the heart of the message. People gravitate to you when you can solve a problem and create a change and that's what Steve Jobs does and so can you. My review copy of this book is riddled with highlighter and post-its. Every chapter has a plethora of gold knowledge nuggets that I will be practicing every chance I get. True to Gallo's style, the book is formatted with chapter end summaries (Director Notes) and an easy to follow flow and format. If you ever wanted to know how Steve Job captivates crowds, but more importantly, how to harness his techniques for your own success, read this book immediately!", "id": "3"}
{"review": "So, this must be something like the 5th or 6th book I've read on how to be a better presenter. The tips here are good, but tend to be a bit repetitive, and there's one major drawback to this particular book that left me scratching my head, but let's go over the pros and cons... Pros: 1) Even though the book revolves around Steve Jobs and his presentation style, numerous examples of other presenters and presentations by other people are given. This is good, as using Steve Jobs as the sole example source would be a bit of a one note symphony. 2) The author breaks up the book and the associated tips for better presentations in a logical way with nice headings that when compiled sort of make a \"hit list\" of tips for better presenting. 3) Relating the suggestions back to concrete examples of Jobs' various presentations is helpful, and luckily with Steve Jobs almost every presentation he ever gave is archived on the internet for posterity so given enough time, the reader could look them up and watch them \"in the flesh\" so to speak. Cons: 1) Most of the tips are things I've read in other books on good presentation giving. While Steve did raise the act of presentation giving to an art, the actual things he did to get there are known and nothing earth shattering, so I can't say I learned much that was new here. If this is the first book you pick up on presenting, then you're likely to find some very good things you can use. If it's not, then the utility is likely to be somewhat diminished. 2) In all honesty, I found the book to be very repetitive. Or maybe it's just that you can only reference the introduction of the iPhone or the original Mac about 3 times before you've used up all of the useful information. I think this is one of those cases where the book could have actually been about half as long as it was and would have been just fine and saved some trees to boot. I sometimes think that authors and publishers shoot for a certain number of pages just so that we all feel like we're getting our money's worth. This might be one of those cases. 3) The largest drawback, and the one that I just can't figure out however, is that Jobs' incredible presentations were always reduced to transcripts in table form instead of shown as actual images, which is just plain confusing and disappointing. I'm not sure if the presentations are copyrighted by Apple and therefore couldn't be reproduced or what, but it certainly detracts from the usefulness of the book. If you think you'd benefit from actual images of examples, and I'm sure you would, then I'd suggest one of Gar Reynolds' books or Nancy Duarte's books, either of which have beautiful color pictures of real presentations as opposed to this book which is 99% text with a few black and white photos and NO images of actual slides from a Jobs presentation. It seemed so crazy to me that I actually thought I must have missed a section with images of slides or something so I actually flipped through the book again. Nope. Eight or so pictures of Jobs holding up a mac or whatever, but NO slide images. NOT ONE. Seems a bit counter to the message to have a book on presentations where one of the major points is to use as little text as possible, but yet which doesn't show actual presentation images, and instead replaces them with bland tables of textual descriptions. I'm sure there's some technical or legal reason for that, but it just seems bizarre and wrong somehow and it just left me feeling like I wanted more. I mean, all in all, it's not a bad book. The tips and pointers are good, especially if this is your first book on the subject. The information is organized well, it's a quick and easy read, and you couldn't pick a better subject to study for good presentation giving than Steve Jobs. However, if you're a visual learner, then you'd be better off looking elsewhere, and if you've read other books on presentation giving (Beyond Bullet Points, Presentation Zen, Slide:ology, etc.) then you probably won't learn much of anything new here. For me, it reinforced what I'd already learned elsewhere, but didn't add much if any new information. I was left not necessarily dissatisfied, only mildly inspired, and sort of disappointed by the lack of concrete images from Jobs' actual presentations. 3 stars for good information, but I'm taking two away for the lack of real Jobs' presentation images, and I think the book would have been much, much better if it were less textual, and much more graphical (ala. Slide:ology or Presentation Zen.) Granted, those books cost twice as much, but they're also three times as nice to read...", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Over the weekend I read through The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience. While not all of it was completely applicable to pastors (as Jobs didn't have to do a presentation or sermon once a week), there was a lot of nuggets in there for any leader or communicator. The author, Carmine Gallo shared 18 things that Jobs did in his presentations that every communicator needs to do. Here are a few that jumped out to me personally as applicable for pastors. Plan in analog. Before starting to write a sermon or presentation, know where it will go. Don't start with pictures, slides, graphics, notes or handouts. Research, plan, know the goal and then write it. Answer the question that matters most. According to Gallo, when people listen to a presentation they have one question, \"Why should I care?\" While that is not the only question a pastor should answer in a sermon, I believe Gallo is right in that, if you don't answer this question it will be hard to keep their attention when you get to Jesus. Create twitter-like headlines. This has been written about by Dave Ferguson in The Big Idea and Andy Stanley in Communicating for a Change. Have one main idea you are trying to get across, not 3 or 5 points. One thing, hammer it over and over. Make it look effortless. Preaching is hard work, it is weighty. But, when you stand up to preach, you should be so prepared that it looks effortless. You should know your topic, be ready, confessed your sins to God, preach with a right heart that it just flows out of you. Here are a few other things that jumped out: -Jobs didn't sell products, he sold the dream of a better future. -Jobs explained the why before the how. -The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. -Your brain craves meaning before details. -In a presentation, start with the big picture - the problem - before filling in the details (your solution). -Always answer, \"Why do you need this?\" -Ideas are more easily remembered when associated with a picture.", "id": "3"}

{"review": "When I decided I wanted to publish on the Kindle, I went to their very extensive information pages on self-publishing. So much information! I combed through a lot of it but still hadn't found everything I needed when this e-book popped up in my recommendations. This is a short and precise explanation of all a writer needs to know to publish onto the Kindle. It is all for Microsoft Word users - I don't know if they have another version for other word processing programs or if you could extrapolate from the Word instructions. I haven't actually published my book yet, so I can't say for sure how correct all the instructions are, but they are extremely exact: \"Click 'Insert' at the top of the screen in Word....\" etc. The book starts with a \"Before You Write\" chapter that tells you exactly what not to do while you're actually writing your book - things like, \"Avoid using tabs and spaces to indent paragraphs and icons.\" It then proceeds to tell you what exactly how to form your paragraphs (using Word's Page Layout feature). There's also a very good synopsis of how to form your cover art. It took me a long time to even find references to this issue on the Amazon website, but this book very clearly and succinctly tells you everything you need to know. (The picture needs to be a jpg or tif file, at least 1000 pixels on the longest side, and the height-to-width ratio should be about 1.6.) Also included are info on how to create your table of contents, how to insert illustrations into the main book, etc. Then on to how to convert your Word file into html and how to upload it onto Amazon. The whole thing is very well written. Very clear and doesn't waste your time. Excellent technical writing. Downloading this \"book\" (really the length of a magazine article) is a no-brainer since it's free. But don't just download it for future reference -- read it before you look at the Amazon Self-Publishing page information and indeed before you start typing out your book. Update: I am now uploading various short stories, with and without pictures, to see how everything works. The only part of \"Building Your Book\" I didn't understand was the \"Books with Images: Creating a zipped file of your book contents.\" The writer said, \"1) Go to the folder where you saved your book...\" I thought, how in the world does he know whether or not I put my book in a folder? It turns out, though, that, when you convert the file to \"Web Page, Filtered\" (which he explains very clearly beforehand), and then make a zip file (which he also explains), Word will automatically form two files, just as he describes them. He just doesn't tell you that Word will do this. Also, if your book has pictures (other than the cover art), I would highly recommend \"Pictures on Kindle\" by Aaron Shepard. It's technical, but if you want to insert pictures into Kindle properly, this book is a great help.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "If you are looking for a short, quick guide to how to publish on the Kindle, this tiny booklet will readily fill the bill. And, if your book is less than a megabyte in size, and is essentially straight text, and you do not care too much about the formatting details, this should be the only book you need. I am guessing that the previous description would apply to 70-85% of those publishing on Kindle. But, what if you find yourself in a different group? What if your book is larger than a megabyte? What if your book is not just straight text, but uses graphics and tables intensively? What if you want to give your book a little spice by having certain footnotes point directly to text, and others pointing to a webpage? Well, I guess if you are in this last group, this is not going to be the book for you! That is why my review is 4 stars, not 5. So, if you find yourself in the first group, no need to read any more, but if you find yourself in the second group, read on. Yes, if, like me, you publish nonfiction books that are loaded with tables and pictures and graphs and footnotes, a book that could easily exceed a megabyte in size, you're going to have to pursue a different route. To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, take a look at my most recent book, Impossible: The Case Against Lee Harvey Oswald (Volume Three). Go ahead and download the sample, and better yet, download this volume, which will be free on the 22nd of every month. I've tried to make that book as professionally formatted as a Kindle book can be, with extensive control over all the parameters, including the amount of points a paragraph is indented, what quotes should look like, optimized graphs and images, and so forth. If you want to pursue the route I have taken, you're going to be starting with Microsoft Word, as this book suggests, but you are only going to use Word as a starting point. Once your basic book has been written in Word, you're then going to have to copy and paste your HTML into a program like Dreamweaver. Once you get into Dreamweaver, you're going to have to modify the HTML \"class\" tags, and ultimately move the entire thing kit and kaboodle into a program called Mobipocket Creator. Fun, fun, fun!! If you want to optimize your images, which is what you are going to want to do to reduce your file size (remember, as an author you have to pay .15 per megabyte, so if your book is 10 megabytes, and you want the 70% royalty, you're going to have to pay $1.50 every time someone downloads your book! How is that for motivation to optimize your images?). To optimize your images, you will be using a program like Photoshop. And, of course, if you want to do some fancy tricks like turning footnotes into hyperlinks that take your reader to source material that you have quoted, you're obviously going to be in the HTML world. I hope I haven't scared you as to what the realities of the situation are, and if you fall in the first class, you don't have to worry about any of this. But if you're doing a complex, large book, with heavy formatting, you need to understand why the method described in this book is probably not going to work for you, and you should understand that there are other ways to do the book, which will give you the results you desire.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "Building Your Kindle Book is only part of the story and doesn't explain the entire process adequately. After uploading more than 7 books to KDP, I had to do a lot more research about formatting, tips on how to avoid problems with creating a TOC and pricing. Building does a poor job of explaining the TOC conversion and also fails to mention one persistent problem. Once you've checked your book format in the Kindle Previewer and it meets all the requirements, that is no guarantee that KDP will convert your book in that same format. In my experience, each book had to be uploaded, edited, uploaded again at least 4 times (for each of the 7 books) until KDP did the conversion I saw on the Previewer. It wasn't me making the mistakes, it was the KDP software. This book for obvious reasons does not include the issues around pricing books in the context of this format - knowledge about this important issue can only be gained by conducting extensive research including tracking down the experiences of other digital book authors. Even with research, it often takes 6 months of actual sales to start to understand the pricing issues and other topics around pricing and competition with other digital ebook formats.

{"review": "If you are writing a basic book such as a novel that comprises of text then this is useful guide. But I have to agree with what Barry Krusch says above. If you use Microsoft Word for a more complex book such as a non-fiction one that includes picture you are going to face an uphill struggle and this book(let) does not help you with this. In fact it might even mislead you into a false sense of security, down which you may find yourself in a nightmare world of a formatting quagmire. You see, once your book has been written in Word, you are then going to have to save the book as a HTML file, copy and paste your HTML into an HTML editor program, with which you are going to have to modify the HTML \"class\" tags, headers, and footers etc. Ultimately you will need to move your book to another program such as Kindle Writer that will create your final Amazon book. Actually Kindle Writer enables you to create your book from start to finish without using Microsoft Word at all with full control of what the book looks like regardless how complex it will be. Then you will want to optimize your images, which is what you are going to want to do to reduce your file size and will need to use a program like Paintshop Pro or a freebie such as Gimp, the latter having quite a hefty learning curve. And, of course, if you want to do some fancy tricks like turning footnotes into hyperlinks that take your reader to source material that you have quoted, you're obviously going to be in the HTML world and that of OPF. Kindle Writer puts you in HTML world gently, and does most of the HTML formatting for you, using a special template that covers all eventualities. Proofing is done through the official Kindle Previewer program. The book that I am reviewing is therefore somewhat misleading and quite useless if you want to do more that write a simple text based book, but if this what you are writing then it is quite helpful. But even here Kindle Writer is a much better option that Microsoft Word.", "id": "1"}

{"review": "As a first-time book writer, I find that the format required by CreateSpace for a print book does not easily convert to the format required by Kindle. So when I came across, \"Building your Book for Kindle,\" I was relieved, thinking that my difficulties were over. I was wrong; they were just beginning. This book is written like an auto repair manual, telling the reader what it assumes is necessary, but leaving out basic, yet important information. For example, I wanted to know if any specific size page or type font was required; neither was even mentioned. Ouch. I wanted to know about any special instructions for converting from a CreareSpace format to a Kindle format; never mentioned. Ouch. I wanted to know if the pages needed to follow a specific formatting formula. Again, no mention. Ouch. I wanted to see what a well-formatted Kindle book could look like, assuming this would be it. Not even close. This book used a font with each letter about the size of a gnat's eyelash. I literally needed to read it with a magnifying glass. And every few paragraphs, there would a note in gray that said, \"42 [or some other number] highlighters.\" I have no idea what that is all about, but I suspect it is not supposed to be there. Ouch, ouch, ouch. That said, and most importantly, I cannot take seriously a book about formatting that is itself formatted poorly. Doctor, heal thyself. Some sections were unclear, and I ended with more questions than I had before reading this. I was looking for a book about Kindle formatting written by someone with practical experience, and written in such a way as to clearly address the kinds of questions and issues a newbie faces. Unfortunately, this is not it. I gave it two stars because nothing is all bad, and I will be the first to admit that there are some good pointers in here... I just got tired of looking for them with a magnifier.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "It is really not fair to actually rate any sort of manual-type book or booklet. There are so many writers who will use this information, each with varying degrees of expertise on a computer. I gave this three stars because I had several problems with it; however, I am not advanced in using the computer. What I found difficult might be quite simple to others. My saving grace is that there are surely others who know less than I. In the section \"Tips On Formatting,\" it states: \"Insert indents at the beginning of paragraphs.\" Does this mean that each time you begin a new paragraph it will be necessary to use the Word-default Paragraph Formatting? Or does it mean that once you set the indentation correctly, each paragraph throughout your book will be automatically indented according to your original settings? Under this same heading, is there a recommended value for spacing between paragraphs? When spacing between paragraphs, it states, \"Word will allow a 10 point space ---\" I have Word 2003 and it allows a spacing of \"6\" and the next value shown is \"12.\" The \"6\" looks a little crowded but the \"10\" seems too wide. I used the \"6\" setting, judging by the visual shown. Does this matter? As a help to writers, I would like to see instructions for deleting a page break. It is so easy to get an unwanted page break and wind up with blank pages and I cannot find out how to get rid of the unwanted pages. Since there is a requirement to use this function frequently both in creating Front Matter and Back Matter, it would be helpful to know how to get rid of those extra pages. Also \"Heading One\". There was just not enough information on that. Will the use of Heading 1 allow you to center your \"Chapter 1\" and each succeeding chapter? Is it necessary to include a brief description of what the chapter is about? Also, do writers add the Table of Contents on a new page, at the end of the Front Material or on the same page with the first chapter. This was very confusing. Would it be acceptable to use the Ctrl E to center Chapter 1, etc? I am starting my third book. The formatting is not good on my other two books that are now published, so I do want to make certain that this book looks much better. Again, I must say that while I have used a computer for many years, it was always for business letters, legal documents, etc. Formatting a complete manuscript seems very hard.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "Once I got my hands on this book, I discarded all the other \"beginner\" books I'd purchased. No more having to play juvenile ditties like Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. I'm an adult beginner violinist and Essential Elements 2000 for Strings with its accompanying CD & DVD has enabled me to teach myself how to play my violin while thoroughly enjoying the effort and without experiencing the boredom and humiliation of having to learn tunes better geared toward much younger students. I've only been playing since July and I'm already about to graduate to the second book in the series. The curriculum is interesting, playing along with the orchestra on the CD is exciting, and realizing how fast I'm progressing is a dream come true for this 54 year old beginner.

{"review": "\"For a real violin study, go with Suzuki.\" While that might work for a child that is ages 3-4 in a one-on-one or small group setting (which is what the Suzuki Method was intended for), it does not work well in large group learning situation for kids who are twice that age, beginning instruments in fourth and fifth grade. And to be honest, almost everything in the Suzuki method *IS* an arrangement of an original work (like the Bach Bouree from the cello suites set for violin), chosen because even in their simplified form they help teach the fundamental concepts. This is my third year using EE2000 in my school program. I usually have between 30-40 students at each grade level in the orchestra. The books and their accompanying CD/DVD work really well and are of the appropriate complexity for the students ages nine through eleven. As a private instructor myself, I recommend to all my students to seek outside instruction, but EE2000 provides a good balance of technical development with ensemble skills for the beginners. Students coming into my program who already play don't feel bored because I am able to append more complex tasks in bowing and fingering to them using the existing material, giving them helpful exercises to expand their current abilities, while they help in encouraging their beginning peers. Lastly, a smart child, if they are so motivated (as some of my kids are), can look at the directives in the EE2000 book and figure out a lot of things on their own ahead of the class, and they are provided with just enough information to accomplish those tasks fairly correctly, without doing awful things to their technique. The included instruction videos are very helpful in this case as well. This is not true with most other methods (and the Suzuki books are entirely useless without a proper instructor!). Don't get me wrong; I was a Suzuki student myself for my first few years of playing and from time to time use some of their excellent pieces in my own private teaching (although I primarily teach advanced junior high through college age players). However, it has its target audience, which is entirely different from that which EE2000 and others like it are designed for.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "This is an excellent first book for the violin. I have started learning violin again after a 24 year break! This book is aesthetic, has very clear instructions and diagrams and is designed beautifully. The progression of the exercises is completely logical, allowing you to perfect each technique before moving on. Every symbol is explained clearly, no new note or technique is found in exercises that come before their explanation. There are numerous scale and arpeggio exercises that are marked with a different background color, making it easier to find them. There are many orchestra arrangements (mostly duets), and even a duet with piano accompaniment. The accompanying discs are an added attraction. I don't particularly make very much use of them, but they can make practicing more interesting for children who generally have less discipline. This is a much better series than The ABCs of Violin.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "This book is very well organized and presents the material in an orderly manner. It is being used by a family member and violin teacher. I am working through the material in parallel so I can assist the student. There is a lot of nice beginner material here, and I would recommend it to any music teacher. I am not sure how useful it is to a student without a music teacher, however. There is very little text. The included version of Finale Notepad is from 2003. That is 9 years old! It is buggy and not updatable from Finale from what I can tell as it is not a \"purchased\" version from Finale's point-of-view. I can not tell if the version is the \"Trial\" version you can download from Finale, or if this is something else. It may time-out in 30 days. Again, I can't tell as there is no information in the book or on the DVD. I would guess the other included software is as old. Additionally, the video will not run on my PC's DVD player. Why, I don't know. There may be codec issues. Hal Leonard needs to update this package and clean-up the issues.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "Becuase how else would you learn to read music and interpret that music properly with your violin if you already knew how the song was going to progress? This makes it \"cheat proof\" for young and old alike. I like that. It forces the student to concentrate on the notes and actually read them instead of memorizing. It's the best and most organized book of its' kind. The cd and dvd are included as is some very useful computer software. You do not have to go out and buy everything seperately. This helps on the students, or parents, pocketbook. Lessons are expensive enough without having to go out and spend a fortune on material for the lesson. Save some money and a whole lot of sight reading headaches down the road and get this book.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "As a violin teacher, I love Essential Elements because it is a good balance of music for playing, exercises for perfecting technique, music theory (explanations), and even music history. The explanations are short enough to read during a lesson, and the diagrams make explanations easy. I love the CD accompaniment. It is fun to play along with, gives students some confidence to see if what they're playing sounds right, and helps keep students moving along so they don't get stuck if they mess up. The music styles from song to song are different and interesting: country, funk, classical, folk, and even Christmas music. There are loads of short songs to go through, which is great for learning to read notes and sightreading. So if the student doesn't get a particular song perfectly, it's ok to keep going because they'll get it again in a different form. There are two sets of performance pieces: one in the middle and one at the end of the book. These 5-6 duets can be done in 2 groups or by 2 individuals. At the end of the book, there is a short Bach Minuet solo with piano accompaniment (which is printed in the book). It is obvious this book is intended for use with youth/children's orchestras (\"share your work with orchestra friends\"), but my adult students have enjoyed this book too (just skip those exercises). One of my adult students says he really likes the DVD program which shows you (as you're playing) what notes you're supposed to be on and analyzes your playing so you see which notes you played wrong. I like how the book starts with just plucking (pizzicato). The first 12 pages help students focus on the left hand fingerings and reading music before they start bowing. That way, student's don't feel overwhelmed with both arms and fingers doing different things all at once. I also like how if there is a a song with a particularly difficult rhythm, there is a preceeding \"shadow bowing\" song that lets you practice \"playing\" on the rosin so that you can get used to the way the bow goes for the song. There are many exercises for the bow hold and bow arm as well as for the left hand that are helpful. The book ends with a violin fingering chart which is helpful for those trying to figure out how to read music... although this would be more helpful if it was located earlier in the book. There are just a couple of things in the book I don't feel are very helpful: the early bow hold (why not just go for it?), the practice record in the inside cover (is it for checking off if you practiced regardless of how long? there isn't enough room to write anything else) and the lines that tell you to keep holding a finger down even if you are bowing another string (that's a skill that is not important at this point). Another weird thing is that the CD only goes to song 74, and for the rest of the songs, you need to use the DVD. So you'll have to turn on a TV or computer screen to find the later songs. I also feel that the book takes too long to teach students how to read music. The first two-thirds of the book is in D major. The focus seems to be first on rhythm (different time signatures and types of notes: eighths, dotted half notes, etc) and things more important to orchestras, such as time signatures. So don't expect to pick up any other piece of music and be able to play it, especially if it's in another key. I usually just supplement with a handout about the notes. Otherwise, stick with the book, and you'll eventually get to it. All in all, I highly recommend this book. It's fun and helpful for beginners. And it's the best all-in-one book you'll find out there.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "The first part of the book (maybe the first fifth or so) is all about finding the notes and not using the bow, just finger-picking the notes out. After that, it starts getting into bowing techniques. There are may sections that tell you to \"hold the bow the way your teacher shows you\" and \"do not place the bow on the strings until your teacher instructs you,\" and there are a few sections that are just not clear without a teacher. As with any instrument, though, there's no way to really learn the right way to do it from a book. I wish the instructions were clearer, but I'm not really sure I could articulate HOW the instructions could be made clearer in a written form. There's a lot of basic little songs for the first half or so of the book. None of them are terribly interesting, but, again, a beginner book can only do so much. I went from squeaking horribly to playing \"Michael row the boat ashore\" just a bit off tune in about a week and a half. (Disclaimer: I've played the piano for over 20 years, so I have a large headstart in the reading music department). My husband picked the violin and book up to start messing with last weekend and I was impressed with the progress he was able to make in just a weekend. This book breaks things down into manageable chunks so you always feel like you're progressing but you're not taking on things that so difficult as to be intimidating. My method with progressing in this book is to play every song/exercise until I can play it perfectly three times in a row. By perfectly, I don't mean perfect pitch - I'm going to be a little flat and sharp on notes until I get the feel for it and I accept that - but I play it until I don't squeak and until I can get my timing right and switch between strings smoothly. Using that as my baseline, and backtracking about 5 pages every day to refresh, I seem to be making good, steady progress with this book. It certainly doesn't replace a teacher, but if you're going to teach yourself, this seems like a good way to do it.", "id": "1"}
{"review": "I used this book to help me start self-learning the violin. The book includes almost 200 short pieces which are all accompanied by an audio version which helps. However, most of the pieces in the audio version are played using an piano/synth, sometimes with some heavily added electronic background music which I found was very annoying. The CD features a short start-up guide detailing all the trivial aspects like holding and taking care of the violin which I found rather useful at least. The book also includes diagrams/illustrations and teaches some techniques. It also teaches some music theory and trains readers to sight-read by removing the spoon-fed alphabet notes early in the book. However, I felt much of the book was wasted teaching simple stuff and you only start with the bow after 30+ pieces which I skipped most of it. Whenever new notes are introduced, there are usually redundant pieces playing just that note or with some slight variations which sort of inflates the number of pieces. The pieces includes a variety of world music which I thought was interesting but I also found the lack of any classical pieces frustrating as by the end of the book it would seem that the reader would only be able to play lullaby and folk tunes. The difficulty also seems to be on the low side and it would take at most a month to finish this book. The \"SmartMusic\" software is also only available for STUDENTS with teachers or schools that are signed up with essential elements. This is misleading from the description which doesn't state this anywhere. However, if you are self-learning and want to use this software, you should purchase the teacher's edition instead. In summary, useful material for starters with a rounded guide on music theory, easy difficulty, distasteful audio pieces and un-usable advertised software (for self-learners). For beginners, I would supplement this with Suzuki Volume 1. P.S. Volume two of the EES2000 have their CD split into two parts which the second part needing to be purchased separately.", "id": "1"}

The DVD shows only very basic information, and is full of admonishments to \"listen to your teacher, do not do X until your teacher says to\". This book is really for kids, as the very simple arrangements and 'compositiion' assignments show. I hoped that the bowing exercises would be useful, and they are, but not enough to justify buying this book for an adult.", "id": "1"}

In my opinion, it is great for beginners, and anyone who is interested in learning how to play the violin or renewing their skills, (like me).

{"review": "I read this book in two days flat and I know that, had I had the time, I would have read it in one sitting. This is a book that grips you, draws you in and leaves you feeling a slightly better person for having read it. The story is that of Louie Zamperini - a track and field star of the 1930's, who participated in the Berlin olympics, was part of the US air force in WWII, was shot down over the ocean, was adrift in the Pacific for over a month, was held as a POW by the Japanese forces and finally made it back to his life and has had the courage to live it to its fullest. Hillenbrand is a marvellous author. I was never tempted to read Seabiscuit and this was my first introduction to her work. She is one of a few authors who can write a non fiction story in the most gripping and vivid way imaginable. Instead of being flowery or overly embellished her prose relies squarely on research and on witness accounts and yet manages to never be dull. The swiftly moving story takes the reader from Zamperini's early beginnings, his swift rise to track star, the Berlin olympics and then to the World War. This is where the story really blooms. Hillenbrand settles in for the long haul here and we get to see the air force and the B24 bombers through the words of the men who actually flew them. The sequences where Zamperini and his friend Phil are adrift at sea are vivid and strangely beautifully described. The horrors that await them at the Japanese prison camps are not glossed over but neither does Hillenbrand wallow in the gore and violence as some authors may be tempted to do. There is always a strong sense of the respect the author holds for the men whose story she is being allowed to tell. History has perhaps focused its eye too exclusively on the war in Europe to the extent where the situation in the Pacific and the plight of POW's there has not recieved the attention and the respect it deserves. Hillenbrand's book and detailed research certainly makes a strong attempt to change that. Solidly based on statistics and army reports from both sides of the war, Hillenbrands book paints a clear picture of the hellish conditions that the POW's endured and the utter madness of the war that was being waged in the Pacific. This is a hard story to read but one that is well worth it. The falling apart of Louie's life and his slow path to regaining his life and sense of purpose is a story that is truly inspiring. This book will find a permanent place of honor on my bookshelf.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Louis Zamperini? Who is he? Laura Hillenbrand's near 500-page reply will answer the question not only once, but for all. He is the California boy who was a kleptomaniac. He is the running prodigy who competed at Hitler's Berlin Olympics, shook hands with the Fuhrer, and was almost shot by Nazi guards for stealing a Nazi souvenir. He is the American serviceman who entered the Pacific theater, crashed into the sea, and spent a harrowing forty-odd days floating on a disintegrating raft circled by aggressive sharks, scorched by a relentless sun, and gnawed to the bone by an inescapable hunger. Who is Louis Zamperini? He is a man who overcame all THAT only to be \"rescued\" by the wrong side -- the Japanese. He is the man who went from being a prisoner of starvation and sharks that actually leaped up and tried to snatch him out of the foundering raft to being a prisoner of Japanese guards who were every bit as predatory as the great white of the seas. He is the man who was beaten every day by a particular Japanese corporal named Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a.k.a. \"the Bird.\" He is, in short, the Unbroken One -- the man who kept getting up, coming back, rebounding, and holding on to the tenuous thread that connected him with life and hope, past any duration that any of us could possibly imagine. And, as YOU can imagine, his story is compelling. In fact, in the capable hands of Laura Hillenbrand, author of SEABISCUIT, it reads like a thriller, a page-turner, a fictional product of a keenly talented mind -- proving once again that truth can trump fiction when it comes to stories and mankind's love of hearing them. When you reach the end of this man's incredible journey, you will be awed by the scope of Hillenbrand's writing. It is clear that she did a vast amount of research -- reading letters, telegrams, newspaper clippings, radio transcripts, etc., AND interviewing not only Zamperini himself, but his family members, friends, surviving fellow servicemen, and even Japanese captors. Woven in her biography are many statistics and facts from the history of World War II as well. You will learn about the science of survival -- why certain men live and certain men die -- and about the strengths and weaknesses of America's planes that carried servicemen over the vast distances of the Pacific Ocean. You will learn about the war strategy, the Japanese culture and its effects on treatment of POWs as well as on conducting (and refusing to surrender in) a war to the bitter end. And, sadly, you will learn about the aftermath of war in Japan. It's all here, bigger than life, packed into the small frame of one man from Torrance, California -- a man that could, and did, live to tell about a page in history we hope never to repeat. Both a personal tale of redemption and resilience, UNBROKEN is destined to become a classic in the category of narrative nonfiction. Ordinarily I'm a fiction guy, but I was spellbound from the start. Honest. Give it a try. It's big, but reads small. I think, when you reach the end, you, too, will sing its (and Louie's) praises (at 93, Zamperini is still alive and still \"Unbroken\"!).", "id": "2"}
{"review": "No one can accuse Laura Hillenbrand, author of Seabiscuit: An American Legend, of ever doing a half-effort job of research when she writes narrative nonfiction. Spending seven years on this effort, the Author has produced one of the most detailed stories of an American POW being held by the Japanese during World War II that I have ever read. With the many interviews with the subject during her research, along with interviews of family members, other POW's and their families, reading over unpublished memoirs, personal letters, and military documents, it would have been easy for this book to have become a long drawn-out and sterile narrative that would read like a text book. Instead we're treated to a captivating and at times heart-wrenching story that takes a group of unknowns and present them in a way that you truly come to know them. The subject of the book is Louis Zamperini, whose life would have been an interesting read even before the events during WWII. A relatively trouble child who stole everything in sight, he grows up to become one of the greatest track stars of his time, shattering the national high school record in the mile and becoming one of the youngest members of the U.S. Olympic team in 1936. Many felt that Zamperini would become the first person to break the four minute mile. With the onset of the war, he was drafted into the Army Air Force and became a bombardier assigned to the semi-unreliable B-24. After surviving a number of bombing missions against Japanese targets his plane goes down in the middle of the ocean while searching for another downed plane. What follows is a story of survival by sheer will, first being adrift at sea for 46 days and then spending over two brutal years as a POW in Japan. Hillenbrand takes us step-by-step through the events, introducing us to other Allied prisoners as well as a number of the Japanese guards and personnel. Her descriptions of the brutality Louie, as well as other prisoners, went through are very detailed and heart-wrenching. His daily beatings from a guard known as \"The Bird\" would have been enough to break anyone but Zamperini endured each one. One thing I found interesting is not only did she name names of the guards that tortured the prisoners mercilessly she also did not shy away from pointing out the Japanese personnel who did their best to shield the prisoners even at the risk of their own safety. Then after the war the Author takes us through the post-traumatic years as Zamperini's life spirals downward, and his eventual rebirth as he learns forgiveness and peace. I would highly recommend this to those looking for an inspiring story of, as the sub-title of the book says, \"Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.\" Just be aware, a large portion of the story will focus on the brutality and suffering inflicted on the POW's by the Japanese war machine. It can be at times a very disturbing and difficult narrative to read, one that can bring tears to your eyes. It is both one of the best books of the WWII POW experience I've read, and one of the most troubling.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is the long (500 pages) extremely detailed, meticulously researched and extremely moving story of a Hero. And yes, the caps on \"hero\" was intentional. In the first half of the book we get a detailed biography of Louis Zamperini- bad boy, then track and field star and Olympic contender. Possibly too detailed here, I admit. We then segue into WWI and Lt Zamperini's Air Corps career as a B-24 bombardier. Great stuff here, goes into fascinating detail about the B24 Liberator and the men who flew them in the Pacific. The last portion here is a harrowing tale of survival in the open seas, one of the best I have read. Then, Louie Zamperini gets captured by the Japanese. Folks, watching Bridge on the River Kwai will not prepare you for the brutality and inhumanity of the horrors Laura Hillenbrand brings to life here. Now, this is a gripping adventure story, well told, one that is hard to put down. But I had to put this book down in a couple places here, the story was that brutally true. A tale of unbelievable endurance, hardship and heroism. A real page turner, extremely well written and readable.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "In \"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption,\" author Laura Hillenbrand (of Seabiscuit: An American Legend tells the story of Louis Zamperini, a bad boy turned track and field star, who participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympic and even met Hitler. Narrowly escaping arrest for attempting to piler a Nazi flag, Zamperini returned home, washed out as a pilot and eventually ended up in the Army Air Corps as a B-24 bombardier. Then, in May 1943, his plane goes down. He and one of his crewmates endure over 47 days before they find land, but, unfortunately, they land in enemy terrain, and are sent to a POW camp, where the story gets even more harrowing and brutal. The story of Zamperini's ordeal, survival and eventual return home, with its own attendant struggles, is one of the most gripping tales of heroism and sheer toughness, mental and physical, that I have ever read. I must admit, I was a bit worried that Ms. Hillenbrand, after having written the excellent Seabiscuit, would suffer a \"sophomore slump.\" My worries were completely unfounded. Ms. Hillenbrand has the rare gift for setting atmosphere, including vast amounts of tightly-integrated background information, yet her narrative never drags or slows. Every detail was meticulously researched - I can only imagine how much work that took - and she did an incredible effort of setting the stage. I also appreciated the even-handedness of her approach, particularly when singling out the kind and humane guards in the Japanese POW camp, who took tremendous risks. Another standout section of the book, although brief, was the difficulty soldiers had in returning back to \"normal life\" after the war. This is one of the best books, historical or not, that I have ever read, and would make an outstanding movie as well. Five-plus stars.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I remember quite clearly when reading Laura Hillenbrand's \"Seabiscuit\" about the famous racehorse that this might be a once-in-a-lifetime book for the author, that she would probably never find so compelling a story to focus upon. Hillenbrand herself says much the same thing in the afterword to her new \"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption\" (due to be released to the public in the next couple weeks) -- but then she learned about Louie Zamperini. Zamperini, as the son of immigrant Italians in California in the 1930s, seemed a sure candidate for everybody's \"Most Likely to Go to Reform School\" list. Then, his older brother convinced him to try out for the high school track team, and a great natural gift for running was discovered. In short order, his academic and disciplinary record reversed itself, and soon Zamperini was a student at USC and one of the brightest stars of the American track scene, often touted as being the man most likely to break the fabled four minute barrier in running the mile. He was on the US team at the 1936 (Berlin) Olympics where he did respectably, although it was believed that with a little more maturity his real opportunity to win gold would come at the 1940 (Tokyo) Olympics. Then, World War II started. Louis Zamperini found himself a B24 bombadier in the Pacific, where long distance over-water flying in aircraft of dubious mechanical reliability probably killed more air crew than combat. In 1943 Zamperini's plane disappeared while on a search-and-rescue mission, and Zamperini and the rest of the crew were presumed killed. Instead, he and the pilot survived 47 days in a life raft before being found and \"rescued\" by the Japanese, landing Zamperini in a succession of POW camps for the next two years. It was a horrid, brutal experience, and it makes for intensely distressing reading. Zamperini was singled out by one particular chief guard, perhaps because of his sports fame, perhaps because of his unbowed attitude, for unrelenting, sadistic attention. Yet, despite the beatings and torture and almost nonexistent food and terrible living conditions Zamperini survived. Restored to the States after the end of the War, Zamperini married but quickly descended into a desperate spiral of alcohol and anger that threatened his marriage and his life. But, improbably enough, when he was dragged reluctantly to a Billy Graham camp meeting by his estranged wife, Zamperini found it within himself to let go of his wholly understandable anger and thirst for revenge, and literally reformed himself overnight, becoming an inspirational speaker and advocate for troubled youths. As of this writing, he is still hale and hearty, an indomitable optimist. Hillenbrand has once again found herself a perfect subject (Zamperini told her that it would be easier to write about him than Seabiscuit because he, at least, could talk), and again has demonstrated her skill in constructing a highly compelling story, vividly drawing upon the memories of a large cast of friends and family and former enemies. \"Unbroken\" is a marvelous book. The account of Zamperini's POW years is tough stuff, to be sure, but Hillenbrand's focus on an extraordinary character is unwavering.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "There are thousands of books written about World War Two. Some tell the story of battles; some follow the history of the whole war, or this or that theater. Some focus on the plight of the Prisoners of War. Some are memoirs, or biographies. Unbroken must join the bibliography of the Pacific War as one of the best personal narratives written. Laura Hillenbrand, famous for her story of Seabiscuit, picks up the story of one young man, Louie Zamperini, troublemaker, runner, bombardier, and runs with it. He was lost in the crash at sea of his B24 Green Hornet. Lost at sea, he drifted for weeks in a life raft with two of his crewmates. They broke all records for survival in such a craft. Two of them made it, through shark infested waters, hunger and thirst to land. That's where their ordeal began. Now, a survival against nature story turns into something more terrible and ominous. Zamperini must contend and deal with the blackest shadows of human nature while a POW in wartime Japan. Against all odds he survives, after being officially declared dead and returns to a grateful nation. He and his fellow POWs suffer the after effects of their ordeals for years after the war and again, Zamperini sinks into his own private hell. Then, when in deepest despair, he meets a young Billy Graham and his life turns around once more. He finds finally redemption and returns to Japan not as a messenger of hate but as a herald of hope and forgiveness. I loved this book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is likely to be the book of the year for several reasons. It is beautifully written and beautifully structured. It has a compelling and inspirational subject. It is filled to the brim with fascinating facts (Which parts of a shark are edible? What was the mortality rate in Japanese prison camps versus that in Italian/German ones? What is it like to fly a B-24?). It is the product of exhaustive research. It combines the advantages and attractiveness of biography with the strengths and strategies of suspense fiction. By now, most will be familiar with the subject. In Seabiscuit Laura Hillenbrand studied a California racer. She does the same in Unbroken, with the distinct advantage that (as her subject pointed out to her) he can actually talk and tell her what happened. Her subject, Louie Zamperini, was a difficult child who matured into an Olympic runner, racing in Berlin in 1936. He joined the Army Air Force in WWII, serving as a bombardier. His hideously-unreliable B-24 plummeted into the Pacific and he and two fellow fliers floated in an open raft toward the Marshall Islands, fighting heat, thirst, starvation, sharks and strafings from a Japanese plane along the way. Interned in several Japanese prison camps he was treated mercilessly and criminally. Saved by the American forces in the Pacific, the relentless bombing of Japan by B-29's and, quintessentially, by the flight of the Enola Gay, he was freed and returned home. Enslaved by persistent memories and alcohol, his marriage on the edge, he was saved by none other than Billy Graham. He remains alive today at 93, still feisty and active. This is the perfect Christmas gift for anyone, but particularly for those who remember the war, those who experienced it directly and those who need to be educated concerning it. Be warned, however. Once they start reading the book they will be absent from the rest of the family's holiday activities until they complete it. I highly recommend it and tip my hat to the author for her personal courage and tenacity in writing a great book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Laura Hillenbrand's new book, \"Unbroken\", is one of the most incredible books I've read in recent years. It is the true story of Louie Zamperini. Zamperini, an Olympic 5000 meter runner for the US(Berlin; 1936) survives the plane crash of his bomber in the Pacific in May of 1943. The book recounts in vivid detail all that occurs over the next 2 and 1/2 years. Mr. Zamperini's story is absolutely incredible. This ranks with the best personal accounts of WWII ever written. This book is riveting!! Ms Hillenbrand's narrative style compels you to continue turning pages long after her accounts of the horrors Zamperini has endured have left you exhausted. This book is a MUST READ!! It is destined to be perched at the top of the bestseller lists for months to come.", "id": "2"}

I see high school kids everyday who can't go 5 minutes without texting, they need to have Starbucks every morning, a Red Bull with lunch. Adversity to them is having their phone taken away. Every little thing is drama to them. We modify everything. No Child Can Be Left Behind. If something is too tough or challenging, we modify and make it easier. Any time a student has something bad happen to them or even something bad to somebody that they just know of, we send it grief specialists and crisis teams...for any bit of adversity. I see this on a daily basis, and then I read this book. Wow...talk about night and day. Talk about the difference between the World War II generation and today. This book and more importantly the story, the writing is great, but man what a story. There is not much I can see, every American should read this book. The next time you are upset because you lose your WiFi connection, or the line is too long at Starbucks, think of what Louis and 1,000's of others of his generation went through. From the Nazi Olympics, to flying, to the ordeal on the raft, to surviving the POW camp...this is an amazing story about an amazing man. Read this book.", "id": "2"}

Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose the name Francis when he was elected Pope even though he is a Jesuit and follows Saint Francis' example to live a life of poverty and to love the poor and gives us an example to follow in our lives also.

{"review": "It' hard to imagine a more complete guide to St. Francis and his successors than \"A Life Inspired.” So compact and yet so thorough. Beginning with a short overview, the author recaps the better-known tales of the saint. Then we are treated to short biographies of his immediate successors, those who knew him well, personally. My personal favorite chapter describes Francis's encounter with the Sultan. Read it. His legend has grown into a sort of modern mythology, and so the reader may be astounded to learn so many details are backed by tangible evidence that can be easily confirmed in person, should one wish to walk in St. Francis's footsteps. Finally the book ends with a virtual encyclopedia of famous Franciscans throughout modern history, culminating in mentions of all our most recent Popes. Excellent reference! .", "id": "2"}

{"review": "Saint Francis of Assisi is a study of the struggle between a life in and of the flesh and a life in and of the Living Word/Messiah Yeshua/Christ Jesus. Born to wealth and stature, upon coming to the realization of the truth of the Holy Bible and Living Word, he forsook all to the extreme of poverty for the purpose of the work he saw as his by command of the LORD ALMIGHTY. He stands as an example for all who claim faith today of the need to turn away from the things of this world in a fully dedicated walk and life in Christ. This work takes the reader through his life and trials, even of being thought totally crazy by family and friends. The author also draws parallels with the new and current Pope of the Roman Catholic Church who took the name Francis because of the example of this man and also challenges true believers to choose whom they will serve. References are made to practices within the Roman Catholic Church that are not ordained of the Scriptures but the author shows the drive and desire of a man working within the known body of rule to bring to reality the sharing of the gospel to all mankind at all stations of life and society. The author has produced a work that encourages, uplifts and challenges the reader to copy the life of Francis just as Paul challenges his readers to copy his life..... the key being their life in Christ. I recommend this book to all who need/want to see the Gospel at work then as well as now. The important key is the commonality in faith and the Lordship and Salvation of Messiah Yeshua/Christ Jesus; with anything else that forces the teachings of denominations and men over that of the Living Word of GOD to be cast asunder. Buy this and read it and be challenged. As an aside, I was provided this book gratis for the purpose of writing a review which in no means affected the outcome. Be Blessed in YHWH.", "id": "2"}

Franciscans played a vital role in the history of the Americas. The list of famous Franciscans is too vast to list here. However, they are listed and commented on in the book. To name a very few, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Christopher Columbus. Great scientists were also Franciscans such as Galileo Gahlei and Louis Pasteur.

{"review": "It's rare that I read a book that is so graphic in its depiction of horror that I feel like I need to set it down and walk away for a while. Between Heaven and GROUND ZERO is such a book. In it, Leslie Haskin, an insurance company executive, pulls no punches in recounting her harrowing escape from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. \"More than anything, I wish I could speak of joy that came through all of the suffering on that particular morning, but I cannot. There was none, \" she writes. \"However, in the greatest moments of desperation and overwhelming sorrow, God's loving and outstretched arms were waiting for my acceptance. I now know that His holy presence and peace called to me at every point of overwhelming despondency and paralyzing trepidation. I know that the Lord walked with me through that concourse. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... He held me as my head turned about quickly and my eye scoped every inch of what remained. I will fear no evil. It was another place entirely. It was surreal, like a 3-D movie; too gigantic and slow to participate in, yet too fast for retreat. I felt vulnerable and very mortal. For thou art with me. Everything I saw broke my heart a little more. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me... Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the hour of the Lord for ever. Amen.\" In a note to the reader and at the beginning of the book, Haskin acknowledges that her story is just one fragment of the mosaic of personal stories that make up the truth about what happened on 9/11. Her retelling is flawed insomuch as she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and the factual details of that day continue to be shrouded in a veil of pain. And yet, Haskin provides a brave and powerful testament to the horror perpetrated on 9/11 through her willing to tell us what she remembers, so that we, too, never forget. The details of Leslie's descent from her top-floor office via a staircase after the planes hit the World Trade Center is like a vision of a descent into hell. Her vivid descriptions of the warped building and suffering people around her are harrowing and disturbing. Even after all the media and cultural attention paid to this event, I gained a new sense of what evil was perpetrated on 9/11. But more than being a story of collapsed towers, Between Heaven and Ground Zero is the story of a woman undone in a moment of extreme suffering. Leslie freely admits to the pride and hubris she had cultivated and harbored as a result of her successful career. By the morning of 9/11, she had long since strayed from the Christian faith of her childhood, instead worshipping the gods of money and power. And of course, these gods proved fickle during the slow march to safety that started in her office and forced her to continue walking in fear and pain many months after the attacks. In the years that followed 9/11, Leslie lost her job, her car and her home. Her bout with PTSD has been severe and required intense medication and therapy. Her life as she knew it lay in rubble not unlike Towers 1 and 2. But, very much unlike those towers, Leslie has been rebuilt and stands tall again --- not in her own strength, but in the steadfast love of God. She writes, \"And so I have learned that my life does not belong to me. I understand now how words exhale life, and I will never again hold my breath for so long a time as this. I have relearned to inhale and then to exhale, and as I breathe through Him, the Lord, that is, something wonderful happens --- distance. Space comes between my emotions and me, and it yields an unexpected but welcome gift --- faith. My world broadens until my vision lifts high above the 'soils of despair' and I am soaring. Hallelujah!!\" Hallelujah, indeed. --- Reviewed by Lisa Ann Cockrel", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Leslie Haskin begins this first-person 9/11 account by stating that she suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder. Given that she barely escaped from the 36th floor of the World Trade Center's Tower One, Haskin's anguish is understandable. In her diary-style memoir, this highly successful businesswoman details the events of that horrific day along with the dramatic changes made to her life - and worldview - following the attacks. Although Haskin's writing tends toward stream of consciousness, which can be difficult to follow, her story is both riveting and inspirational.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I must confess that my husband is Leslie's literary agent so I could have some bias here! However, I've read and shared this book with several friends and family members and every one of us started reading and had the same experience -- we couldn't stop until the last page was read. For me, this meant staying awake until 4:00 a.m. to finish. I read a lot of books, and this is highly unusual. (I love my sleep!) Though the book's fascination (and resulting compassion) comes through Leslie's excellent description of what it was like to have been in the towers that horrific day -- it touched me on several levels. Anyone who has had to recover from trauma, or struggled to forgive and put the puzzle pieces of their life back together again will find empathy, hope and healing here. Thrivers are given one very precious gift: their renewed focus on what really matters. I came away feeling a little closer to heaven for having walked, vicariously, through Leslie's hell.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This book provides a very vivid account of the events that took place inside of one of the World Trade Centers during the tragic day of 9/11. The author also shares how that day changed her life forever and lead her to a spiritual place and strong faith that she had never experienced. In the midst of all the loss that took place in her life due to this day, she reached to the One from whom her help comes from. The first part of this book had me so engrossed, as I could feel that pain as the author painted a bright, detailed picture which began from the very beginning of her day to to the very end. I had to put the book down on some of it to recollect myself, as it is very disturbing to read what was experienced inside the World Trade Center that day, but it truly lets you know that faith can lead you through any trial that life brings your way.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "The first half of this book is the exact word-for-word copy of Haskin's other book on the topic about escaping the World Trade Center. I purchased that book first and after being taken away by her narrative as well as the nightmares that haunted me for the next few nights, I couldn't wait to purchase this book as I thought it would expand upon the experience a little more. The first half of this book is word for word the short book she has out. The second half (which is much shorter than the first half) talks about how the whole experience brought her back to God, which I will never tire of reading about, but it would have been nice if it was a whole separate book completely. I felt a little cheated as I already purchased the first half, and to spend as much as I did on the second half for only a little bit more different material. If you are contemplating getting these two books, get this one. Otherwise, you will basically be buying the first short book twice! Still loved it, but the redundancy reduced it to four stars :(", "id": "2"}

The plane attacked not just the building, but for Haskin, also her friends and her life. As a result of the attack, Haskin was diagnosed with PTSD and secured in a mental hospital for recovery. This book is her tale of loss and recovery, from the events of 9/11 to today. This audiobook carries a musical background with it, a piano rendition of Amazing Grace. It does make it slightly peaceful to listen to, but also less relaxing. Haskin's narration is authentic, being the author of the book, but also filled with pain. Listeners can experience the hurt that Haskin went through as she verbally relives the events that cause her so much despair.

{"review": "The Wars of the Roses are one of the most confusing periods of English history. From the origins in the rivalries between Edward III's children to the final resolution with the founding of the Tudor dynasty by Henry VII, there are eight kings, including some of the best and worst England has had; and literally scores of major figures and families: the Nevilles, the Percys, the Woodvilles, the Beauforts, the Cliffords, the Bourchiers -- the list is endless. Making this all comprehensible the first time through is simply impossible. Weir almost manages it, though; her style is very readable and friendly, and exciting without being sensational. Weir begins with a short section describing what England was like in the fifteenth century; then she starts the story proper with Edward III, whose five sons and their families are the central players in the history. She ends her story in 1471, with the defeat of the Lancastrians and the subsequent murder of Henry VI. She only gives a page or two to the remainder of Edward IV's reign, and to the story of Richard III and the princes in the tower, and Henry VII's ultimate accession in 1485. This is almost certainly because she has covered this ground in another book, \"The Princes In The Tower\". The omission is understandable but still rather a mistake -- the conflict doesn't end till the Tudors are on the throne (and not even then, really -- there were pretenders for years). The only other criticism I have is that the genealogy tables at the back are too small to read easily. I tried using a magnifying glass but the reproduction is poor enough that some letters are blurred into unreadability. Even when it's readable, it's more work than it should be; this is a real problem for a book about the Wars of the Roses, where understanding the genealogy is crucial to keeping your bearings. Overall I can recommend this strongly, just because it'll give you the overall narrative clearly and excitingly, but you'll need another source to cover the period from 1471 to 1485.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This is a wonderfully readable history, covering the finalconflict between cousins (the House of Lancaster and the House ofYork, and then the House of York and the House of Tudor) over the crown of England. As the author states in her introduction, the full story begins in 1400 begins with a murder and ends in 1471 with another murder. Weir writes a history of people who come alive on her pages. The characters history has given her are ambitious, incompetent, promiscuous, indolent, and lustful. The tale history has given her is one of these characters acting outside the law, each for his/her own purposes and, in so doing it is an early story of violent \"politics of destruction\" in the literal sense. This story changed forever the history of England. I often judge how good a book is by whether I am moved to read another one by the same author, or on the same subject. I am now reading Weir's book on Elizabeth. If you are interested in a well written history of a pivotal period in English history, I would highly recommend that you give The Wars of the Roses a try.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "In terms of her attention to detail, the author has clearly done a thorough job. However, I've read much (if not all) of Weir's work (concerning Eleanor of of Aquitaine, Princes in Tower, wives and kids of Henry the VIII, and Elizabeth I), and I had to *push* myself through this one. I don't know how much of this is her fault, and how much of it is the fault of the Yorkists who were slow in finally eliminating Henry VI as a challenge to the throne- at one point I thought \"I'm gonna kill Henry myself if nobody else does soon.\" It is a taxing read and while I really enjoyed the other books, this one was more frustrating. The reversals of fortune were particularly frustrating- for example on one page, Jaspar Tudor has the title to Pembroke, which is stripped from him, given to somebody else who is called Pembroke repeatedly but then is killed about two pages later and the name of Pembroke is given back to Jaspar Tudor. So on one page, the name Pembroke is for the House of Lancaster, but then any reference to \"Pembroke\" means the guy is for the house of York, and then when it switches back to Jaspar, Pembroke is pro-Lancaster again-- So at some point you think to yourself, \"Wait, why is Pembroke for Edward- I thought he liked Henry... Oh yeah...\" One wonders why (for the sake of clarity)- Jaspar Tudor just can't be called Jaspar Tudor throughout. She is accurate, but at some point I wish clarity had become a priority. While this is a complaint that I and others have had about all of Weir's (and other historians' books), it's particularly troublesome here because of the vast number of people involved, as well as the number of years that it covers. If you are interested in the wars of the roses or the succession of the British monarchy, please, by all means get this book. My primary purpose in this recommendation is to set your expectations- I'm very glad I read the thing- I just wish I'd known what a task it would be. Reading this book is like going to the gym- I don't actually like doing it, but I like having done it.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I really enjoy learning about British history - and Alsison Weir does a great job. I did find, however, that The Wars of the Roses was the most complicated of her books that I have read. I believe this is because she almost has too much information and tries to share it all. Additionally, the names of people become very confusing in that people take on the names of their title. For example a man would be the Duke of York, then when he died, his son would be the Duke of York. Weir would say \"York...\" and it would be tough to know whether or not the switch had happened, and because there may be more than 2 people with this name through out the book, it serves to require a lot of effor to understand who was who, while reading the book. The charts at the back help, but again, it would have been nice to have a little more information to make the story easier to follow. Overall I find Alison Weir to be a great teller of history, but I were a new reader to this, I would start with The Six Wives of Henry VIII.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "\"The Wars of the Roses\" is an altogether fascinating account of what may be, I suspect , a not so well understood era of English medieval history. Alison Weir tells the story of the wars between the Houses of Lancaster and York in 15th century England in a most compelling manner. She allows the reader to get to know such disparate characters as the weak and unstable usurper Lancastrian King Henry VI and his ambitious and ruthless queen, Margaret of Anjou; the Duke of York, who led the fight against the Lancasters, at first attempting to establish good government in England under Henry VI, and later, with an eye toward taking the English throne for himself; and York's son, Edward, conscientious and competent, who, after the Duke's death, picked up his father's fallen banner and deposed Henry VI, becoming King Edward IV, and ultimately ending the Wars of the Roses. Weir weaves personalities and a highly complex series of events into a well organized, easily understandable and highly entertaining narrative. I found \"The Wars of the Roses\" to be thoroughly enjoyable and very well written indeed.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I can say nothing but huge amount of praises for Allison Weir's War of the Roses. Its superbly readable, entertainingly fun and quite educational. But why would an author of her scholarship end the account of the War of the Roses at Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471? This is supposed to be a book on the War of the Roses, right? Its like writing a book on World War II and ending it at Stalingrad and Fall of Tunis in first half of 1943!! I read Weir's Princes in the Tower and that book is more like an investigation of their death and the blame. War of the Roses stuff were basically background material. So it can't be considered as \"second volume\" of this book. Since anyone who knows anything about War of Roses knows that the war \"officially\" ended with Battle of Bosworth in 1485 which saw the fall of Richard Plantagent to Henry Tudor which resulted in the total change of the royal line (even if they are all related in one ways or another), this book should have gone on that point. Weir probably thought that after Tewkesbury, there wasn't much going on military wise for 14 years until Bosworth but politics can be considered as a form of warfare back then and there were a lot of that going on to make War of the Roses one of the more interesting military conflicts in history. But until she stopped, Weir does a very good job and maybe, she can write a real \"second volume\" of this book.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "The time was fascinating enough for Shakespeare to have devoted three plays to it, and several more to its prelude. The various descendants of Edward III were fighting each other for the crown of England (and parts of France) throughout the middle 15th century, in a battle of cousin against cousin (even brother against brother) that later on became known as The Wars of the Roses. In this book Alison Weir gives a blow-by-blow account of the various conflicts in the reign of Henry VI and Edward IV. She has a long prelude wherein she sets the stage with the deposing of Richard II by Henry Bolingbroke (who became, then, Henry IV), his subsequent career, and that of Henry V, who died leaving the baby Henry VI king, setting the stage for the power struggles to come. Weir has clearly mastered her material, but still this story seemed curiously lifeless. There are murders and betrayals aplenty, and even occasional selfless and heroic behavior, but presented rather matter-of-factly. Besides this, there are a couple of problems that I see. One is perhaps typical of a history: unless the historian has the flair of a storyteller, it just becomes one damn thing after another. I found little that was compelling in a narrative with great possibilities, nor motivation for what seemed to be bizarre behavior on everyone's part. Another problem here was simply in a lack of supporting material. Maps of territories being contested, and diagrams of battles, would help to place these events in space and give each fight an identity. What is more, a dense chronicle like this one needs to be bristling with dates, perhaps as a running comment in a margin. We are given the day and the month constantly as things go on, but I found myself having forgotten the year, and unable to find it. Rather than constantly wading through detail, a reader should be able to get out and see the wider picture from time to time, too. It is with some relief that I turn to the Henry VI plays, even though the history is compressed and distorted to serve the drama. In Shakespeare, it all makes sense, somehow.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Weir does nothing so well as interpret fact. She succeeds more than most writers in conveying historical context, which is critical for a reader of history. It is almost impossible for us in the 20th century to put ourselves in the places of the people who participated in the Wars of the Roses without the help of someone like her. I especially recommend this book for readers of historical fiction. Weir's prose flows almost as smoothly as any novelist's, but you are left with history (as best as it can presented), not some fantasy. The Richard III fans out there should read this BEFORE reading the Princes in the Tower. While it is sometimes easier to read history when you already know what happens next, this book will hammer home needed perspective; such as, why pretenders to be kings (and princes) were doomed to death and not just doomed to losing their crowns.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "While Weir's book on the Wars of the Roses is very easy to read and very interesting, I find myself feeling lukewarm towards it. On the one hand, it is detailed just enough to be informative and not too convoluted; it is smoothly-written and gives a clear chronology of events; it begins at the root of the wars and continues until the Battle of Tewkesbury; and it attempts to illuminate the individual characters of important historical figures of the age. On the other hand, it was at times hysterically written, putting together known facts with completely unsupported statements (I still cannot figure out how, without any definitive accounts of Richard of York's appearance in existence, Weir confidently describes him as short, stout and square-faced, and then dismisses out-of-hand other possible descriptions of him). Then there's this gem taken from page 323: \"Edward was oblivious to the fact that [Elizabeth Wydville] was also calculating, ambitious, greedy, ruthless and arrogant.\" Let us forget for a moment that Weir forgot to put a comma after \"ruthless\". What irked me about this statement was that, despite its condemning and final tone, it is never backed up with any substantial form of reasoning. The reader is simply told this and never given any explanation. Weir brings up the fact that Elizabeth Woodville made her mother serve her on bended knee and her brother kneel to her in public, but this was common practice for queens of the era. Weir also calls the family rapacious for taking positions in court, a practice which was, for one, natural of a new queen's family, and two, not as extensive as she makes it out to be. While a case can certainly be made--justly or unjustly, as it may be evaluated--that Elizabeth was in fact greedy, ruthless, or calculating, it should not be made based on the flimsy support that Weir has employed, and certainly not in such an absolute manner. This is where I believe Weir was using hysterical writing to heighten the dramatic and gossipy feeling of the book. It's entertaining, to be sure, but not necessarily in good judgment, and leaves the reader somewhat shortchanged. The writing in itself is very standard and nothing special. In fact, it's almost average, but that did not hinder my reading of it because this is, after all, a history book which I was reading for history's sake. It's always nice when historians have literary talent too, but it's not strictly speaking necessary, at least in my opinion. One thing that did bother me, however, was the fact that the editor failed to catch a few mistakes where quotes were left open-ended (in other words, the end quotation mark was missing), leaving the reader to figure out where the quote ended and Weir's narrative recommenced. Though it was mostly a simple task to figure out, a few instances were hard to discern. Also, though this is no fault of Weir's, I would warn prospective buyers that this book only covers the events up to and including the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. Those wishing to read further must then acquire Weir's book on the princes in tower. Overall, I found The Wars of the Roses to be a fun, entertaining history, although Weir can fall into the habit of overstating her conclusions about certain figures and events which begins to seem a little like bias, although it doesn't totally cross that line. It seems that she was, for the most part, trying to be balanced, and this is a useful tool for anyone who wants a basic knowledge of the Wars. Buffs will not gain much from its reading, as it is mostly a chronology of main events with the usual detail. 3 stars. Recommended.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Weir does a good job of portraying a complicated period in English history. With that said, following are the main reasons why I did not give this book 5 stars. First, Weir is not consistent in the way that she refers to people. She would do all of her fans a big favor by referring to people by the given names, surnames and titles. This is especially true in a book like this where people's titles changed throughout the book due to their loyalty to one monarch or another, to the death of a father or to their marriage. Second, Weir's sentence structure is overly complicated at times. Third, although Weir includes eight genealogies of the main families involved in the book, they are very difficult to read because they use script for the typeface, rather than a more readible typeface. She does a masterful job of giving the reader a vivid picture of the personalities of the individuals involved in the Wars. Weir is also careful to point out the differences in opinion held by historians regarding issues like the number of people involved in the battles or the people responsible for deaths of certain individuals such as Henry VI. For those who are interested in pursuing this period in more detail, I recommend Charles Ross' The Wars of the Roses (an excellent survey of the period) or his biographies of Edward IV and Richard III. Ross is an expert on this period and was a professor of medieval history prior to his death. Although Ross is a traditional historian who uses loads of footnotes, his books are very easy to read.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "George Mahood is the sort of chap you'd like to have a beer with. Actually, I think he's the kind of fellow you'd find yourself buying a beer for after just the briefest of conversations. I say this having never met the man but I feel like I've just had the adventure of a lifetime with my new pal after having read his very funny and surprisingly inspirational book Free Country. Free Country tells the true story of two young men, George and his friend Ben, who decide to cycle the length of Britain from Land's End to John O Groats. While this ambitious journey has been undertaken by many others, none have done it in quite the same way as George and Ben. Because, you see, they begin with nothing. Well, not quite nothing, they each have a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts (and George later confesses, a camera, a notebook, a pencil and stack of cards containing the words \"I am OFFICIALLY a very nice person.\") Over three weeks in September, with a vow to spend no money they wander their way north like the maddest of monks on the most quixotic of quests. What they find along the way is a country filled with very interesting people, a great number of whom are very nice. Ben and George manage, through charm, wit, fast talking and willingness to do tasks ranging from cleaning, to loading onions to singing for their suppers, to acquire clothes, food, bicycles and someplace to sleep every night. It is a wonderful adventure and very, very funny. George is a great observer of life and a very witty writer and he and Ben bicker throughout the journey in the way that only true friends can. A few quotes will give you the flavor of this delightful book: `Yeah. There's a place called Neilston in another ten miles.' `Ten miles? Are you kidding me?' asked Ben. `Err, no. It doesn't look like there's anything else before there anyway. We've done really well today. I reckon we'll have done over 90 miles.' `WHAT? My god, you are such a slave driver. If I'd known we had done anything near that much, I would have stopped for the day ages ago.' `I know. That's why I didn't tell you.' ----- Before eating the sandwiches we tried a rendition of Silent Night in German that I could still remember from primary school. A guy on a bmx, in his mid thirties, approached with a small paper bag from Greggs. `Hi guys. You can have these two donuts if you promise to stop singing.' `You've got yourself a deal. Thanks, mate,' I said. ----- The descent from Kirkstone Pass was undoubtedly the fastest I have ever been on a bike. It was possibly the fastest that man has ever travelled, in any form of transport. If The Falcon had had wings, I swear she would have taken off. It was one of the scariest, but most exhilarating things I have ever done. Braking wasn't really an option for me, as The Falcon's brakes only had any slight effect when travelling at a ridiculously slow speed, or uphill. I just gave in and let The Falcon do what she was best at doing - not stopping. ----- We explained our challenge and asked if there was anything we could do in exchange for some free food. `Oooooh, what do you reckon, Jan? Should we give these two strapping young lads any food?' she said to her colleague. `Yeah, why not. If that one with the skimpy shorts shows us a bit more leg,' she laughed. `That'll be you then, George,' said Ben. This was a new low. I was being made to flaunt my body in exchange for food. I felt used. I felt cheap. I liked it. I lifted up the side of my skimpy blue shorts, and exposed my flabby white thighs. `Phwoooooaarr,' said both ladies... ----- If a nutritionist had analysed what we ate during the bike ride, I think they probably would have concluded that we should not be alive, let alone fit enough to cycle. I read somewhere that beige food is bad for you. Almost everything we ate was a shade of beige; bread, pasta bakes, chips, pasties and bananas. Anyway, all I'm saying is that peas and carrots taste unbelievable if you only eat beige food for 17 days beforehand. Give it a try. ----- Free Country is one of the funniest books I've ever read and it is a book that celebrates the tremendous kindness that exists in the world. George and Ben completed their journey thanks to the kindness of strangers, but after reading the tale of their journey, I feel that I owe them much more than the meager cost of this book for the laughter and wisdom I've found in its pages. George and Ben, if you ever make it to Issaquah, look me up. I'll make sure you've got a good meal and a place to stay.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "George Mahood writes with an engaging style, the adventure is preposterously wonderful, and the book is a fun read. I knocked off a few stars for the vulgarity, and as the writing gives witness to the author's delightfully wide vocabulary, I saw no need for so much of it. He includes a little too much information about pain in his private parts as well--it was his choice of bicycle seat, after all. I also grew weary of his calling Ben a wuss so frequently when Ben pedaled just as far on a donated bike, put up with all George's rules, and slept and ate under the same conditions. Both of these young men possess a great sense of adventure, as well as a good supply of creativity, charm, humor, and incredible perseverance. My hat is off to both of them, and with the exception of the few details mentioned above, I recommend the book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Without duplicating the comments of other reviewers, let me just say that the book gives you a feeling for the real Britain and has some laugh-out-loud passages. And the Kindle edition is fairly priced (other publishers, take note). It will help American readers to know a few British terms. Right from the first sentence, you need to know that British pants = American underpants. British trainers = American sneakers. I had to look up \"chip butties\" (French-fry-and-ketchup sandwiches, which restores my faith in British cuisine). As for Ben's ill-timed remark that he will \"roger\" Mrs. Rogers, you can look that one up yourself ...", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Many great travelogues have at their centre a streak of insanity - what made this couple uproot from cosy Surrey and start keeping bees in Roumania? What made this family of seven want to sail the Pacific Ocean in a dinghy? `Free Country' takes this insanity to a whole new level - two barmy Brits decide to bike-ride the full length of the UK, from Land's End to John O'Groats, in just three weeks - with no clothing (except the boxer shorts they stand up in), no food, no money...and no bikes. \"Why??\" you might ask.\"What special kind of madness is this??\" The simple answer is: `to prove the kindness of strangers.' Britain is not broken, the author (and friend Ben) have us believe. We are not a nation that has lost sight of basic values of humanity and kinship, there lies within everyone the desire to help others. And so the plucky twosome plunge into their 1000 mile journey without money and provisions, relying entirely on the mercy and generosity of strangers to get them through. Starting out with one trainer and half a pair of socks, graduating to a pair of wellies four sizes too small and six pairs of the biggest socks in existence, the pair acquire a scooter and a mini BX and are on their way! What follows is the road trip to end all road trips - a kind of Around the World in Eighty Days meets Around Ireland with a Fridge - with a bevy of colourful characters (crazy, pizza-tossing Arek, even crazier phone-freak Roobals, Glastonbury-legend Michael Eavis) and, for me at least, a belly-laugh on practically every page. My favourite line? `It is bloody cold and windy on the top of a mountain in a pair of silky shorts and a T-shirt.' Well yeah, it must be!! I was genuinely sad when the dustbin-diving duo, having slept in a cling-filmed polytunnel, a hitman's sitting room, and a stable with an unexpected \"Surprise\" in it (and having survived on pic n'mix and `beige' food for 18 days) finally approached the finish line.

{"review": "This book is a joy from start to finish. Follow George and Ben on their outlandish adventure to complete the famed End-to-End journey starting out with nothing more than two pairs of novelty boxer shorts and a crazy idea. The author and his pal are committed to completing the 1000-mile trip from Land's End to John O'Groats without spending a single shilling. Throughout this unique and often laugh-out-loud funny travelogue, readers meet a colorful array of people and see a part of Britain far off the bustling tourist trail. Drawn by the subject matter and the novelty of the approach, I was immediately taken in by George Mahood's fine writing and classically British self-deprecating humor. Having cycled from London to Edinburgh and back a few years ago myself under rather different circumstances, I was reminded reading this book of the beauty and majesty (and hills) that await cyclists interested in making the journey. As an obsessive cyclist in search of long distance adventure, I am inspired to make the same trek (albeit with a nicer bike and far more gear) myself someday. The book has broad appeal, however, and rarely devolves into cycling minutiae so it is equally appealing to non-cyclists. In fact, I think it's fair to call George and Ben non-cyclists despite their accomplishment. While I won't give away the ending, I will say that it's nearly impossible to finish this book without developing a bit more hope for the human race. This book is a delight. Treat yourself. It's a bargain at twice the price.", "id": "2"}

While Ben isn't in the same league as the epic Katz from A Walk in the Woods, the friendship and travails and even disputes of Ben and the author are what keep the story going. The only downside is that, being British, the author occasionally makes references to things which non-Brits might not get. They are infrequent, and you can pick up the meaning even if the reference passes you by. There are dozens of other positive reviews, I just wanted to make note of the fact that you will feel much better having read this book.", "id": "2"}

{"review": "At what should be the most stable and happiest time of his life, Mishka Shubaly is still learning from his tumultuous past and coping with life. An alcoholic (now 5 years sober), the child of divorced parents, and a man who has lost too many friends to drugs and violence, Mishka is determined to save a tiny, seemingly meaningless life in the form of a baby mouse he names Mishkalito. What Mishkalito represents, however, is far more than a mere mouse as Mishka uses this time to reflect on his past... and his future. 'Of Mice and Me' gives us another raw, humorous and very personal glimpse into his life through this work of creative non-fiction. Playing leading roles are Mishka's nieces and nephews, a brood of well-mannered children. Mishka's interactions with his family are heart-warming and often hilarious and what make 'Of Mice and Me' stand out from his other works. At its core, this is a story about family, and Mishka's exploration as to whether he is ready, deserves, or even wants one of his own. Very well-written, funny, endearing, and highly relatable, I recommend 'Of Mice and Me' to anyone who is a fan of Mishka's previous works, anyone who is contemplating forming a family, or simply anyone who wants a good read.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "The latest by Mishka Shubaly starts off kind of wobbly. It wasn't the beginning I was expecting having known the story of his little mouse, Mishkalito, from social media; specifically the blog post on his website. This beginning was different from his other Singles---unsteady. However, having written that... This story takes us directly to Mishka's heart, which after reading this book, or any of his others, we know is a rocky journey. \"Of Mice and Me\" lands us squarely on his vulnerability; hence the \"walking in stilettos on a cobble stone road\" feeling I had at the start. The man who admittedly fears love and caring for others outside of his family and friends---even they aren't immune to his reluctance---is actually overflowing with these exact emotions, and the need to both give and receive each; perhaps not a shock to those closest to him. Everything this little creature is, and comes to mean, are a reflection of his rescuer, \"Mice are pests, people say. They ruin stuff and spread disease; they make no positive contribution. People said that about me too.\" Mishka finds many similarities between himself and his mouse kid, wondering, \"Maybe the source of my suffering would turn out to be some tiny oracle, squeaking the answer in my ear.\" He found himself hidden in the form of a mouse; a perfect catalyst for realization that, \"Whenever you are offered a chance to love, you must take it.\" Mishka's previous Singles offer us a lot about his past and his present surroundings; sobriety, running and personal relationships, all are a constant in his writings. \"Of Mice and Me\" presents us with his stripped down heart. Caring for Mishkalito gave Mishka the opportunity to love and care for something outside of family, friends, girlfriends; an uncomfortable, both figuratively and literally, experience. A baby mouse found in his sister's backyard---a fragile life that needed some forgiveness and tenderness, a safe place to stay and a warm hand to help it through a tough time. It's kind of perfect. It's kind of awesome. It's kind of like Mishka, himself.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I've enjoyed many short stories in the Singles format because, thanks to the proliferation of instant gratification information platforms, I have the attention span of a gnat. A good writer doesn't need a novel to make an impact, and Mishka's story here pulls you in almost immediately. And also, I love animals and am the kind of kook who believes all living things deserve a free and happy life. So he had me at “small baby mouse.” If you've read any of Mishka's past work or follow him online, you know well of his struggles – struggles that aren't really in the past but that he manages with grace every single day. The seeming self-hatred that led him into alcoholism doesn't disappear when the drinking stops, and he is brave about revealing how it impacts his decisions, his relationships and his ability to give and receive love. This story is about a mouse, and a family, and a very human man who tries to reconcile what he believes about himself with what the rest of the world believes about him. The tiny mouse he finds under a pile of brush causes him to begin questioning his decision to avoid having children of his own. In caring for and loving a very small life, he better understands the depth of loving something for which he is entirely responsible. It’s a big challenge, bigger even when you are painfully aware of your own shortcomings. The story is interwoven with flashbacks to his upbringing, his relationship with his friends and family, and his endearing interactions with his young nieces and nephews, who all seem to be excellent people and also hilarious. He writes about some of the fears we all share, and how we can disappoint ourselves or loved ones in ways we don’t always understand. That relatability is what makes this an excellent read and an absorbing look into the life of someone who struggles with challenges I hope to never face.", "id": "2"}

{"review": "\"Of Mice and Me\" by Mishka Shubaly is the best read I've come across this summer. Ironically, it is the shortest (and cheapest!) story I've bought in 2014. So it is only apropos that Shubaly's story is steeped in the delicious irony of life...irony that often forces us to question ourselves, our capabilities, and the things that are thrust upon us without our control. It is chock-full of symbolism derived entirely from reality; nothing within these pages comes across as a farce or an obvious jab at being sentimental. This is raw. This is fresh. This is real. The story is simple in its premise - Shubaly comes across a tiny mouse and must nurture him to health. Throughout his care, he develops an attachment to the mouse, an attachment that he soon comes to realize stands for much, much more. Anybody who has dared to explore the dungeons of their brain will find Shubaly's words eerily comforting. Anybody who has stood by, watching their friends and family tackle \"life\" will find Shubaly's anecdotes refreshing. Anybody who has ever feared to love will read \"Of Mice and Me\" and walk away mended. Mr. Shubaly, thank you for your words - for your candor - and for sharing this story with us. Thank you for reminding us of the innocence and beauty of life and for reminding us that in order to love, we must first love and accept ourselves.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Mishka Shubaly is a talented writer. I've read all of his singles and this is one of my favorites. I was emotionally drawn in to Mishkalito's struggle for survival. Shubaly's writing style is fluid and entertaining, full of great wit and subtle ironies that highlight his proto-hipster origins(He was a Brooklynite before Williamsburg was gentrified). In the story, Mishkalito's struggle for existence mirrors Mishka's (the man) emotional development as he matures in his mid-thirties and questions what post-twenties life has to offer him. The story easily stands alone based on it's merits, but it has further depth if you read Mishka's entire catalog of singles. I am continually impressed by the honesty, vulnerability, and self-discovery that Shubaly relates in his work. After reading all of his works, you feel as though you have walked with him through his deepest struggles, self-actualizing through a tumultuous path that left many of his peers dead or in jail. I want to celebrate Mishka's success with him, it takes an incredible amount of drive to go from being an anonymous drunk to a sober ultra-marathoner; let alone a best selling author! Let's hope that through reading his stories, some of his tenacity will rub off.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Finally Mishka Shubaly writes about a topic I'm interested in! Usually Mishka takes me deep inside something I'm not particularly familiar with, like addiction, marathons, or drinking my own urine. But this time he writes about something I know a lot more about than he does: parenthood. But of course his experiences in thinking about being a parent are a lot different than mine, and it was fun to read about his awkward coming to terms with his own potential parenthood. Humorous boy-men are a common theme in movies these days (e.g., any movie directed by Judd Apatow) but Mishka distinguishes himself here by being both funny and human while exploring his issues regarding becoming an adult. As always, his writing is very engaging and I had a hard time putting this down. I'm anxious to read whatever he writes next.", "id": "2"}

A really great read and it seems our little Mishka is growing up. A really fluid read and evokes great visuals and emotions. It was if I was watching a movie in my head.

Anyone who has ever faced the fear of loving or being loved will relate profoundly to Of Mice and Me which, if we were all to be as bluntly and courageously honest as Shubaly himself, would be all of us.

{"review": "This is a well-written account of Genghis Khan and his successors, the Mongols who conquered an amazing chunk of real estate. Weatherford debunks the nonsense about \"millions\" killed in cities of 100,000, and so forth, and correctly notes a lot of this came from Mongol propaganda intended to scare people into submission. The best thing in the book, to my taste, is Weatherford's own knowledge from anthropological on-the-ground research. He knows the steppe and the feel of a Mongol horse under him. He can thus get a real perspective on how the Mongols actually experienced the world (like the great old-timers--Pozdnyev, Curtin--but unlike many modern Mongolists). Next best is his proper crediting of the Mongols for introducing new knowledge all over Eurasia--gunpowder and printing and much else to Europe, Greco-Persian-Arab medicine and foodways to China. The worst is his inattention to detail. He makes some astonishing errors. Some reviewers have picked out a few. He retails the old chestnut (reportedly from a romantic novel) that the Mongols introduced noodles from China to Europe. No, Europe had them 800 years earlier. Worse is his repeating (p. 87) the old nonsense about the Mongols eating raw meat warmed between their thighs and the horses' backs. This factoid was spun by Ammianus Marcellinus, talking about steppe nomads centuries before the Mongols. It was almost certainly wrong then, and it is quite certainly wrong for the Mongols. The Mongols had the good sense to avoid raw meat, especially dirty raw meat. So, read with caution. If this book whets your appetite, the next step is the books by Paul Ratchnevsky (on Genghis) and Morris Rossabi (on his successors and their world). And you might even tackle the Secret History, now made available (though expensive) by the indefatigable Igor de Rachewilz, who is properly acknowledged by Weatherford.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "When Genghis Khan and his armies exploded out of the steppe in the early thirteenth century, no one on the Eurasian continent was prepared for his innovative style of warfare. Through years of what was essentially civil war, the Mongols of that period, as well as the surrounding tribes, had already refined various elements of shock warfare. But Temujin - Genghis Khan's birth name - added much to the Mongols' arsenal that was previously missing. He integrated surrounding tribes into his Mongol army; he ensured looting was strictly controlled and that shares of it were divided on a pre-assigned basis; he killed off the aristocracies of the tribes, cities, and empires he defeated, thereby ensuring they would not rally their people to turn on him at a later time; he organized his armies, and even his society, through a decimal system that smoothed the functioning of his eventual empire; he instituted laws that even he, a great khan, must obey. What resulted from these innovations was unprecedented: an army with the same benefits of speed and maneuver that had always been a part of the traditional tactics of the tribes of the steppe melded together with an effective bureaucratic leadership that was very different from the typical kin-based and ad hoc tribal relationships. This was Temujin's creation, and he perfected it in numerous battles to unify Mongolia under his leadership. In 1206, two years after the final battle to assume control of all Mongolia, he took the name Genghis Khan, and prepared to take his army out into the world. Jack Weatherford's remarkable narrative of these events captures the creativity of Genghis Khan and the Mongols in a way that no book I've read before ever has. Whereas most histories of the Mongols have long emphasized their unprecedented success in war, Weatherford builds a solid case that shows the social and economic achievements of the Mongols may have been even more remarkable than their adaptations to warfare. The author makes the argument that the Mongols were fairly civilized by the standards of the thirteenth century, almost never engaging in torture, mutilation, or maiming. While they were quick to kill, and left an unprecedented path of destruction in their path, especially to those who resisted their rule, conquest and loot were their goals, not gratuitous death and injury. After making himself the undisputed ruler of the steppes, an area about the size of Western Europe, Genghis Khan began moving south and west, conquering the Jurched (Manchurian) tribes ruling Northern China and the kingdom of Khwarizm, an empire under the rule of a Turkic sultan that stretched from what is modern Afghanistan to the Black Sea. Khwarizm was an important catch, as the Muslims there were noted for their steel- and glass-making, as well as numerous exotic commodities. As each conquest was assimilated, Genghis Khan took what was special and distinctive about the place and employed it productively. Craftsmen, miners, artisans, interpreters, and specialists in warfare were all absorbed into the Mongol Empire and tasked according to their specialty. The Mongols were nomads, but the genius of Genghis Khan was to recognize the value of even the smallest and most foreign of civilized talents and to use it to his empire's advantage. Genghis Khan died in 1227 - a mere sixteen years after he began his world conquest. With the exception of India and China, he had conquered everything he set his mind to. It would now be up to his sons and their children to finish what in the shortness of time he could not. (Genghis Khan dies about halfway through Weatherford's book, leaving plenty of space to write about the continued expansion of the empire.) Interestingly, the empire seems to have expanded more by the momentum of its founder's achievements, even after his death, than by the skill of his heirs. Genghis Khan had always been careful not to give his children too much power, as he sought to break away from the traditional kin-based ties of the steppe in order to more smoothly run his empire. In mediating disputes involving his sons, he sometimes took the side of non-kin against them. Until late in his life, he neglected their training as leaders. The consequences of this became immediately apparent in the actions of his son and first heir to the empire, Ogodei. But, even with sub par and occasionally strife-ridden leadership, the empire continued to expand. Some of the Mongol leaders to follow Genghis Khan were exceptional leaders, while others were not, but the combination of unbeatable virtues in the empire was fixed in a way that it hardly mattered in the first few decades after his death. Nothing outside of the empire could stop it, only enduring struggles from within. As Weatherford details, even as the empire began to split into four quadrants, trade and other imperial activities continued. Two Mongol rulers from separate quadrants could be at war with each other and still allow trade and investments between the sides to continue unmolested. Eventually this relationship would break down, and when it did, it would spell the end of the empire. The Mongols did not create anything. They conquered and looted. And the trade routes needed to move their loot from one part of the empire to another were necessary to keep the empire strong. When those trade routes began to close down, and the economy contracted, the Mongol rulers in each area needed to depend on their local political skills to survive. Some did, but others never made the transition. Weatherford's book is a marvel - the best of more than half-a-dozen histories I have read on the subject. Writing about the Mongols has always been a complex task for two seemingly contradictory reasons. On the one hand, their widespread empire requires a scholar to dig through a variety of source material written by those conquered by the Mongols, which many find daunting; on the other hand, the Mongols themselves were illiterate and secretive, and so their own literature was almost nonexistent and, when found, difficult to understand. Given these odd circumstances, histories on the Mongols are usually hit-and-miss affairs. Scholars tend to be great at explaining some part of the Mongols, but fail to maintain that quality in other areas. Weatherford's extensive experience in Mongolia, researching Genghis Khan and his empire, makes up for what he loses by not going to the source material outside of English; his accomplishment is a narrative of the highest order.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This is a revisionist history (isn't it all?) of a truly remarkable figure, who created an empire greater even than the Romans, and he did it from scratch in just a few decades. He was a law-giver who essentially outlawed the culture he came from--transforming it from a Scots-like clan of cattle rustlers and raiders, to a monolithic, highly disciplined cavalry of conquerers. He devised entirely new military tactics that were as successful against the cities of the Chinese as against the armored knights of the West. And they started out as a people, he claims, who did not even know how to weave cloth! Weatherford here takes up the challenge of accenting the positive impact of his brutal conquests. Among other things he makes the case for his setting the West up for the Renaissance, the introduction of paper money, the postal system, Religious tolerance, and new vegetables. He bases much of this on new scholarship, rather than the hysterical propaganda of the aristocrats whom he threatened. Partly based on the mysterious \"Secret History of the Mongols,\" the author's own travels in Mongolia, and contacts with Mongolian revivalists, he makes this bit of history accessible even to the most prejudiced reader. Strangely omitted, though, is the fascinating tale that the geneticists have discovered about his Y chromosome, which appears to show that he might just have been the most prolific lover in the last couple of millennia! Too recent, maybe. One of the remarkable features of his style was that he hated the elite and the aristocrats, and slaughtered as many as he could. He loved the professional men, the teachers and doctors, and especially the craftsmen and engineers, and did not even tax them. My kinda guy! Weatherford's style of writing is lively and easy to read. The maps are just detailed enough to be informative without overburdening the reader in detail. This is not an exhaustive account of every battle, every city destroyed, which would be mind-numbing history as usually written, but rather a wide survey of events and their impact on the world to come. And I especially enjoyed his description of the military tactics employed by the cavalry, and his use of siege engines and gunpowder, which would be new to most readers. Perhaps one of his greatest inventions, though, is that of diplomatic immunity. Any city, and there were several, who murdered or mutilated his envoys as a method of rejecting his terms of surrender, would be ruthlessly razed and the inhabitants slaughtered. Even in those days, the word got around... This is quite a tale, well told.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "For the most part, I enjoyed this book. I discovered a great deal about the Mongols and I believe that the author proves his basic case that the Mongol Empire provided an unprecedented flow of goods and ideas between East and West. Unfortunately, the author is so enthusiastic about promoting the achievements of the Mongols that he often ventures into hyperbole, and worse, miss-statements of fact, especially about the histories of the nations he is comparing to the Mongols. This undercuts his credibility. Some examples: The author's claims that the Mongol invasions introduced wearing trousers in battle to the West. In fact, trousers were popular among the Celts (including the Britons) for thousands of years, as they were among invading \"barbarians\" such as Goths and the Parthians. The Greeks and Romans wore kilts, but many of their neighbors wore trousers long before the Mongols. The author says that in World War II, the Red Army was imitating the Mongol tactic of feigned retreat when they \"lured\" the German army deep into Russia to destroy it. In fact, Stalin repeatedly ordered his generals to stand fast and not give an inch. The reason the Red Army repeatedly fell back was because they were repeatedly beaten. This is not an esoteric point. How could a professor writing history on a global scale not know this? The author says that the last Mogul Emperor's sons were executed in India so that Queen Victoria could take the Imperial title. This is just plain silly. The Emperor himself was sent into exile with other family members. His sons were executed for their purported roles in the Sepoy Rebellion as part of a bloody reprisal. There is no evidence that the motivation for this was to clear the way for Queen Victoria to assume the imperial title -- 20 years later. There are so many more examples of this kind of factual error and false analogy that at times the book feels more like an overheated term paper by a sophomore stretching a point than the product of a learned professor. Such errors make me wonder how much I should trust the author's other pronouncements in areas that I'm not so familiar with. The fact that the author is also prone to needlessly repeat himself doesnt help his case. He cites the fact that his source is the \"Secret History of the Mongols\" so often that I felt like I should be reading that book instead. Maybe I will", "id": "9"}
{"review": "As Strunk and White advise in the classic guide to writing, _The Elements of Style_, \"Do not overstate. When you overstate, readers will be instantly on guard, and everything that has preceded your overstatement as well as everything that follows it will be suspect in their minds because they have lost confidence in your judgment or your poise.\" I wanted to like this book, because I find Genghis Khan and his empire to be fascinating, and yet the author so completely overstates the significance of the Mongols that he loses all credibility, and pollutes an otherwise highly readable and interesting set of facts with so much fiction that it is often difficult to distinguish the two. For example, he claims in the introduction that the Mongols had founded the first unified nations of Korea and China, apparently ignorant of the fact that Korea had been unified since AD 668, and that China was first unified by the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. Similarly, he states on p. 237 that \"[the Renaissance] was not the ancient world of Greece and Rome being reborn: It was the Mongol Empire, picked up, transferred, and adapted by the Europeans to their own needs and culture.\" Although the evidence for Greek and Roman influence on the Renaissance is overwhelming, the evidence for Mongol influence is flimsy at best. The more outsized the claim, the less evidence the author seems to provide. Furthermore, he tries to give the Mongols credit for inspiring Renaissance art, which he calls a hybrid of Eastern and Western styles; he gives the Mongols credit for disseminating Arabic and Indian mathematics (the Arabs themselves had disseminated Indian mathematics throughout the civilized world, long before the Mongols); he gives the Mongols credit for introducing the compass to the West (the compass was mentioned in Alexander Neckham's De Naturis Rerum, written in 1190, before Genghis Khan had even ventured out of Mongolia); and he gives the Mongols credit for inventing the Silk Road, which had already existed for thousands of years. What the book desperately needs are a fact-checker and responsible editor to curb the author's literary excesses. The author clearly sympathizes with the Mongols and wants to promote their case as responsible bearers of civilization. His biases are so blinding, that he frequently makes irrelevant comparisons to the worst excesses of the Catholic Inquisition to try to justify the mass slaughter of the Mongols, and even tries to deny the scale of Mongol genocides altogether, lamely asserting (p. 118), \"It would be physically difficult to slaughter that many cows or pigs, which wait passively for their turn. Overall, those who were supposedly slaughtered outnumber the Mongols by ratios of up to fifty to one. The people could have merely run away, and the Mongols would not have been able to stop them.\" The gigantic flaw in logic is that the Mongols never faced odds of 50-to-1 at any one moment, but rather wiped out city after city in a process that took many years. His claim the the people could \"have merely run away\" is laughable, given his constant reminders that the Mongol cavalry were the fastest and most efficient army of the day. He could just as easily have applied the same ludicrous argument to any other historical genocide in order to deny their scale and seriousness. I still like the subject of Genghis Khan, and Weatherford has whetted my appetite: I may eventually pick up one of the other, more serious and scholarly books on the topic. However, I will never again make the mistake of reading anything written by Mr. Weatherford.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This is a well written, nicely flowing work. The author, Jack Weatherford, traces the life and time of Genghis Khan, born as Temujin, and his descendants. He notes the impact of the plague on the Mongols and how that plague spread, to some extent by the Mongols. And he makes the claim that the Mongols had an appreciable impact on the West's Renaissance. Weatherford begins by noting the purpose of his book (Page xxxv): \"The focus remains on the mission of our work: to understand Genghis Khan and his impact on world history.\" The book is in three parts: first, Genghis Khan's rise to power and the development of the Mongol Empire; second, the period when the Mongols became a major world player, until the empire began devouring itself with internecine warfare; third, the effect of the Mongols on the development of modern society. There is a useful genealogy at the start of the book; however, the book would have benefited greatly with an ample supply of maps, so that the reader could trace developments geographically. The book does a terrific job of describing Khan's background--from his youth until he began developing a powerhouse, to his death. His military forces used innovative tactics that baffled his opponents, adapting Mongol warriors' mobility to advantage. The Mongols expanded their sway until--at its greatest point, it was larger than the Roman Empire at its height. It stretched, in 1260, from China to Moscow and Kiev, and to the doorsteps of Vienna, from Baghdad to Samarkand. Weatherford goes on to discuss the Empire after Genghis Khan's death. It continued to function until the combat among his sons led to more and more internal troubles. This depiction of internal problems, again, is well done. It amazes me how detailed is the discussion of people and events from so long ago. However, when he comes to argue that the Mongol Empire sparked the Renaissance and later European history, It appears to me that his grasp exceeds his reach. I am not certain that quoting Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" with references to Genghis Khan (as part of his argument) is compelling. Nonetheless, while I did not find his case so convincing, it did cause me to reflect on important historical issues, and that--in itself--is a contribution. In short, a well done book on the Mongol Empire and its founder. Worth taking a look at. . . .", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Like most authors on this subject matter, WEATHERFORD focused his research of the Mongol military campaigns in the Middle East and the brief but devastating incursion in Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, he too, like other authors, lacked sufficient research on the Chinese campaign, which ended in 1279 under Kublai, and was the lengthiest of all Mongol military campaigns. He also misinterpreted the Chinese campaign in more ways than one, and provided little information in terms of the political interactions between China and Mongolia during the 13th century. The most destructive episode of medieval warfare occurred not in Europe, the Middle East, or the Crusades, but in China proper of the 1200s. Although initiated by Genghis, the Mongol-China War did not end until the reign of Kublai. The campaign included the greatest siege in pre-modern military history, where the fall of the fortified city of Xiangyang in 1273 served as a turning point of the Mongol-China war, and ended with the capitulation of the Sung Dynasty six years later (WEATHERFORD placed a three month siege by the Mongols as being protracted, yet he dismissed the fact that the siege of Xiangyang had lasted six years). Not surprisingly, the campaign drained vast amounts of resources, and millions of lives. The Mongol's China campaign also marked the very first time in history where guns, cannons & other types of firearms were used extensively. Yet, this event in history was ignored by WEATHERFORD, as he focused on the administrative reforms of Yuan China over previous Chinese dynasties, but not the military campaigns that made the reforms possible. WEATHERFORD also ignored the episode of alliance between Southern Sung and the Mongols as they warred against the Northern Chinese dynasties, the Xi-Xia and Jin. Kublai did not complete the conquest of China out of personal ambitions alone. Rather, with the fall of Xi-Xia and Jin, the Sung Dynasty remained a looming threat to the Mongols. As the Sung continue to demand territories and other compensations, the Mongols had every reason to be cautious of a potential Sung attack from the rear. Kublai had to endure extensive campaigns to subdue northern India, South Asia, even launching an invasion against Japan to completely isolate and eventually terminate any supply and/or trade routes the Song Dynasty possessed. All these efforts were considered necessary in order to subjugate then the most powerful empire on Earth, an empire that accounted for 80% of the world's GDP! In another blunt assumption, WEATHERFORD suggested that literacy amongst the Chinese were restricted to government officials and gentries. But in fact, China boasted the most flexible system of social mobility and the most sophisticated bureaucracy in the world during the Middle Ages. The Chinese bureaucracy never imposed a system to limit literacy amongst the peasantry. Whenever given an opportunity, peasant families sent their sons to private academies for an education. Technologies such as block printing also encouraged the distribution of written materials, thus promoting literacy. Voluntary civil examinations across China would then act as a measure of talent amongst learned peoples, where the chosen few are ranked and stationed in bureaucratic posts according to their skill. It is not surprising to find many Chinese officials with humble beginnings. Moreover, WEATHERFORD seemed to imply the rise & subsequent popularity of Peking opera was due to Mongol administration. In fact, the rise of Peking opera was due to educated Chinese having no place to utilize their skills because the Mongols had abandoned civil examination & post selection altogether. Thus one of the few venues for learned men was writing opera scripts and other literature to vent their frustration against the government! WEATHERFORD also wrote that the Chinese were `amazed' at some of the qualities of their enemies in a tone as to suggest that the Chinese were somehow `unfamiliar' with the Mongols. There is nothing further from the truth. The annals of Chinese military history indicated frequent warfare against the Nomads to the North. As early as the Qin Dynasty (221 BC - 207 BC), expeditions were directed against the Huns (ancestors to the Mongols) with notable successes achieved in later Han (202 BC - 220 AD) and Tang (618 AD - 907 AD) dynasties. Conflicts between the Chinese and Mongols continued until the last Imperial Dynasty of China, the Qing (1616 AD - 1912 AD). Among all Mongol rivals, the Chinese Empire had the most familiarity with the Mongols, and nominally best prepared for war against them. No wonder Genghis Khan, upon his deathbed, would instruct his descendants to complete the conquest of China, as his last will on Earth.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Let me start with what I liked about this book. It sums up the two centuries in which Mongols made their mark on the world in a readable, digestible and informative way. Jack Weatherford is an anthropologist so the strongest parts are the first few chapters dealing with Chinggis Khan's tribal origins, his childhood and rise to power. Weatherford apparently spent lots of time in Mongolia, researching Mongol history on the spot and the first half of the book shows that. It describes the steppe life well, provides many interesting details and is just generally fun to read. Sometimes, Weatherford can even be outright funny. But in the second half, the book clearly turns for the worse. Once Mongols leave their homeland and become players in world politics, the book has to become less anthropology and more history and that's clearly not Jack Weatherford's forte. He posits all sorts of causal links which sound either dubious or plain ridiculous (Mongols inspired European renaissance, Columbus sailed to America to search for the Mongol empire etc.). Yet what I found especially inappropriate (and at times almost laughable) was how the author pushes hard to teach us important MORAL lessons through Mongol conquest. For instance, the Catholic Church tortured heretics (as Weatherford often stresses - even in the middle of a passage on the Mongol court, there is an aside about European inquisition) but Chinggis khan never tortured - he killed straight away. What a moral giant! On page 105, we learn that, had it not been for the recalcitrant emir of Bukhara who refused to submit without a fight, Chinggis would have lived out his days \"in peace, enjoying his family and horses.\" See, he was a family man! His ultimate moral point is to fit Mongol conquests in the framework of the eternal struggle between sedentary and nomadic populations and his moral axis is clearly one where sedentary=evil, nomadic=good. Notice, in the following passage, how the blame for aggression subtly shifts as the author cites the cases to support his point: \"[The struggle of the hunter and herder against farmer] ... was a history as old as the story of the Bedouin tribes that followed Muhammad to smash the pagan idolatry of the city, of the Roman campaigns against the Huns, of the Greeks against the wandering Scythians, of the city dwellers of Egypt and Persia who preyed on the wandering tribes of Hebrew herders, and, ultimately, of Cain, the tiller, who slew his brother Abel, the herder.\" (p.266) So there you have it: Chinggis khan was really waging a defensive war against \"the civilized children of Cain, who eternally encroached upon the open lands of the tribes\" (p.267). How the Polish peasants encroached upon the uncultivable Mongol homelands in the Gobi desert is unclear to me, but Chinggis khan & Sons sure made them pay for it at the battle of Legnica in 1241, as Weatherford relates with glee. So, is this book worth the money? The first half is; the second half - read it with a skeptical, cynical, distrustful mind.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Fascinating book, and prior reviewers have summarized it well. My only comment is that Weatherford eulogizes him far too often. His accomplishments came at the expense of those he conquered. Lest we forget.... An army of 200,000 men does not move without supplies across 2,000 miles without living off the local population, for example. Massacre of the ruling class was considered barbaric in the 13th century, but it certainly made his takeover of Pakistan and Turkey simple. His descendents' methods were the inspiration of Nazi Germany, down to their ludicrous adoption of the swastika, for example. Other than that, it is extremely well written and entertaining.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Jack Weatherford's book is written as if he himself was a Mongol, but he was not. He takes a close look at the impact of Genghis Khan without the distortion of the western or middle eastern eyes and views. Every other book on the Mongols view them as a destructive force with no influence to the history of mankind. However, the author proves this wrong. If you can be objective about history and do your due deligence and accept another's viewpoint, this is a must read. He presents Genghis Khan's legacy as it should be presented. Influences of Genghis Khan: (military: only force to defeat the Russians in winter, something Napoloean and the German could not do; fought the German Knights, the Assasins in the Middle East and the Japanese. All of the 3 did not even know that the other countries existed. Succeeded where the Crusaders could not. Developed the lightning attack at multiple fronts, used psychological warfare, and implemented new military technologies and was quick to adapt to different terrains of the countries he fought in. He promoted officers for their deeds and not for their heritage. (not just military) - he was tolerent of all religions, his sons began a system of free education, he abhorred tortue, recognized international immunity, separated the church from the state, established paper currency, promoted free trade by exchanging ideas and goods across his empire, pushed for the creation of cartograpghy, developed a postal system, and his son's encouraged trade across his empire via sea routes. Some words used today - Hooray and Satin are of Mongol origin. Yes, some of Genghis Khan's impact was cruel but he lived in times of harsh cruelty, even Princes, Kings, Sultan's, Caliph's of his time exhibited even more harsh judgements. For all readers - Mongols to really identify with your heritage and not to forget, and those who are not mongol but who are interested in this lost treasure of history that the author rediscovered in an unabiased and simple explanations, this book is highly worth reading.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Why read \"Wild: from Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\"? In a nutshell, because Cheryl Strayed is brutally honest about her weaknesses as well as her strengths, because she writes magnificently, and because she speaks for so many women who have suffered similar insults and assaults and have never had such an articulate writer to tell their story. Her first twenty-six years constitute a life often lived but rarely told. The hundred days before her twenty-seventh birthday make up the substance of the \"Lost to Found\" journey within a journey -- the unifying theme of this book, a theme of personal confrontation and self-willed rebirth in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. If you are able to read even the Prologue you will see evidence of Strayed's unique voice. If that is unavailable and you're still on the fence as to whether to buy this book, I urge you to go to cherylstrayed.com and read some of Strayed's essays. Perhaps her raw honesty will seize hold of you as it did me and give you no choice but to get the book. This is not to say that everyone will love this book or its author. Readers will respond very differently. Some will be as enthusiastic as the 5-star reviewers and some as unimpressed as the 3-star (there are no lower reviews at this point, which is a testament to the books' quality). Strange as it may seem, I see the perspectives of those who are enthusiastic and those who are dissatisfied and believe that both the accolades and the criticisms are legitimate. It is a sign of considerable courage to hike 1,100 miles alone, while it is a sign of great weakness to wallow in personal sorrow while toying with drugs and ruining a marriage. Before I saw Amazon's listing, I had not heard of Strayed although she clearly already has a following. It was, however, not the author but the subject matter -- a woman's solo journey over 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail - that first attracted me to the book. But do not be misled. This book is not a hiker's guide. Two of the mistakes Strayed made are as basic as can be: wearing shoes a size too small and carrying an overweight pack. Many pages are devoted to Strayed's complaints about these two major errors and the pain and injuries they caused to her body. Hard as long-distance hiking is, one need not be impaired by shoes that cause most of your toenails to fall off and a pack that is more than half your body weight. Rather than a guide, this is a memoir. Strayed's qualities are not common sense or preparedness. Her work is of great value because she confronts and reveals parts of herself that others would deny and hide. In her childhood she was seriously damaged by violence and neglect and yet nurtured within herself a spirit so indomitable and a talent so unusual that she has been able to pull herself through terrible hardship to a place of personal transcendence and victory. She confronted the damage done to herself by her violent and absent biological father, the abandonment imposed by her mother's untimely and painful death, and the destruction wrought at her own hand when she repeatedly cheated on her husband and became involved with heroin. This is not a cautionary tale. The author was already living a life of extraordinary and unnecessary risk before she ever took a single step on the PCT. Her heroin use and eagerness to be intimate with strangers surely were as life-threatening as the rattlesnakes and bears she eventually met up with on the PCT. So it was not the danger of the trail that captivated me. Rather, it was the fact that almost everyone Strayed met on the trail was kind, interesting, and generous. My guess is that the PCT attracts unusual people who have more than the usual amount of kindness and gentleness in their souls. Or maybe Strayed just brings out those qualities in people. She surely comes across as a warm, open, easy-going person. This is not to say that the people Strayed met were universally good. Two bowhunters stand out as particularly offensive and potentially dangerous. That Strayed was able to avoid being brutalized by them is further testament to the quickness of her insight and the strength of her personality. Few have Strayed's courage to live their own truth and to tell that truth without wavering. She is remarkable as a person and as a writer. If you are willing to travel with a damaged woman who puts herself in harms way and tells about it with raw honesty, who looks at herself without blinking, and who emerges from her daunting journey with greater insight and wisdom, you want to read Wild.", "id": "2"}

{"review": "I had mixed reactions to this book. As a disclaimer, I would like to point out that I am not in the target audience for this book. I am 58 and male. I read the book because I am a backpacker. The book sells mostly to young, slim (probably athletic) women. Why do I make this assertion? I went to Cheryl Strayed's event and book-signing. 95% of the large audience (Ms. Strayed is a rock star) fit this target market. The other 5% probably came for the electronic, new-age musician. If I were in the target market, if I had identified more strongly with Ms. Strayed (or her 24-year old self), I would probably have loved this book. If you can identify with Cheryl Strayed, then you may love this book. If you cannot form this bond, you may dislike the book because of the follow reasons: 1. The language and metaphors are fairly pedestrian. I kept thinking, I have heard that analogy or phrasing in many books (often self-help books, no accident that Ms. Strayed was a self-help columnist). The author usually avoids obvious cliches, but if you reflect upon media discussions that focus on personal growth, you will recognize most of the language. For example, the author loves the adverb, \"profoundly.\" She also uses some obvious tricks to make the writing seem compelling: sexual obscenities (not an objection for me, but more of an author tic) and exaggerating verbs -- \"destroyed\" for tired and \"shattered\" for distraught or depressed. Not terrible, but not Joan Didion or Dave Eggers. 2. Cheryl Strayed likes metaphor as the primary tool in story-telling (call it approach A). She made this comment in the event that I attended. Many authors, however, focus upon precise, sensory detail to show depth of character, point of view, voice and story development. For these authors (call this approach B), focusing upon metaphor creates overwrought story-telling. Approach B is not a law (no laws in story-telling). I, however, like approach B. If you like approach A, then read the book. To be fair, the author did use a lot of good detail, but it was not the primary driver for the story. 3. Almost all of the flashbacks to Strayed's last few years (of her drug-use, frantic-sex, relationship-destroying period) were linked to the on-the-trail narrative through metaphor. In addition to liking approach A, Strayed did not have much chance to really reflect or think about her mental or social problems on the trail. As she wrote, she was surviving -- wrestling with some incredible discomforts or worrying about some big problems (enough water or possibly woman-eating mountain lions). To weave her recent life problems into the narrative, Strayed, the writer, needed her thematic or metaphorical links. For example, coming upon a long, snowed-over section of the trail gives her an image and loose theme (snow and hardship) to write about how she had to shoot her beloved horse in the snow to euthanize the poor creature. That description would have stood better on its own; it was perhaps the most powerful mini-story in the book. It did not gain as a flashback from her trail problems. Moreover, the trail flow was broken unnecessarily by the horse story. She switched back and forth, through metaphor, repeatedly. Chopping up the PCT trail narrative this extensively diffused the trail tension. The metaphors were not strong or original enough to overcome the structural problems. If you, however, feel a deep, powerful identification with the author, this structural point will probably not be a problem for you. 4. While focusing upon metaphor, the author avoids some obvious problems and explanations: Her pre-trail use of heroin ballooned into an almost daily habit for months. People become strongly addicted when using heroin at this frequency. Ms. Strayed never mentions withdrawal after stopping the habit almost cold-turkey. If she had suffered withdrawal, it would have been a horrific experience. Why did she avoid mentioning that issue? Likewise, when she takes a serious fall, dropping down a rocky trail with her impossible-to-carry pack, she writes about the aftermath as if she had suffered a painful but superficial knee-scrape. Reality check: when I have suffered falls that severe on a trail, I have torn ligaments or cartilage, effectively ending my trip. It seems that Cheryl Strayed is blessed with extremely good luck after a number of ordinarily crippling events (high frequency injections of street heroin, falling hard down rocks with a 50 lbs. backpack crushing her, almost getting raped by some lunatic, getting her feet so blistered that most skin peeled off...). Are all the escapes and endurance-of-crippling-pain possible? Yes. If you are a Navy Seal. Memory is subjective, and any of us can enhance a story from repeated retelling. 5. The author's pre-trail behavior (extreme impulsiveness) fits borderline personality disorder (BPD). This impulsiveness suggests much more than just Strayed's explanation -- grief. Grief could have triggered this mental illness, but not explained it. I can understand that Strayed did not want to crimp her character's possibilities with a psychiatric diagnosis. BPD, however, is a serious and real mental illness, and its treatment almost always means a much longer ordeal than a three month hike. Although a three month wilderness journey can be life-changing, it is almost never a cure for serious mental illness. Again, the author endures almost unbelievable mental and physical hardship, and never slows in her forward motion. Finally, what kept me reading was not the description of the wilderness (which was interesting), but rather my curiosity about how Cheryl Strayed would tie together all of her themes and potential solutions. She did it, characteristically, with some metaphors. (Crater Lake was a mountain with a heart torn out, that eventually healed -- like her.) As far as how she got herself together enough to stop life-threatening impulsiveness: inexplicable trail-magic transformed her -- somehow loosening the grief inside of her. (She wrote that the trail was not just a journey outside, but more of a journey inside. I think of literary types advising: show, don't tell. The words \"inside\" and \"outside\" are lackluster figures of speech and poor substitutes for \"showing\" descriptions of the internal or external.) I came away thinking that Strayed was waving some magic wands of metaphor, and not telling the whole story -- perhaps in many ways. The Kindle format -- one final point: The quotes from literature under the section headings on my Kindle (a new, basic version) are garbled. These same quotes in the print version are right justified, and are readable. The quotes in the Kindle version are crushed as a one-character column on the right margin and continue, scrambled, for multiple pages. They are unreadable. Amazon and readers need to do something about shoddy publishing products. We are paying $12.99 for this e-book. Readers need to demand more -- have an old iPad for example to buy a clean version if it is available. Also, protest when publishers deliver this crap.

But as true memoir, I have difficulty believing this isn't another \"no, really, I swear that's what happened!\" kind of story, where Oprah will soon air a condemning reveal of all that was flourished or outright fictionalized in the telling. The story vacillates from the difficult to believe to the extremely repetitive, and sometimes manages to be both at once: how many times do we need to hear big, strong men tell her how heavy her pack is? Or how pretty she is? How many grueling, life-threatening walks need to be described before we know just how brave and crazy this was? I found myself rolling my eyes on several occasions, and wanting to skim the details through many others. I adored \"Eat, Pray, Love\" and am a big fan of the \"redemptive memoir\" genre, but here I found myself liking and trusting the author's voice less and less as I read on. Finally, in my opinion, the last chapter is a total cop-out (spoiler alert - don't read further if you don't want to know how the book ends). She touches the Bridge of the Gods, and next thing we know, all her intimacy issues have been resolved, and it's 9 years into a stable marriage to a wonderful, wonderful man, wonderful kids and a wonderful life. The notion that punishing physical activity is the panacea for psychic suffering is absurd and possibly dangerous. Such a journey can be a source of strength and esteem, but being alone in one's head while ripping one's feet to bloody shreds is not a reliable path to resolving childhood abandonment and mistrust of/intimacy issues with men.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Cheryl Strayed had her life fall apart when she was still in her mid 20's- personal disasters, tragedies, poor life decisions. Her Mother had just died painfully from cancer, she was dabbling in drugs, she divorced her husband, no decent job, no money- and even more bad things. She then made a courageous and unusual decision- to solo through hike the Pacific Crest Trail, from the Mojave desert to the Washington border (in this case about 1100 miles, as she didn't hike through Washington, and parts of the trail were snowed under and considered impassable). This is a grueling trip that makes even hardened trail fanatics think twice, but the author set off on her trip with a minimum of experience. Now, being a hiker of some experience (but never having attempted a through hike of the PCT), I was reading this book more about her hiking experiences and misadventures. Interspersed with her trail story are many back-flashes to her personal history, including mostly the tragedies and poor life decisions. I am sure these will be of primary interest to others. It would seem madness to set off on a hike like this with your life in complete shambles. But, if you have ever gone deep into the wilderness on a solo hike, you can see the method in her madness. Once you get a few days into your trip, it is a HUGE life-changing experience. You will never look at Life the same way again. You are Alone- but also feel a part of nature, so you don't feel lonely. Your \"huge personal problems\" drop away, while you grapple with immediate issues such as blisters, drinking water, hunger and rattlesnakes. Those suffering from sleep problems find those go away like magic about two nights in. Now, yes, this is a \"personal journey\" \"soul changing\" \" heal-myself memoirs\" book, and that's the theme. But besides that, it's also a pretty good book to read so that you don't make her mistakes if you decide to set off on a trip like this yourself. Don't worry, you'll make plenty of others, and certainly minor misadventures are what make the trip interesting. I don't know if you need 1000 miles to change your life. But a week or two may well do it. Fascinating, a real-page turner.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I remember the words well from a friend who had seen the Hannabel Lector movies: \"Interesting...but I'm not sure you want this in your head.\" Don't get me wrong - Cheryl is a good writer, but her subjects are disturbing. This is not so much a book about hiking the PCT as it is her own catharsis: her father brutalizing her and her family, the death of her mother, her herion addition, and the final straw for me: the graphic murder of a beloved horse (it made me ill). And the hiking of the trail? She's lucky to be alive. Don't take notes. She's ill prepared, and with the aid of strangers, who provide rides, showers and food, she \"makes it\". I was not inspired. Just saddened.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "First things first: Wild is not a memoir of hiking the PCT; it's a memoir of (hopefully) the most troubled period of the author's life, which happens to include a long-distance backpacking trip on the PCT. Therefore, if you're looking for a memoir that focuses on nature, hiking, or backpacking, this probably isn't for you. (However, if you're looking for examples of how NOT to prepare for a long-distance backpacking trip, Wild certainly provides plenty of that!) In her early/mid-twenties, the author experiences a personal tragedy (the death of her mother) that sends her on a downward spiral of self-destruction. The lack of family support and a less-than-ideal childhood only exacerbate the problem by not providing her with the stability and tools to cope, especially during what is traditionally an unstable, transitional period of life anyway. However, it's obvious that a lot of her problems are her own doing. She pushes away an unconditionally loving and supportive husband who was probably the most stable person she'd ever had in her life. She has a relationship with a heroin addict who gets her hooked, too, but she is reluctant to break it off. Unprotected sex with the addict leads to a pregnancy that ends in abortion. Unfortunately, she doesn't disclose any emotions or thoughts regarding the actual abortion itself, and we don't find out how she got off heroin - both struggles that would have added to the book. She is woefully unprepared for a long-distance backpacking trip, which creates misery for her: unnecessary gear leads to a heavy pack that causes abrasions and scars; she's unconditioned and, thus, struggles to achieve her estimated daily mileage; her boots are too small, causing her constant pain. The author organizes what becomes, quite frankly, the brutal murder of her mother's beloved horse because she couldn't be bothered to scrounge up the money for humane euthanasia. The horse unnecessarily meets an excruciating, violent death; the action was thoughtless, cruel, and disgraceful. (Hell, if she had called around to some vets to let them know what the alternative was, someone would've done it for free or at cost.) This incident causes the author a lot of anguish (though it pales next to what the horse went through), but it was she who caused it. I'm not sure that the author ever gains the self-awareness to realize that she is the cause of so much of her own pain, a lesson that would have greatly strengthened the book. Some reviewers dismiss the book based upon judgements of the author's character: a whiny, irresponsible young woman who engages in casual sex and drug use. Yes, that's an accurate description. But hey, she was in her early/mid-twenties at the time, and everyone made bad choices when they were young. Plus, responsibility and morals are things that have to be instilled in a young person; if they're not, they are slow to acquire on one's own. She obviously had no one around to teach her such things and, therefore, had to learn them on her own. The biggest fault in this book is that we never know what the author learned or even if she learned anything at all. The ending is unsatisfying and abrupt; her journey ends, but how is she changed? We never really find out. Years later with her husband and children, the author revisits the spot where she ended her journey. Apparently, she managed to find happiness and stability, but we're not told how she went from that still messed-up young woman who hiked the PCT in the mid-90s to a woman who seems to have gotten her life together. It's a shame. I appreciate that the author ultimately triumphed by completing her journey and overcoming her fears of the trail. I was engaged by the accounts of her experiences on (and off) the trail, though they are superficial. While I felt that Wild was an enjoyable read, I don't find it to be the inspiring tale that it aspires to be. Quite simply, the author never shows the reader that she has learned and grown either by experiencing hardships on the trail or by reflecting on her past experiences and actions. The reflection, understanding, and acquisition of self-awareness that would lead one \"from lost to found\" is unfortunately absent from the book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I finally bought this book because I had seen the name topping the Non-Fiction Best Seller list for so long that I thought it would be a lovely evocative story of hiking and camping on the Pacific Coast Trail, burnishing the memories I have of the times in the very late 1940s and the 1950s when my late wife and I would be packed in to Kings Canyon National Park to spend a week of our vacation - first with friends and then much later with our children - hiking and camping, isolated, beside a lake or a stream in the High Sierras. Those memorable moments in the high mountains are indescribable. The pure air, the absolute silence, the immensity, the trees, the breathtaking brilliance of the canopy of stars at night, the aloneness. No phones. No papers, no schedule, no people - none - except your hiking and camping companions. Companionship around a campfire in the enfolding darkness before a night in your warm sleeping bag - and then a cold dawn, washing in cold, cold water, building the morning fire and the first cup of good hot coffee. Ah! I thought I might relive it all - or at least some delicious part of it - through Ms. Strayed's prose. But it was not to be. This book is a carefully designed literary event. Yes, Ms. Strayed tells us about her two plus months in 1995 hiking the Pacific Coast Trail from Mohave in the Sierras through the Cascades and finally to the Bridge of The Gods over the Columbia at Portland. It's an agonizing hike - her boots were new, never broken in and too small, her pack was way too heavy; she was a tenderfoot in every way - and if there is one consistent theme in this book it is how her feet - blistered, bleeding, bruised - hurt every hour of every day and night. She had absolutely no previous hiking or camping experience and she was hiking alone - foolhardy and an absolute no-no. She was lucky to have made the trip and live to tell about it. No, the hike is not the story; and having said that I'm not just sure what her story is if there is one. She was 22 when she made the hike and was or had been an insecure, live-for-the-moment girl, experimenting with drugs (heroin), men (many), marriage and life itself. Her home life had been unhappy and she had just experienced the tragic death of her mother at 50 from cancer as well as a new divorce from a husband she still loved (kind of). So there was every reason for her to go to the mountains to heal, to \"find herself\". That's not the story either, but it's certainly a big - if not the larger - part of it. Every few pages she careens off the trail of her hiking story to give us several more pages of flashback on her many problems in the life she had led, the problems that finally brought her to the hike. As a matter of fact there are more pages about her troubles than her hike; and she never really appreciates the beauty of where she was. Frankly I'm a bit tired of writers telling us what a tough time they had growing up and how they were redeemed - or redeemed themselves - one way or another - their theory being, I guess, that the greater the troubles the louder we cheer the redemption. All of us have troubles - very often big troubles - but we find redemption in many different ways - through courage, through our friends, our family, professional help or the Church, or through the simple application of wisdom and the benefit of experience - in ways other than by shaking out our troubles in the black and white of print before the reading public. (It's a kind of self hero worship.) But then, too, most of us are not writers; and that is what writers such as Ms. Strayed like to do. Which brings me to my problem with this book. Ms. Strayed made this trip in 1995; the book was published 17 years later - in 2012. But in her book she is telling us in minute-by-minute detail what happened during her long hours on the trail - or off it - and like it happened yesterday. For example, she will tell us exactly what she ate, alone one night in her cold tent in the rain, and what she thought about as she ate- her mother's suicide, her old boyfriend etc. There are long passages - pages and pages of them - of retrospective personal detail, more of them in fact than pages of the details of her actual hike. No one could have kept a journal with so much detail for so long, given the conditions of her hike. Much of her story - if not the majority of it - is therefore fiction based on the memories of what she did 17 years before she put pen to paper - fiction unfortunately dressed up as truth; but such is her privilege because she is first and foremost a writer. She was bookish. She would read, not write. (By my count she read or referred to 14 books, only a few of which she picked up on the way.) She wrote more about the books she was reading than the glorious sights that surrounded her. After the trip she made her living writing for the 17 years that intervened between the trip and this book; and a writer enjoys a wide canvas on which to inscribe his or her thoughts; and she used absolutely all of it So the book is both fiction and non-fiction and memoir - a mélange of all of the above. However, if you are going to read it, forget all this and read it for what it is - a literary event, neither fiction or non fiction, a book based on both truth and memory, written by an accomplished writer as a part of her work as a published author. Believe me, it's a long slog; and when, like Ms. Strayed, I made it to the Bridge of the Gods with her I had had it. I don't want to do it again.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I'll admit it right off the bat, I'm not sure this genre is my cup of tea. I didn't like \"Three Cups of Tea,\" I abhorred \"Eat, Love, Pray\" and I didn't like \"A Million Little Pieces\" one bit. Having said this, I saw that most other reviewers described this book as \"gripping,\" \"compelling,\" and \"heartbreaking\" and I hoped that I would feel the same way when I finished reading \"Wild.\" But, after forging my way through a couple hundred pages, I can only describe this book as monotonous, tedious and emotionally unsatisfying. I wanted to love this book. I wanted to love this author. I wanted to walk beside this woman on her journey of self-discovery and live the emotions she lived, and feel the transformation she was bound to undergo. I wanted to feel her boots on my feet, taste her fears in my mouth, and nod in understanding at each new revelation that came her way. What I found is that I couldn't keep focussed on the story for more than a paragraph at a time. I read, then skimmed, read, then skimmed, hoping to find the well-crafted story I had read so much about. Instead, this book read like a never ending whine fest. If I had to read about the chafing on Ms. Strayed's hips from her overloaded back pack just one more time, I think I would have thrown my iPad out the window. There seemed to be no real arc to the storyline, just one frustrating ordeal after another. If any character transformation occurred, it must have occurred in the last few pages of the book, a long way past where I stopped reading. It is true that Ms. Strayed talked openly and honestly about graphic details of her life, but that didn't connect me to her character in any meaningful way, and without this connection, I didn't care enough about this woman to read on. I trudged and I trudged and I trudged right along beside the author as far as I could go, but eventually I was compelled to toss my metaphorical boots over the edge of a cliff and bring my journey through the pages of Wild to a premature end.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "There seems to be growing popularity with these types of books. Fortunately, this one, well written with great touches of humor and with the author (and main character) someone you don't necessarily always root for, but you always just want to see how the trainwreck ends. While there are other books that are a bit stronger overall, and specifically in the area of tying the \"nature\" part of the memoir to the \"here's my life part\" such as AWOL on the Appalachian Trail, this book does show the strength of the individual and such. In \"Wild,\" there are times in the story that seem conversational with the reader, and it helps quite a bit to draw the reader into the authors life and her feelings about what happened and brought her to The Trail. On the same token, though, a lot of the \"I like to have sex with random guys and heroin is fun, too\" side stories get a little tiring...and Cheryl seems to struggle to tie those elements with her past into the story of the trail; perhaps its because she was actually on the trail nearly a decade ago. Who knows, but regardless, parts of the book sound like a great narrator laying on a couch, answering questions about her past...to her psychologist. Not exactly what you signed up for with this book, somewhat entertaining, but also rather repetitive. Lastly, while the book did come to a somewhat satisfying conclusion, there was really no period of \"enlightening\" that you'd hope for at the end of this type of book. More of \"and that's where I stopped...and now, here's what's going on in my life.\" All in all, she could have eliminated the trail completely, and the story would still be roughly the same, minus a few choice chapters that were specifically about the trail. (Yes, some of the friends and naturally trusting people, etc. would be lessened. Point is: the trail doesn't always connect with the story the author is telling, and there doesn't appear to be a significant attempt to remedy it.) All in all, it was a good book, I'd recommend it (after a couple others, most notably AWOL on the Appalachian), but some elements left the reader hanging or tired of the repetition.", "id": "2"}

She holds nothing back, facing her demons and humiliation head on with not a hint of self pity.

{"review": "This book will be widely read in the coming years. Judy's book is a rare combination; fine writing, a heart-wrenching story, and a salve for the soul of the sensitive. Everyone takes different things from life...a book read, a movie watched, a news article, a chance meeting, a dream. We act and interpret according to our characters and experiences. Sixty years ago (as I write this), my mother was moving into the last 48 hours of her pregnancy with the first of her eleven sons, me. She bore 4 daughters too, and she lies buried within shouting distance of where I sit. She was 47 when she died; killed, I thought for many years, by her Catholic faith, and its fierce hunger for more Catholics. We, her children were left with our own demons. What I took from Judy's book was this: in matters of the heart, of guilt and of shame, of crushing regret, seek not forgiveness from others, turn first to yourself. It is not so much the story of an unwed mother, a teenage pregnancy, a culture of banishing the black sheep lest the neighbours talk (God help us all...how many tears have been shed for the sake of 'what people might think'?); it is a lesson in how to value yourself, how to heal yourself. Judy's long-seeping wound was inflicted by society. To the millions of other Judys of both genders who will read this book, your wounds will not necessarily be from lost children, but, with luck, Judy's simple solution will help you find peace. Her story takes a long time to tell...she will take you to her childhood bedroom, her school, the Rocky Mountains, Big Sur, her subtly skilful writing carrying you through the years right alongside her.

Entrepreneurship is the backbone of our economy, and it offers virtually anyone unlimited opportunity, income, and freedom. But like anything worth pursuing, it requires effort,\" Susan Baroncini-Moe states in her book, \"Business in Blue Jeans - How to Have a Successful Business on Your Own Terms, in Your Own Style.\" This two hundred and thirty page hardbound book is targeted not only toward one who wants to start up a new business venture, it aids in successful growth of an existing business. With a plethora of positive reviews on the back jacket cover and six pages at the beginning of the book, Baroncini-Moe knows strategies and marketing techniques to start or stay in business. After the introduction, the book is separated into six parts that walks the \"newbie\" or existing business owner through starting or revamping their trade. Stating one has \"brain junk\" that stops him or her from being successful, one needs to work on dealing with negativity to get to the next step in business, drawing the line regarding core values that may include politics or religion. Almost every chapter has homework assignments for both novice and veteran, some with her own tried examples yet there are no easy fill-in-the-blank or self-help tests for guidance. At the end there is a six page index and invitation to join her online website for more information. The author describes in detail the fire inside that is based on motivation and inspiration and how to stroke the embers when the fire wanes. Through expertise and packaging, one can learn how to lean into marketing by village networking. As a fan of meditation, she promotes having a \"dream to reality\" book, an inventory of success and a \" plan of whys\" to facilitate finding a happy medium in business to maintain being true to oneself. Correlating a business owner's progress to a kitchen sink, she concentrates on keeping time journals, knowing explicit target markets, having a ten focus group, and brainstorming with peers. By getting the reader to write out detailed thoughts, dreams, goals and expectations in each chapter regarding his or her business, no doubt one will be more tuned in to its successes, improvements and future direction.

No one goes it alone, but you have to start with yourself\" he says. Throughout the book Treu makes explicit the practices he uses for effective networking that effective networkers often practice implicitly. He shares his successes as well as his failures in networking. A key to his effectiveness appears to be his genuine care and concern for others. THIS IS A MUST READ! BUY THIS BOOK!", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Trusted advice comes from real, honest experiences and this author has it! He's clearly lived and practiced his principles on creating powerful social networks. How do I know? Because I've seen him in action and in reading this book, he lays out pretty clearly what it takes for anyone, from right where they are, to create the kind of personal and professional relationships that bring your life invaluable benefits. You can't put a price on knowing how to forge connections with high-level people who have great personality and great successes to their name. It's something that improves your life on all levels. The \"hack\" to upgrading your own skills, happiness & well-being is without a doubt social capital. One of the highlights of this book is where Jason talks about \"Defining Your Personal Brand\". It was simple yet deeply clarifying and revealing in realizing how to further develop the strength of my character as I want it to be known. Being totally congruent. The exercise was a must! There's plenty more in the book, and I highly recommend you get it! Keith Ferrazzi's book, Never Eat Alone (one of the best networking books ever written), finally has something worth comparing to. The advice is different but absolutely complementary of the other.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "This books is one of the most practical guides to help build your social capital and enjoy the abundance of new opportunities that others will bring into your life. The principles that the author covers in this book should be taught in primary school. It helped me to become the most valuable version of myself, not only to other people but to myself, too. Because he does not only cover the outer work (e.g. conversational manners), but also the inner work (e.g. your mindset) as the most important relationship I will ever have is the relationship I have with myself. The author goes beyond meeting people. He teachs exactly how to naturally connect with people and make them trust you instantly, no matter how high their social status or economic situation might be. Very inspirational. I couldn't put the book down (figuratively speaking because I read the online version). By following the author guidelines I have taken my relationships to the next level and high-valuable people enjoy my company and want to help me to achieve my goals. Highly recommend getting the book. Looking forward to the followup books!", "id": "3"}
{"review": "While your relationships are the foundation for a meaningful life this book covers so much more, it's about creating immense value for yourself and others that allow you to get the most out of this life time, realize your dreams and at the same time impact other human beings in a very positive and inspiring way. It's is a practical, to-the-point guide without any annoying filler, very rare these days. Jason lays it all out there, pretty much step-by-step, and the only thing required of you is to take action, do the exercises and implement the concepts in your daily life. Unlike nearly all other material on these subjects Jason's advice is coming 100% from real life experience. He is living this life and has the data and practical evidence on what works and not. This is huge and makes all the difference. The rewards for putting in the effort are priceless and transcend and connect areas of your life that might currently be isolated, like your career, love, connections with other people, passions, leadership, relationships, everything. This is a must read for anyone who refuses to settle but wants to fully live, engage and experience everything this life has to offer in an authentic powerful way holding nothing back. Cannot recommend this book enough, it's one of the best investments you'll be making for yourself!", "id": "3"}
{"review": "This book is so deceptively straight forward and has a type of common sense you could think it wouldn't work. I can tell you it will work. When I moved to Vietnam 2 years ago I knew one person and had $500. I used nearly the exact same principles laid out in the book, networking and giving where I could to build up my social connections. Through that work, I was invited to be COO of the equivalent of Ticketmaster in Vietnam, I ran the nation's largest Bar Hopping group and now have direct access to influential professors at UCLA and Stanford. I wrote a review based upon what the knowledge in the book can do for you, rather than about the book directly. I rated it 4 stars because the points about how to interact with people were so quickly covered they may seem like only a small step. They are the key. You can go to all the events you want but if people don't 'like' you it doesn't matter. Chapters 5 and 6 are alone worth the price of the book, as they tell you exactly what to do so people will like you regardless of your past, current success (or lack of) or current social circle size. Specific real-world experiences of his tips in action of doing it right and wrong is the only missing part. To Jason's credit there isn't much more he could have said on what to do. This is the one part that must be learned by doing. He stated it several times. He gives good exercises on what to do if you feel anxious about making a 'mistake'. If you follow even 20% of what he says, you are guaranteed to be 'doing it right'. The book is still undervalued for the price. Buy it.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Roughly a century ago, Dale Carnegie penned 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'. That was an indispensable tome, and informed many generations on social etiquette, tact, success and all the rest of it. If there's one criticism I have of that book, it's a little shallow. Well, now we have Treu's 'Social Wealth' to fill in the missing gaps. What Carnegie didn't see is what Treu focuses on. This book, accordingly, has more depth. It's not only about meeting new friends and expanding your social network, it's also about a comprehensive philosophy and modus operandi on how to meet people easily - with a genuine intent, warmth, humor, and candor. As such, it's not really a self-help book per se. It's more about an over-arching philosophy that insists upon 'doing the outer work', as Treu puts it. He makes it very clear that if you're going to get anything out of this book, you need to put the work in. He thoroughly elucidates how to go about it, all you need is the willingness to follow through and do the work. Never before in human history has humanity been so utterly awkward and distant when it comes to human interaction. This is a timely book that can put you leaps and bounds beyond the competition when it comes to social success in business, relationships, romance, friendships - but it's also about transcending a competitive spirit when it comes right down to the immediacy of a spontaneous, unique human interaction. Great stuff, 5 stars, highly recommended.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "This book is a wonderful distillation of 2 main concepts. First, the entire world is made up of networks of social individuals. Second, that giving or helping is the best way to build and maintain these networks. While, obviously, this may appear an oversimplification of the vast amount of information in this book. My own experiential evidence of how those two concepts work has largely formed my view of social networks and relationships. Yes, it can be challenging to meet people. Yes, it will require effort. To be fair, this is not some grand treatise of human psychology or communication, but a meaningful how to guide to building a better network. There are practical tips, as well has advice on how to re-frame interactions that allow you to enjoy talking to people. Additionally, not only do you have the reasoning behind Social Wealth, you have a basic outline on how to achieve it. I heartily recommend this book, it reads well and clearly stands out. Jason has done an impressive job.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "“How to Build Extraordinary Relationships” is a great title, and very well describe the message in the book, and how much value he put on other people. When reading this book you can feel his love and passion for everyone, that this man has high values, being authentic, transparent and a man with a big heart, wishing the best for everyone, and who loves to serve other people. Do yourself a favor, take a leap of faith, and believe when he says: “a critical life strategy and the new currency for creating an extraordinary life is giving, helping and inspiring others.” Jason Treu describe step-by-step the actions needed in order to take our lives to the next level, and how we simultaneously have to be responsible for our own lives doing the inner work and handle our own psychology. I highly recommend everyone to take the time and dig deep into this book and let it inspire you to live the life of your dreams – the real you!", "id": "3"}

{"review": "Jason sent me his book yesterday and I read it in one day. Yes, the book is that good. I'm an avid reader since my childhood so when I say that a book is good, I mean it. My 5 stars are real 5 stars for the quality of information, the structure and the tone of the book. In summary it's well written, well presented and VERY informative. I can tell you from having looked around that you won't find this kind of information elsewhere. This is information for people who want to go to the next level with their social life and be more enlightened with their relationships. I know him from exchanging with him in a facebook group. You have to know that he helped me tons by his advice and support on this media and he still does. This is to tell you that Jason practices what he teaches and that I would not have made so much progress in the last year without his help. Also, by giving his book for free during 3 days, it's an additional proof that he's a giver. A last word on Jason: I have to say that he's THE inspiration for me in terms of social life and contribution to his environment. He's what I call a positive leader. I never met him in real life however I consider him a friend in the sense that I trust him and I know he has my well-being in mind. For instance, through facebook, he encouraged me and helped me to organize a charity event in my home country, Switzerland. I did it for children in hospitals so they can have clowns to make them laugh. It worked exactly as he told me (it's explained EXACTLY the same way in the book as I did it and as he told me). The only thing is that I was disappointed to have made only $160 for the charity. However, you have to start somewhere, right? This is also what this book is about: accepting where you are (that you don't have the social life of your dream) and build from there. I will tell you the truth: it takes time, commitment and patience. I'm in this process and I think I have enough information now from this book to build an extraordinary social life for the next 5 years. Now I know it helps to have pros and cons to make a decision about this book, so here it is: Pros, buy this book if: - You want to take your social life to the next level - You read tons of self-development books and your social life is not reflecting this progress - You want to see and understand what is possible in terms of social life - Other parts of your life are already extraordinary and this part is lagging behind - You want to understand what \"elite\" successful people like Richard Branson and others are doing to be where they are - You want to know what kind of person you will have to become in order to attract the people and opportunities in your life - You are tired of the way we are functioning in most western society: \"what's in it for me?\", in short: taking and consuming. There are keys for you in there to become a giver and a producer - You want to take every part of your social life to a higher level: professional, friendship, dating, family. - You want a book which will give you practical steps and how to make a plan to achieve what you want Cons - I would have liked to see parts that are aimed towards students rather than only professionals. Going to conferences has a different meaning when you have still years ahead to graduate. I would have liked to know how to approach networks when your professional life is in your future. Remember, it's a process, it will take time. It's like a snowball: the more you do it, the easier it gets and more people you attract. At some point you don't even have to try anymore, just by the way you are, people will smile and come to you. Final advice, to complement this book I highly encourage you to read \"Give and Take\" by Adam Grant, one of the person who inspired Jason a lot and myself as well. If you are reading this, it means you're ready to take your social life to the next level. There is always a next level.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "I have no problem making speeches. That is, if I have several (20 or so) hours to prepare. I am an introvert and a deep thinker. Plus I have some social anxieties, but not as bad as I was growing up. Speaking impromptu is absolutely not my strength. But, after reading this book, I have a greater confidence in doing so. The author has great exercises interspersed throughout the book and gives you plenty of resources to practice. The best thing the author said is to remember that this is just a game. Have fun and don't worry about making mistakes. Don't apologize for what you said and don't be afraid to change your train of thought in the middle of the speech. By being authentic, genuine, and energetic, the audience will admire your impromptu speech. I am looking forward to practicing these exercises in the book.

{"review": "Everything in life always seems to boil down to the same principles. Be authentic, have fun, and don't worry! Be confident! If you want to develop your comfort and skill with extemporaneous speaking - this book is great. The Magic of Impromptu Speaking is a well-researched guide, including advice gleaned from a dating course taken by the author, which outlines suggestions, tips, and exercises to hone your skills of speaking on the spot. The book is well organized and user friendly. The lessons follow a rational order and explanations are clear. Andrii Sedniev's writing approach is similar to that of Michael Jeffreys who consolidated the stories of famous public figures in Success Secrets of the Motivational Superstars: America's Greatest Speakers Reveal Their Secrets It begins with his Rule of the First Thought. \"Basically you have 30 seconds to think and should start talking even if your words aren't relevant,\" Sedniev explained in an interview. Your mind will be working at hyper speed, as we think more quickly than we speak, and begin steering toward more relevant thoughts. As you're speaking, keep in mind that every speech has a structure. The author lays out a couple different speech structures, PEEP is a good one, but the most basic is an introduction, main point and conclusion. If you are able to quiet your inner critic, his intuitive advice will reveal its benefits in all sorts of conversations, in business and even more casual social situations.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Magic of Impromptu Speaking presents aspiring speakers with an excellent system of improving one's own natural speech as well as one's ability to interact with others, present dynamic and intriguing points of view, and command attention and respect by aweing audiences with memorable impromptu speeches, decorated with personal experience, humorous storytelling, and conflict resolution. As a veteran of impromptu speaking, myself, having competed in and won several impromptu-speaking competitions through academic Speech & Debate tournaments and the like, I must say that I found Andrii Sedniev's guide to impromptu speaking both original as well as delightfully thorough. Not only are all of the tips, advice, and step-by-step instructions meticulously described, but each is also paired with a variety of helpful examples and suggestions. This truly works wonders for advice guides and manuals, because without helpful suggestions and examples from actual experts, rules, tips, and advice fail to become anything more than general knowledge, open to imagination, and while that may work for some, I prefer specifics. This guide absolutely delivers. One of the most comforting, as well as compelling, bits of knowledge shared in this book is the fact that the \"best improvisation isn't improvisation.\" Sedniev explains to readers that much of the magic behind impromptu speaking is simple preparedness, including practicing speeches and answers that incorporate a variety of different possibilities ahead of time so as to cover one's bases when dealing with an actual, interactive audience's questions. I also greatly enjoyed the incorporation of the PEEP approach to impromptu speaking, which stands for \"Point, Explanation, Example, and Point.\" While much of the success of many impromptu speakers can be attributed to their incredible storytelling abilities or the recounting of personal experiences, many others, myself included, like to follow a planned guideline of speaking--making a valid point, explaining said point, providing examples, and then reinforcing the point. This structure has proven greatly beneficial in my own impromptu speeches. The greatest bit of advice, in my opinion, though, was that of how to think on your feet. While I can attest to the usefulness of many of the elements exhibited in Sedniev's system, such as positive attitude, energetic demeanor, and preparedness, I absolutely rejoiced over the section about how to think on your feet, particularly the part about stopping your internal dialogue. This has always been a major issue for me, though I have learned to overcome it. Too often when asked a question or made to speak on the spot, the analytical left brain kicks in, numbing your mind with worry, fear, and ultimately, causes you to overthink your answers. Sedniev's system suggests quickly and effectively shutting down the overly analytical left brain by latching onto the first thought and running with it. I found this advice to be the most beneficial to speakers, as fear and nerves can often get in the way. Sedniev's Magic of Impromptu Speaking far from disappoints. But for a few hitches in editing here and there, it is not only wonderfully meticulous, but is also rich with examples and thorough enough to have you on your way to becoming an incredible impromptu speaker.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "I have always been such a shy person. I am able to cope with my shyness in some ways so many people probably don't know I am shy. I am okay with planned, written out speeches.

This is the kind of impromptu type speaking that I have tried to avoid since high school. After several interviews where I felt I showed my nerves I decided to do something about my fear of impromptu speaking and I bought Magic of Impromptu Speaking. Andrii Sedniev has written a how to guide to teach anyone how to speak with little or no prior preparation. This book is well researched and is filled with great practical advice for doing that kind of speaking most professionals have to do at least on a weekly basis.

He could have titled it how to sound a-hell-a lot smarter than you are or how to speak as intelligently and entertainingly as you actually are somewhere deep down inside yourself. LoL. Seriously, this is a short, easy to read, yet comprehensive enough that you may not need to take it to the next level, how-to bulleted book of the highest caliber. I will read it several times and actually work on the exercises because Mr. Sedniev has thoroughly convinced me this is one of the greatest skills in my repertoire that I could easily acquire with a little bit of work and practice, and the payoff will be residual for the rest of my life. Thank you Mr. Sedniev. Oh, by the way, your impromptu writing style, and the practice questions at the end, absolutely all of it, very fabulous.

I purchased the book to refresh myself regarding interview questions, tactics, and the overall process of preparation for an interview. The preparation work that Mr. Fry has you go through are very helpful. Basically, you do a self assessment so when you get asked questions like: \"tell me something interesting about your self,\" or \"what mistakes have you made,\" what kinds of people are your friends,\" or \"tell me your life story,\" you're more prepared for that type of open ended, behavioral type question. Also, he provides good answers and bad answers (green light / red light) model for a wide variety of questions which are helpful. Even though I've interviewed a lot of folks, I've not been interviewed in a long time. This book was a great refresher. For the younger folks and millennials, there's a lot of common sense stuff that you should know, but maybe don't.... no offense, but I'm trying to be candid. I recommend this book to all job hunters - especially less experienced folks.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The main helpful part of this book is the beginning section and his \"job data input sheets\". Fry takes you through a long process of cataloging your career to date. It helped put things in perspective for me, and got me to write down details I was starting to forget about older jobs. It also created a framing method for me to look at my previous jobs in a different way, specifically less as a collection of duties and more in ways that are useful in the job hunting process. I also found that I was developing answers to use in \"story\" interview questions. I will definitely be using this method going forward to track future jobs. Like all X number interview question books, this one has a long list of questions with example answers. What makes it a bit more helpful than most, is before giving the sample answers (both good and bad), the author takes a few sentences to explain the thinking behind the question. This helped me to better envision my own response. The short sample answers were also general enough to be useful to me, rather than some books were the answers are so involved and industry specific that I cannot see how to adapt it to my situation. The book is not well-written literature. The stop lights are rather silly and his attempts at jokes rarely work. Some of what is covered is self-evident to all but the most socially awkward. I found myself skipping over some sections. But the core of the book was very useful in getting me through the process of analyzing my career to gain the material needed for the next step - the resume and job search books (loved the \"Knock 'em Dead\" series).", "id": "3"}
{"review": "As a recruiter I would recommend this book to any candidate who needed advice on how to be interviewed. 101 Great Answers to the Toughest Interview Questions, provides a detailed, step-by-step process that any candidate, experienced or novice, can use to prepare for an interview. Candidates are told to prepare a series of worksheets documenting their experience, and formulate answers to predictable but challenging questions such as \"Tell me about yourself,\" as well as the dreaded \"What would you change about yourself?\" The idea is to prepare the best possible response, not as a way to fake it, but as a way to avoid mistakes when one is on the spot. For each question, the book contains an example of a good response, and pinpoints the many areas that might trip up a job seeker . Unlike many books for job seekers, this one provides solutions for experienced and inexperienced candidates. The evaluation technique goes beyond the vague common sense advice provided by most websites. (Be on time, be positive, use spell-check. tell them your greatest fault is that you work too hard...) The book includes good information on phone screens. Given the large number of resumes that companies receive, phone screens are a routine step in the process. This book gives the experienced candidate a way to prepare for a phone interview where things like eye contact, are not possible. Fry advises candidates to be honest, and to present themselves in the best possible way. What could be better than that?", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The title of this review says it all, but I'll add a few comments regarding specific things that I liked and disliked in the book. My background: I've interviewed for a variety of positions in chemical engineering, hospitals, professional schools, and most recently the pharmaceutical industry. I've also interviewed and evaluated candidates in hospital settings. I purchased this book hoping to gain additional valuable insights to augment my past interview experiences, but I found the vast majority of advice in the book is either common sense to any experienced job seeker or too general to be especially helpful. POSITIVE ASPECTS -The recommendations for the dreaded \"Tell me about yourself\" question are spot on and detailed--easily the most valuable ~7 pages of the entire book. -Tips on analyzing one's strengths and past accomplishments should help new job seekers as they prepare for first-time professional interviews. -Easy read--most readers should be able to finish this over the course of an afternoon or less. NEGATIVE ASPECTS -Example responses--if actually repeated verbatim in an interview--would sound extremely artificial, robotic, and would definitely never land you a job. I understand that these only meant to serve as examples, but placing them in quotes may fool some readers into thinking that this is exactly what interviewers want to hear (to be fair, this is addressed in the book, but it's buried in the fine print). -As mentioned previously, this book contains a lot of common sense that most readers should (hopefully) know: bathe, wear a nice suit, maintain eye contact, be confident, research the company/position, match your strengths and skills to the position, answer the question that they ask you, don't ramble, etc. -Sometimes the book reads a bit too sarcastic and unprofessional. Passages such as \"You Brought Your Cat. How Nice.\" and \"You reek, bro!\" don't really add to the credibility of the author. OVERALL Don't bother purchasing--you can download a free pdf version of an older edition of the same book (4th, 2000) that essentially covers the exact same points.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "If you're going into an interview without reading this book, you're making a huge mistake. I've bought dozens of books on Amazon but I haven't written one single review. Until I read this book. As a recent college grad in this tough economy my search for steady employment has been a haphazard quest at best. This book has been my guiding light. I was lucky enough to have some experienced professionals help me craft a solid resume and critique my cover letters. I landed several interviews for some great entry level positions at good standing companies in the Boston area. However, that's about as far as I ever got. Then I read Ron Fry's 2 books (this one and the accompanying \"101 Smartest Questions to ask on Your Interview) AND GOT A JOB OFFER. This book prepared me to handle what can oftentimes be a very nerve-wracking experience. Ron lays out the kinds of questions you can expect to be asked in an interview and provides examples of GOOD vs. BAD answers. On top of that he explains WHY they are good or bad answers. This is huge as it helps you get inside the head of the person interviewing you; helps you understand their wants and needs so you can fulfill them with whatever skills/knowledge/experiences you bring to the table. You can either go into an interview and hope that you have all the perfect answers OR you can read this book, craft your own personally-tailored answers, practice them OUT LOUD, and nail the interview. The choice is yours.", "id": "3"}

{"review": "Strengths Finder 2.0 is the follow up to Gallup's Now, Discover Your Strengths. The book includes a revamped version of the StrengthsFinder test that shows you not just what your top five strengths are, but also how you rank in the rest of the 34 strengths from Clifton's model. The new book is light on content (very light) but the test is a substantial improvement. Here's how the book is set up: StrengthsFinder: The Next Generation (A short introduction explaining the need for the enhanced edition of the test based upon new thinking and research in strengths psychology) I: Finding Your Strengths (A 30-page overview of strengths psychology and how the Gallup system works) II: Applying Your Strengths (150 pages outlining each of the 34 themes including what people with that strength look like, how to manage them, and ideas for action if you have that strength). The StrengthsFinder (If you haven't taken it before, the code to take the test is provided in a packet inside the book. You actually have to buy the book to take the test) Emotional Intelligence 2.0 is another book I really enjoyed that follows the SF 2.0 format. Obviously, that test measures emotional intelligence (EQ), but Emotional Intelligence 2.0 has a unique format where the test tells you which of the book's 66 strategies will increase your EQ the most.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "There are many different assessment tools available for people who want to learn more about their personality types, attitudes, behavior, and/or leadership styles. These include, for example, tests and inventories that measure individual qualities and abilities and those that relate these competencies to the interaction with other people. Over the years, I have used numerous assessment tools either offered at work or in graduate-level courses. These include, for example, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® (MBTI) and various leadership questionnaires for skills, styles, culture, interaction, and many others. I found all of these assessments interesting and helpful for my development, yet none of them alone would have been sufficient to give me a comprehensive understanding of myself in order to use my abilities most effectively. In other words, I found that the combination of several assessment tools ultimately helped me to understand myself as a person and my behavior towards peers at work, friends, and family members. Strengths Finder 2.0 is an approach by scientists of The Gallup Organization to provide users with a tool to identify their strengths, or more precisely, their talents. Tom Rath explained it as follows: \"We were tired of living in a world that revolved around fixing our weaknesses [and ...] we had discovered that people have several times more potential for growth when they invest energy in developing their strengths instead of correcting their deficiencies.\" When I read this, I thought this is an interesting and powerful way to look at personal characteristics. I was anxious to use this Strengths Finder 2.0. Tom Rath guided me well through the book and the online test, which allowed me to discover my top five talents out of the 34 common talent themes compiled by the Gallup scientists. The combination of the interpretations of these talents and the development of an action plan for the future was excellent. Rath described that TALENT (i.e., a natural way of thinking, feeling, or behaving) times INVESTMENT (i.e., the time spent practicing, skill developing, and knowledge-base building) equals STRENGTH, which he defines as \"the ability to consistently provide near-perfect performance.\" This means that knowing your talents is only the beginning of growth - the rest is up to you (i.e., to use and further develop the areas where a person has the greatest potential to develop strengths). It is important to mention that Rath recognizes that it is helpful to also know the areas of \"lesser talent\" because they can lead to weakness and can become a hazard in a person's career. I agree with his opinion that the key to success is to be aware of both your potential and your limitations. In conclusion, I consider Strengths Finder 2.0 a valuable book in that it can help individuals to discover talents and more effectively use them. There is no doubt that this book helped me in my professional and private life, and I believe it can help others as well. I highly recommend this book to all people who want to learn more about themselves and see how far they can go with this knowledge in their lives.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The book is a quick read and very helpful in getting one to think about one's strengths and the potential complementary strengths to look for in others to offset one's weaker areas, if you work in a team environment. However, once I completed the online test and obtained the resultant reports, I was shocked to learn that I would only get the Top 5 Themes, and the other 29 remain a mystery. Upon contacting the company, I learned that for an additional $550.00 I could then obtain the other 29 themes, as well as their order of ranking. It is obvious to me that this book is being used as a sales \"hook\" to try to get you to spend more money with the company and may also be being used as a \"beachhead\" sales device to penetrate into potential corporate accounts. I was not surprised or enlightened at all by the results, as I have been through a number of these types of profiling and behavioral characteristics tests over the years. However, they were \"somewhat\" useful to reconfirm some of my prior findings as still being current as of today. I would recommend the book and online test if you have never been through something like this before. They are quick and very easy to use. Just be aware that the top 5 themes are only a glimpse of your total \"being\" and the other 29 are just as important to your knowledge about yourself. However, unless you are willing to cough up another $550.00, you may end up disappointed and still a bit \"in-the-dark\" about your overall strengths. Good luck.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "This book gives you a description of about 32 different strengths that people have, and at its core is an access code to an online Myers Briggs type assessment you can take to identify your strengths. The book is merely a reference for the strengths that an online assessment helps you identify, along with strengths that others may have and how you might identify these in people to work better in teams together. The strengths identification is worthwhile, but only if you buy the print version (otherwise you don't get a code and can't take the test!) I originally bought the hardcopy of the book a few years ago and took the test, and then my girlfriend and I were recently reading over my assessment. Wanting her to take the test too, I searched the Gallup website in order to purchase another code. Ridiculously, the only way that it seems that one can take the test is by purchasing another (hardcopy) book to get a new code. Not wanting to uselessly own two of the exact same hardcopy book on my shelf, and before I knew, I paid $14 for the Kindle version just to get a new code. I would be happy to pay $14 just for the StrengthsFinder assessment tool for my girlfriend. As said, it turns out that the Kindle version doesn't contain a new code. I'm basically asking Gallup to take my money in any which way that doesn't include buying and shipping me the same useless hardcopy book again. To be fair I'd recommend the hardcopy book and taking the test once, but not buying the Kindle version, or owning the hardcopy twice. It's been around for years and I've seen many people with complaints about not being able to purchase just a code. That's pretty lame.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "This book was provided by my employer as an HR exercise. Being one who rarely feels motivated to leave reviews, I have two main thoughts about this book: Thought #1: \"What a Brilliant Idea!\" ----------------------------------- As an entrepreneur, I can readily appreciate that this is the first book I've ever come across where the author ensures that: a. You provide them with your email address, name, demographic info (such as age, gender, zip code, birthplace, etc) b. Each and every reader must purchase the book new at an inflated price, because each book contains a unique code that can only be used once for their online test. In other words, you can't share the book with others as the book itself has no value. So don't plan on being able to get this from the library, lending to your family/friends, etc. c. You really should think of the book cost as payment for an online personality test -- the kind that you normally wouldn't bother doing even if it were free. Thought #2: \"What a Total Waste of Money.\" ------------------------------------------ a. Firstly, I found the structure of the quiz itself to be fairly annoying. For instance, each question in the quiz asks you to rate two self-descriptions. However, many of these questions are not dichotomies. For instance, one question may be: \"Which characteristic to you most strongly identify with: (a) Motivating People, or (b) Encouraging People?\" Sorry, I've forgotten the exact questions now...) b. Secondly, the actual results of the test are useless. After taking the online personality test, you are presented with a list of 5 \"Strengths\", each accompanied with a checklist of about 10 fairly obvious action items. For instance, my top strength according to this book is \"Strategic\". The book's top Idea for Action in my case is \"Take the time to fully reflect or muse about a goal that you want to achieve...remember that musing time is essential to strategic thinking.\" Wow, such insight! c. Before you bother buying the book, I fully recommend that you flip through it in a book store to see the kind of advice that you may get for a particular strength that you feel applies to you. If you find the simplistic suggestions to be as obvious as I have, then there is absolutlely no reason to buy the book. After all, there's no point in paying for the personality quiz (and giving the publisher all of your contact and demographic information) if the resulting suggestions have limited value. The central concept of the book is: \"Focus on utilizing your strengths, and don't get caught up on your weaknesses.\" There, now that you read that line, you have no further need to purchase this book. You know what you are good at -- now look for ways to implement those strengths to help you to advance your goals and achieve your personal definition of success. However, from a purely business standpoint, I must say: Kudos to the author and publishing house for trailblazing this new approach of closely linking interactive web content with the physical book. This is guaranteed to be a huge moneymaker for them, and will likely motivate other publishers to figure out how to require the use of one-time use activation codes in their own publications! Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well for shared knowledge and the free-exchange of ideas and resources with friends/family and libraries, but what an innovative business idea!", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Wow. You buy this sort of thing to get uplifted, not descend into cubicle-think hell. To say that I'm disappointed would be a major understatement. The book and test are absolute garbage. The questions are absurdly strange, many couldn't be answered, and the online survey results are contradictory. The results did not match my personality or \"strengths\" at all. I had more accuracy with a free online astrological chart. And the way it \"typed\" people was so \"Business Management 101!\" All was geared toward some ideal of successful assimilation into some cookie-cutter management strategy for a cubicle-filled universe of drones trying to be better \"team players.\" The book seems like it was written by a straight A eight-grader. It was filled with incorrect punctuation ( i.e., consistent overuse and misuse of commas), and was otherwise poorly edited. Come on, people! WORSE than useless! I want my money back, but it's not worth 20 bucks to give this trash another thought other than to write this review with the hope that I can discourage people from buying it and, thus, save them 20 bucks, 2 hours, and some unforeseen depression.

The research link shows a test/retest reliability of .6 to .8 after 8- 12 weeks. The website is usable, but sucks. As an OMI designer, I'm entitled to a professional opinion, complete with technical terminology. ;) Having said all that, The test provided a partial, reasonable estimate of what I already know. For me, at this time and place, it appeared to work well, and provided a basis for interesting discussion. Given the understanding that NO test like this is \"accurate\", and discussion with thoughtful friends, this seems to be a useful tool.

{"review": "There are two parts to this book: one is the book itself and the second is the assessment (which a code that comes with the book gives you access to). The book itself has valuable information in it but the assessment is the primary value of this package. This book benefited me in a few ways: * There is an essay at the beginning of the book providing an overview of the author's views on the importance of understanding and applying your strengths. This helped me understand, in particular, that I needed to be in a job where I could consistently apply my strengths. I also came to understand that the job I was in at the time was a poor match for my skillset and that I needed to move on to something that was better suited for me. The author describes some of the effects of working in a job that was a poor match for you and it was like he was reading my mail. I can't help but think that there are a lot of other people like me out there who could be saved a lot of unhappiness and stress by the ideas in that essay. * It helped me understand what my top 5 areas of strength were. Some of these were not a surprise; some of these were completely new to me but made sense once they were explained to me. For example, my assessment said that I am a strategic thinker (meaning that I am good at coming up with alternatives and identifying patterns and issues). I had never thought of that, but once that was pointed out to me I can see that in myself. * It helped enable me to articulate what my strengths were. This was especially important on job interviews, where I used to dread the infamous \"what are your greatest strengths?\" question. Now I can answer that question with ease in a way that presents my qualifications in the best possible light and I can even relate my strengths to other questions in the interview process. I spent a long time as a contractor working on a lot of short-term projects so I have gone through the interview process repeatedly since I read this book and have gotten quite a few jobs; I attribute my success at least in part to this book. * It helped me understand what distinguishes me from other people. * It helped me understand how to apply my strengths. Regardless of what stage you are in your career, this book can help you be more successful. Not just at work but as a person. I can now see better how I can use my strengths to benefit others and can apply my strengths in personal relationships, organizational leadership, and even my hobbies.", "id": "3"}

Rolling the foot on the ball of the ankle is a form of gravity defying behavior, and will more often than not, signify happiness. And tapping of the foot can mean anything from \"I'm nervous and trying to calm myself down\" to \"I'm bored\" to \"I've got a lot of a stimulant in me\" to \"I'm angry\". Things need to be viewed in context, not \"this means that\". I was only reading this over looking for a good book on the subject for a friend of mine.

Nevertheless, although much of this book is very basic, there are a few gems that make the price of free and the 20 minutes it took to read well worth it. There is a list of power questions that serve as great fodder for elevating a conversation, and thus strengthening the connection available to you. Some of these questions may seem obvious, but it's surprisingly helpful to have them readily available as opposed to having to dig for them in your working memory. For example: > What has been the most life-changing experience you've ever had? > What is the most spontaneous thing you've ever done? > Who's had the biggest influence on your life? > What dream would you most like to make a reality? If a conversation is lagging or you want to take an otherwise decent conversation to the next level - whip these questions out. I highly recommend it. It works.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "It covers a lot of things that are very basic when it comes to communicating, things that you can kind of Google and look up online. Some of the conversation starters are a bit outrageous, it's like who would really ask a question like that to start a conversation? Questions like: Who is the most interesting person you met?; What has been the most life changing experience you ever had?; Who's had the the most influence on your life? I can't imagine you actually asking these questions to a person you just met, you would probably have to paraphrase them if you do try. The only notable advice it gives is to like everyone unless they give you reason not to, that way you can connect to them more. Also, it's okay to NOT have a perfect conversation each time; each experience eventually becomes better than the next. Overall, if you haven't read a book about conversation at all, this would be a okay book to start with. If you are looking for something more advanced, this book doesn't provide new insight - it would just confirm the things you know already. But I think if you are looking for a book to build better rapport with people, a better place to start are books by Nicholas Boothman.

{"review": "The thing I enjoyed most about this book is the fact that you can jump into and out of different sections of the books and get great ideas. Some may be simple reminders, and some may be \"ah-hah\" type ideas. But I much prefer this rather than having to plow through a big book on personal finance. Sometimes we don't necessarily need some big, groundbreaking personal finance \"system\". Sometimes we just need a book that will help us say, \"oh yes... I need to be doing that more, or doing this less\".", "id": "3"}

{"review": "I am a medical doctor who has read many money saving and personal finances looks. Most of them say the same things, buy insurance, save 10% and don't waste of money... all very generic information. Live Rich Save Money! 68 Powerful Ways to Save Money Now and Forever... is different. This book gave me a real education and awareness about financial products, financial decisions, and the importance of research before I do anything. That is very valuable information. The numerous websites including her own liverichsavemoney.com and liverichcalculators.com are very useful, to me, for research. If I have to say I have a favorite part of the book, it would be the Live Rich versus Live Poor concept that I got my nephews to understand. They now understand that you can make a lot of money, but still \" Live Poor. The most useful information I started to use right away is on budgets, retirement, and college costs. I have created a budget to take me into retirement and understand that I need to understand retirement in order to live the way I want to. My niece just started college, I am helping her, since the college loans that she qualified for are private loans... I learned from the book to research everything.. And that is what we found from the research. It would have been financially devastating for her to get those types of loans for college.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "'Live Rich Save Money' is a very useful and well written guide on how to maximise your finances. It is a clear guide with a lot of great suggestions and practical advise. The author explains different ways of saving up money through, for instance, insurance, college, mutual funds. One of the advantages of reading this book is that it covers a wide range of subjects and has very useful advice on all of them. One of the aspects I found very useful is the list of resources to use to maximise our savings. Another aspect I really enjoyed about this book is that the style is very straightforward, the language is easy to understand, you do not need to be an expert in the field to get it. I am sure that thanks to this informative guide everybody will get a lot out of the many tips the author gives. Without doubt, after reading, everybody will be able to draft an effective plan for their financial well being. I would highly recommend it to people of any age interested in effective ways to save money. This is a really complete and helpful guide on how not to waste your money and how to cut your expenses.

{"review": "I love a calendar that I can easily discover what is happening when for every individual in our family. Most calendar will have only one square for a specific day. This particular calendar is flexible to the point the each people have their own column through the month and for a specific day I just have to look at the row to see who has something going on that day. Okay, I will admit that I use various calendars – one in the kitchen for a quick look at it if I am on the phone and the outlook version on my pc and iPad for when I am out of the door as well as to coordinate with my husband. The computer is not always open in my office so it is easier for me to have a IMG_2299quick look on the kitchen calendar in order to see if there are any issues with appointments or activities. I particularly like this calendar because of the bright colors, the funny illustrations and the stickers that are included in it to make the month more interesting. Besides, with this calendar starting at the month of August 2014 and going on until December 2015, you can be sure you will be all set up for the upcoming school year. We already started entering the events going on in our lives in August and September – things like camp, vacation, a birthday party, coop days, Awana nights and much more. I am waiting to learn when the swimming lessons will start in September. Already I have four appointment for my eldest son who will have orthodontics as well as our regular dental appointments and the optometrist for the kids. Without realizing it, the calendar is slowly getting filled for Aug., Sept, and Oct. To be honest, knowing when our coop days for our homeschool will be happening, I have already entered them through the calendar. Same goes with birthdays in our family. That way the kids can flip the pages of the calendar and learn when they will have something happening. They love to check the next month when the current month is almost finished. In our family, mom and dad share a column and each kids – all four of them – have their own column. So it is easy for my 6th year old girl to check the last column and see if something special is happening for her that day. Right now, I feel as though my oldest son has a more active life than us but seeing that he is at youth on Tuesdays and serving at Awana on Thursdays it make sense. If you are looking for a calendar that will give you a quick idea of what is happening for each person in your family, I think that the Mom’s Family Calendar would be a great product for you to look at. I have seen another mom calendar at Costco and I don’t find it as flexible as this one since it doesn’t give you a column per person. I really like the fact that I can do quick glance view in order to see if a specific family member has something special going on.", "id": "20"}
{"review": "I buy this calendar every single year. It comes with stuff I don't want or really need (a mini magnetized white board, and a lot of stickers), but it is the only way I know to keep up with the conflicts that emerge in family life from four different people headed in four different directions all the time. If you're trying to coordinate carpools, make sure a kid isn't left standing on a corner waiting somewhere, and that there are enough cars to go around to match the number of events that need to be arrived at, this is the product for you. There are five columns left to right, one for each person (hopefully) in the family. (Our dog has his own column.) Then the days are listed, from top to bottom. At a quick glance you can identify conflicts (where two kids need to be dropped off in different locations at the same time, or similar). It's a lifesaver. I've bought cheaper versions but they are on flimsy paper and the punch hole at the top wears out before the year is over. I also think they should go back to just making it twelve months, as most people I know who use this buy it reliably every single year.", "id": "20"}
{"review": "The best calendar around for busy families. This is the 4th year I've ordered this calendar! Each person gets their own column, for up to 6 people (or pets). Whatever important dates or appointments or practices are coming up for a person can be entered in their own space. The calendar also comes with fun stickers to use when scheduling. Since we don't have 6 people in our home anymore, I use the extra columns for pets, grandparents, grown children & grandchildren. Plenty of room for anything I need to write. When the calendar is expired I file it, since it an easy to navigate point of reference to look up past appointments or notes. It's a sturdy, joyful, well made, logical, easy-to-read calendar - the best on the market!", "id": "20"}

The left side is the date and day of the week (going down the page) and it has 5 columns to the right that can be labeled by family members so each can have a row or 2 (depending on family size) of boxes to write their own reminders or appointments. There are only 2 of us in our house but boy do I find it handy. Use some of the free spaces for the pets. Only draw back for me is I can't get my husband to stay within the lines. I would highly recommend this for busy households. We draw a large black line downward through the days as they pass.", "id": "20"}

Can keep my work schedule (which changes daily), can keep my husband schedule (which changes daily) and my two kids' activities (I can remember what is for which day, but my husband can't). This calendar helps him figure out what the kids are supposed to do that day! Life saver!", "id": "20"}
{"review": "I just received my calendar and can't wait to start transferring my information for the remainder of this year on to this New calendar. This will be my first year with the Amy Knapp version - already I can see positive differences between this one and my previous MTM calendar which I've used for 5 years running. The writing space is darn close to the size I'm accustomed to - no significant decrease. 2\" x 3 1/4\" with a blue highlighted area on the bottom line for 'dinner menu'. That's a nice change. The stickers are standard: - not as many offerings, but more of what I use, so it's good for me. They include: Happy Birthday (20), family vacation (20) , Meeting (20) , Travel (20), Dentist (10), Doctor (20), Vet(5 cat, 5 dog), Party (10), Important (20 in 4 colors), School Event (10), Half Day (20), No School (30), Practice (30 - sport whistle), Game (20 - flag), Car Repair (5), Repairs (5 - hammer), and Pay(30) stickers with a tiny line for who, a line for the dollar amount and a green dollar graphic The overall layout of the Amy Knapp version is cleaner looking; no cutesy pictures for my kids to color, but they never did that when they were younger, either. There is a section at the top/bottom of the month to list Projects. Also, a prefilled in Monthly Projects list of things like 'talk to your kids about their Halloween costume' - in August! Research and discuss spring vacation plans! In October it lists: things like 'clean out your pantry and cupboards. Donate extra canned goods to a food bank' and \"schedule regular maintenance and cleaning for your fireplace and chimney' January starts with \"focus on the positive - you!' and February asks \"Check in on your resolutions - how are you doing?' and 'Make summer camp plans' and 'confirm spring vacation plans' and 'clean out under your kitchen sink'. Lots of little reminders like this that are timely and not too 'little kid' specific. At the back of the calendar are 2 pages that provide 24 tear off lists for writing your own 'take away' list or something like that. I haven't quite figured out how I will utilize these. The ONLY downside I can see with this version is that is Lacks a Back Pocket on the inside back cover. This almost made me NOT buy the calendar because I use this pocket extensively: It holds the school calendar, tickets for upcoming events, trip confirmations/boarding pass printouts, etc. Anything that I KNOW I have to use. If this calendar had to pocket I would have given it 5 stars. But the pocket is so important I had to down grade it to 4.", "id": "3248857011"}

My 6 year old likes looking at the different holidays on it, and when the birthday parties are during the month. There are 7 blue lines for each day so you can write down multiple activities.

{"review": "This is my first year with Amy Knapp's Big Grid Family Organizer. In the past I have always ordered the More Time Mom's Calendar. Forgive me if this review is picky but I consult my calendar ten times a day, some little things make a real difference. The things I like about this calendar: The blue and green ink colors are nice. The font used to write holiday reminders (i.e. Queen's birthday) is small and thus easily ignored if I do not celebrate that holiday. There are two pages of to do lists at the back of the calendar. Each list is perforated and can easily be removed. Weekend blocks are a little bigger than weekday blocks. The daily blocks are 3 5/16 heigh and 2 inches wide. Weekend blocks are open at the side and thus you have 3 inches of width on Saturdays and Sundays. The paper is good quality and ink does not leak through. Things I do not like: Each square does not need to have \"dinner menu\" written on it. \"Dinner menu\" could be written once at the top of each month and I would understand the blue squares are for my dinner menu. The blue bar takes up 9/16ths of the daily square's height. The top of the calendar has the month, Monthly Projects section with several items for you to do each month, and a Don't Forget section for your handwritten to do list.This space takes up 3 3/8 inches of the calendar's height. The Monthly Projects often do not apply to my family (i.e. \"Sort coupons and discard those that have expired.\") The pages curl a bit at the edges of the midline as you turn them. A plastic coil is a better option. There is no back pocket. The stickers fit at the top of each square but take up more than one line if you are putting them any where but the top line. Other information you might appreciate: There are seven lines on each day. The stickers are 20 happy birthday, 20 family vacation, 20 meeting, 20 doctor, 20 important, 20 half day, 20 game, 30 no school, 30 practice, 30 stickers with a picture of cash and \"pay _____ $_______\", 10 dentist, 10 vet, 10 school event, 5 car repair and 5 repairs with a hammer stickers. Each sticker measures 5/8 inch square. In addition to the Don't Forget spot, there is a Projects and a Family Notes and Reminders area on each month for your handwritten notes. A small previous month and following month are on each page, as well as, a quote, a celebration for that month (i.e. Clean Air Month).", "id": "3248857011"}

{"review": "I'm pretty sure this is the best price for this item available online, at least. As a teacher, I've used this model for my lesson planning for the last 4-5 years. For those of you who use fountain pens, the paper is on the thin side. As an example, Noodler's Ink Heart of Darkness will make pretty dark imprints on the reverse side, making for a somewhat messy presentation. However, the thinness of the paper aside, I have yet to find another solution that works as well as this notebook does from an organizational perspective. If you're an experienced teacher, the space on the weekly side is just enough to keep track of lesson plans and homework assignments as well as bell work and notes for adjustments to make from period to period. The notes section on the right is invaluable, giving you plenty of space to work out ideas, diagram white-board presentations and jot down \"ah-ha!\" moments before they disappear into the ether. As a high school English teacher, it fit the bill for me. My only wish: thicker paper stock so that I could use my inks of choice without having to worry about it bleeding through. In all fairness, the paper quality/thickness of ALL Moleskin products really are inferior to a lot of the other products out there, but in terms of size, organization, and that quintessential \"moleskin\" factor, I have yet to find a worthy successor to this solid product. Of course, you could just go full-digital, but there's something to be said about analog and the thinking that happens when one is forced to write things down.", "id": "3248857011"}
{"review": "I want to like this. I do like the size and the format. The binding is fine. I like the color scheme and the tint of the paper. I even like the included stickers. However, the paper (obviously a key component) is disappointing. It's too thin. Not good for a fountain pen. Even a black roller ball shows through, significantly, on the other side. It is usable with a ballpoint or a pencil (although even these show through more than I would prefer). The paper also seems unusually sensitive to moisture. An inadvertent smudge of water will wrinkle it up to an unusual degree, possibly because it is so thin. I'm concerned about the ability of this planner to hold up for the 18 months that it covers. The paper is just not the quality I expected for the price. It would be ok if it was a journal, if one was content to just use one side of each page. This design, however, requires that one be able to write on both sides of a page. I am using it, with a pencil, but would not purchase it again.", "id": "3248857011"}

{"review": "Jonas lives in a \"perfect\" world where war, disease, and suffering have all been eradicated. Everything is in order; everything is under control. The people have no worries or cares. The Community strives for \"sameness,\" in which everyone and everything are the same and equal. To help the Community function as a cohesive unit, each member is assigned a position in society. When Jonas turns twelve, the Community selects him to be the new \"Receiver of Memories.\" Only the \"Giver\" knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas. The Giver is a wonderful book. Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story. She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this \"perfect world.\" The Community's advisors intend to establish security within utopian society, but they really establish a stifling dystopia. To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life, the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people. In effect, the citizens have no freedom of choice; they do not choose their job or even their spouse. Moreover, the advisors inhibit the people's ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life. For instance, individuals must take a pill everyday, which suppresses passionate feelings. The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love. One of the goals of the Community is to achieve \"sameness\" so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different. However, this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image. Finally, to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past, the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world (also known as \"Elsewhere) and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society: the \"Receiver.\" Therefore, the Community lives only in the present, and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life. They are naive; they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories. While receiving the memories, Jonas learns a different and better way to live and realizes what he and the Community have been missing. He decides that something must be done to change the current conditions and enlighten his community. Although it is a Newbery Award Winner, The Giver is a controversial book that has been challenged and even banned. After parents complained that the violent and sexual passages were inappropriate for children, the Bonita Unified School District in California temporarily banned the novel from classes. The Giver has been challenged in other school districts around the country for its \"mature themes\" of euthanasia, infanticide, and suicide. I do not agree with banning and challenging of this novel. It is a great book, and part of what makes it so great is the incorporation of these controversial issues. They force readers to wrestle with their own thoughts and figure out their stance on the issues. Good literature makes readers think. Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore. The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state. A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time. I love this book, and I encourage everyone to read it.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Jonas, an Eleven when THE GIVER opens, lives in a Community where everything is meticulously ordered: houses look alike, people dress alike, each family unit includes a father and a mother (who can apply for one male and one female child). Children begin their volunteer hours when they are Eights, and the Committee of Elders assigns them their roles in the Community at the Ceremony of Twelves. Because the people have chosen Sameness, nothing in their Community is unexpected, inconvenient, or unusual. They have no hills, no color, no cold, no sunshine. Their feelings are only superficial; their memories encompass only one generation. Pain is relieved instantly by taking a pill. They have abdicated choices. The Receiver of Memory holds the position of highest honor within the Community, serving as the repository for the memories and knowledge of generations. Whenever the Committee of Elders are faced with a new situation, they are able to seek the counsel and advice of the Receiver. They have the benefit of experience without having to bear its pain. Because of his intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and Capacity to See Beyond, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory. The current Receiver, who has held the position for decades, then becomes the Giver. Ms. Lowry paints a vivid picture of this Community. Referring to everyday concepts in a slightly unusual way helps to set that society apart from our own. Babies younger than one year are called \"newchildren,\" for example; children of the same age are \"groupmates\"; the elderly, the unhealthy, or those who have broken the rules three times may be \"released.\" Why might parents or teachers consider THE GIVER inappropriate for their children? I can only speculate on this since I find the book profoundly original and commendable: 1. The setting being a community without freedom. It should be noted, however, that citizens relinquished their freedom years earlier in order to escape the accompanying chaos. They are perfectly satisfied with their arrangement and are not oppressed. 2. The family being depicted as a temporary sociological unit rather than a permanent socio-biological unit. Nevertheless, this family unit provides a very nurturing atmosphere. 3. References to \"Stirrings\" (sexual arousal). These occur only a few times in the book and are only vaguely described. Since Stirrings are forbidden in the Community, young people begin taking a preventative pill upon first experiencing them and continue taking it daily until they enter the House of the Old. 4. The idea of young people bathing the elderly of the opposite gender. This happens only once in the book. It is a gentle, caring, and (given the ages of the participants) asexual experience. 5. The concept of \"release.\" This pervades the book, but its meaning remains uncertain until Chapter 19, when Jonas witnesses a release. I would think that for many readers these concerns would be assuaged by Jonas, the young protagonist who, in the course of his instruction, recognizes the advantages of previous systems and selflessly tries to better his Community. Although there are aspects of this Community that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Lowry is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of the characteristics of the Community that disturb us: Do we attempt to make our lives pain free? Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories? Do we use euphemisms? Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies? Do we have anything resembling the \"House of the Old\"? Do we have a ritual that might be called a \"Ceremony of Loss\"? Do we attempt Climate Control? Do we avoid talking about ways in which we differ from each other? In our own Society, without a designated Receiver of Memory, that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Which memories will we receive? Which will we give?", "id": "4"}
{"review": "In a community that is all the same lives Jonas, who discovers he is very different. Jonas is the main character in the book The Giver, my favorite book. I loved The Giver because the plot was very creative, the theme was magnificent, and the setting was vivid. I think you should read this book for many reasons. The theme of this book is clearly represented: freedom, the right to make your own choices, uniqueness, and individuality are worth dying for. In Jonas's community, a commitee selects one's job, war is unheard of, all people wear the same attire, and all are assigned spouses and families. When Jonas is given the special, wonder-filled occupation of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he finds that there is much more to life. Through his task of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he discovers the meaning of love, pain, frustration, color, and cold. That is when Jonas realizes how much more there really is. Life soon becomes overwhelmingly unbearable in his world of \"sameness.\" He finds life isn't worth living without the qualities (often that we take for granted) he discovered. That is when Jonas goes on a dangerous journey to find a land that is different. The setting in this book made it quite a pleasure. Everything in the community was predictable and pre-planned. The housing units were all the same. There were designated spots for everything. The setting helped develop the plot and theme. The mysterious ending leaves one filled with curiousity and wonder. The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry is guaranteed enjoyment, especially for someone who likes a good theme and plot that ties in with the setting. I loved the boook The Giver, and I truly believe that everybody should read it!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Perhaps because it's so lauded I expected more. It's just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead. There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid? Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things. I would have liked more of a \"fleshing out\" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The Giver is a very suspensful book. It is a great book forall ages. I would reccommend The Giver to be put on a requiredreading list. It will intrigue you from the very first page to thevery last. The author did a great job keeping the reader interested throughout the whole book. The Giver is about a boy named Joanes. He lives in an ideal world. There is no pain, no worries, and no memories. Each person is assigned a certain role and that role is carefully chosen and well thoughtout . Each member in the community has to work in that job until they enter the house of the dead. When Joanes is twelve years old he is assigned the most important role in the community. This role requires power, strength, and courage. This job also requires pain, and emotional feelings Joanes may not be ready for. When Joanes receives his training the world in his eyes is now seen in a different perspective. His world is no longer a perfect world. Joanes now realizes all the things and choices he is misssing out on. This explores human's desire to live life to the fullest whether there are good things like pleasure and happiness or bad memories like war, hate and death. Joanes realizes he is no longer happy and decides to do something very drastic. This decision could deeply impact the society Joanes lives in. After reading this book it made me think in an entirely different way. I realized that even though I do not get to do whatever I want, I still have the freedom to make choices, and ultimately I can choose my own path. It helped me appreciate my world for what it is, and realize that in order to feel true happiness, sometimes it is necessary, as happened with Joanes, to feel pain, sadness, worry, and uncertainty. This book is the first book I have read that touched me to this extent. I hope many other people read this and get to experience what I have experienced.", "id": "4"}

{"review": "Required reading by the students at a Middle School where I teach. I decided to read it in order to better assist the special needs students I work with. I wanted to help them understand and I also wanted to be able to answer their questions. The story starts out like any good plot should, but at some point about two-thirds to three-quarters of the way through, you reach a point where you realize that the author must have stopped writing for a considerable period and when she resumed, she had lost her original train of thought and went off on a completely illogical tangent that leads, ultimately, to a fizzled downer of an ending that seems to have been as others have said, a rush job to make it in time to the publishers. The question that I pose to all students who read it is, \"If you could re-write the ending of this book, how would you end it?\" The responses are remarkably insightful, despite their middle school ages.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Imagine that you are in your late seventies, and - although you had a rich career as an English teacher - you have only a superficial concept of what the Newbery Medal is, probably because most of your teaching experience has involved senior high school students. Your son, himself a teacher of sixth graders, is discussing THE GIVER with you, sharing the enthusiasm of both him and his students for the novel. In order to introduce you to his world of children's literature, he orders a copy for you. Your daughter reinforces his sentiments, going so far as to lay claim that she and her family (all discriminating readers) thoroughly enjoyed the novel. Amazon downloads your Kindle copy. You are intrigued by the countless memories of a lifetime carved in the face of the old bearded man on the cover. You begin to read. Having recently joined an audio book club, you realize instantly that this is a book better appreciated through a visual absorption. Some common words are capitalized, for example, and this distinction would be lost in a narrator's presentation. Also, as language itself is extremely important in the book's community - the children always being corrected if they do not use the most accurate words possible - the typography (ellipses and italics come to mind) is crucial, and a case can be made for the value of visual as opposed to aural. It's a slow start. The unidentified aircraft seems out of place in the December sky, and it quickly loses significance as part of the necessary exposition. As the characters, and environmental, sociological, cultural, and governmental functions are revealed, you wonder when the action begins. Too many bicycles neatly placed in their designated ports, too much repetition, so many meals eaten at precise times with no mention of what is being eaten, endless references to routine and sameness, and always community, community, community. A disturbing sense of ennui skitters across your mind. Why all the accolades for THE GIVER? Continue imagining that you are committed to completing the book for the sake of respecting your children, although it does occur to you that father, children, and grandchildren are not on the same page ... or even in the same book. On and on it trudges. No chapter titles - just a red 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ... Seven, or the end of seven to be more word explicit, is where the action begins. The author suddenly jolts you into the so-called \"rising action.\" Finally it has begun, and - in spite of your age - you are pulled into the world of children's literature and a darned good story about an age of dystopia. You run a literary marathon and finish the rest of the book without stopping. Your son said it would be like this, and it's nice that you continue to respect his intelligence, but you're not too certain of the reliability of your own. You really didn't give Lois Lowry or her book or her talent a chance. To be fair, you should have reread the first few chapters before continuing. But something's not right. You liked the book, and were caught up in the terrible truths of the community, and were right there with Jonas and little Gabe through the final chapters. Yet a certain satisfaction is missing. You almost feel like saying, \"So? It was good, but I've read better books.\" Imagine then the memory of a bruised ego. You're a retired teacher, for crying out loud ... sort of a Giver yourself. To save what you can of self-respect and stave off complete humiliation (your son said, \"Can't wait to talk about it!\"), you do a computer search, checking out Wikipedia and a few good book review sites. And you make sure that your paucity of the Newbery Award is rectified. You even reread the opening chapters, which, of course, at this point changes your entire perception of the novel. THE GIVER deserves the Newbery, and probably more, if for no other reason than the claim that its underlying theme - the giving and receiving of love- is the key to finding true happiness in this life. Even though the book burners have managed to establish this book as inappropriate for young readers (according to the American Library Association's list of the most \"challenged\" books of the 1990s), THE GIVER continues to remain on countless other lists - those of middle school suggested reading titles. The book is taught even in higher level grades. Maybe it's good to stay in your own community and be happy in your own ignorance... sometimes. But just imagine if ...", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This book,as distrubing as it was, was an excellent sci-fi book that, though odd, makes us all see that there is not, on the Earth we know, a place where everything is perfect as we can not know true happines or pleasure without first expiriancing pain and suffering. Jonas makes me think more, though this is a reach, more about the freedom of choice, for in the Community, there is none. The book striked as a powerful reminder that there is not a better world than that the one we live in, for there would be no happieness if it were the same as the Community, and no feelings. Without feelings, we are not human, and the people in this book scared me that some day there really may be a place that comes around here or in some other life where there are no feelings, color, or, most importantly, love. I also recommend, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and The Price of Immortality", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I have owned The Giver, a book by, Lois Lowry, since I won it in 8th grade (I'm in 11th now). People always tokd me it was good, but for some reason I never actaully read it until this year. I'm glad I did read it because it's fascinating. It was written for young adult readers (my sister read it in her 8th grade class), but I suggest it for people of all ages because it is entertaining and thought provoking. The book is set in a community where everyone goes through the same routines, and feels no emotions. The main character is a young, teenage boy. The boy is chosen to be the next Giver (you'll have to read the book to find out what that means) which is when the reader becomes more aware of the restrictive communtity that the boy lives in. The book has a fast paced plot, but is not a thriller. It isn't a mystery either, but the reader is given information bit by bit until they realize the dull, restrictive the boy used to lead. I think the book has an underlying commentary about the importance of history in a societym and the dangers of extreme comformity. It's an interesting, quick read for adults, and fast paced and entertaining enough for younger children. I think anyone who hasn't read this yet should definitely give it a try.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I've read a few books in my time and very few author's have the ability to keep me so captivated that I can't put it down. In fact other then Nicholas Sparks, Annalisa Grant is the only other author able to do so for me. The Lake is a powerful story of life, love and truth. Mrs. Grant has a fresh style with clear discriptions that you can really feel and see the action as it is being told... which will keep you wanting more! I can't wait for her second book to be released. Layla is so real, that I too think of her; wondering how she is right now as if she's living right down the street.

{"review": "Ugh...I have no idea how I made it to the end of The Lake. Well that is not true, I used it to read at night when I couldn't sleep. Something I knew I wouldn't get drawn into. This book was so long and drawn out and skipped over like everything that happened. So it starts with Layla moving in with her aunt and uncle after her grandfather dies. They are the last relatives she has and she wants everything to work out. She doesn't really know them, but they seem nice and caring. Of course at the first event she goes to in town she sees Will and they are instantly attracted to each other. They quickly fall in love, but they have to hide that because his father is evil and will do anything to stop them from being together. The plot seemed like it would be good, but man it dragged on and on and on. Layla blames herself for her parents death, she caused the accident. It is obvious it was going to be something stupid and she didn't really do anything, but you have to wait for most of the book until you get to what that was. She goes on and on and on and on and on about her life and things that have happened. She goes on about how when her parents died it was horrible, her grandmother was horrible to her, her grandfather was nice but needed a caretaker (her), how she is so happy to be with her aunt and uncle now. How her time with her grandparents was penance for killing her parents. Which fine, I understand all of that, but I don't need it repeated again and again and again. That is one main issue I have with the book, Everything gets repeated again and again and again so much so that by halfway through I was just like enough! I get it! I understand!! You don't have to keep having the same thoughts/conversations for me to remember what she is thinking/feeling! I GET IT! Please stop repeating everything. This book could have been significantly shorter had it not just repeated everything over and over again. It was too much. It just went on and on. Another issue? The characters were very one dimensional. I didn't really care about any of them. I really didn't like Will. He seemed like kind of a jerk, but somehow everyone liked him and he was so magically amazing. I don't get it. I didn't see it, but everyone keeps saying it. That is what happened with all of the characters. You would hear again and again and again how someone is x, but they wouldn't really show you they were. The dad who is evil? Well....for most of the book I didn't see it. So he helps beat up someone and Layla sees, but even after that she is again and again and again told that he will do anything to keep her away from Will and she is just like well he won't really do anything bad...then he doesn't really. He is the boogie man, but never really seems to do much. I was very disappointed in his terror he unleashed on the family. I expected more, especially after being hit over the head time and time again with how horrible and evil this guy was. Then Layla and Will in love? I didn't see that either. We just were told again and again that they are. They can't be without each other. I didn't see why they liked each other. One other thing with this book. Layla is moved into this world where people are super rich, but we never get to see that world. We don't really get to see many of the day to day things she has to get used to. She goes to this super fancy school, but we never see her interact with her classmates or see how she tries to fit in. We just get her going on and on about Will and her past life and how she loves Will, but his father is horrible. So much repeating of the same thing, when the story really could have used more story. More something to show the characters and what they were really like, instead of just telling us. It was a wasted opportunity. There is not much I liked about this book. Really I am trying to think of anything I did...it just was not very good. I am not sure why there are so many amazing reviews for it. It was boring and repetitive and slow and I just didn't care about any of it. I didn't realize this was part of a series, but I will not be reading the next book (even though this book does end in kind of a cliffhanger. You don't find out what happened, but I don't care enough to try and read another long drawn out story). This review was originally posted to [...]", "id": "28"}

And the 'parents' show how you can have an open and meaningful relationship with your teen. All the while having a great plot and twists and turns in between.

{"review": "I first heard about this book at an SCWBWI conference where its editor from Delacorte spoke highly of how it grabbed her attention right away. I have to agree. The one thing that Dashner does right from start to finish is barely provide enough information to answer the questions that form in the reader's mind BUT what information he gives does promote one to keep reading. Curiosity drove me to read this book straight through...that and the fact that the writing wasn't all that challenging. I'm not trying to bag on Dashner, but I was a little surprised at the many passed-on opportunities he had to draw me further into the story or even care more about the characters' fates . I felt consistently disappointed with what I was offered of Thomas's character -- far too sulky and desirous of screaming at people who can hardly offer him the answers, etc. he's so desperate for. And Teresa, for as important as she's made out to be, is so flat. I think it was well within the author's scope to improve the depth of these characters considering the decent job he did on secondary characters like Chuck and Minho. By the time I reached the end, I all but rolled my eyes. I felt roughly the same as I did when I finished watching 'The Cube'...interesting story, but what was the point of putting the characters through all that? Especially when the characters themselves hardly spend any real time trying to understand their situation. And this latter part actually seems quite critical to the purpose of the situation they're in. Okay, I know this is meant to be YA but it certainly had room to grow in the 'thought provoking' department. It's a decent and entertaining story, but will it become the topic of critical academic discussion? Not likely. It's far too light in depth and development as it stands. Perhaps the eventual trilogy as a whole will provide something 'more'.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "After completing the Hunger Games trilogy, I was eager for another great YA dystopian read but did not find it in The Maze Runner. I was initially intrigued by the book's description. I knew there would be boys caught in a maze, with their memories wiped and little hope for escape, and I knew that the appearance of a girl on the scene would change everything. Mazes, games, riddles, and other sorts of non-traditional mysteries attract me, but Dashner's execution of his book did not. The plot was ill-paced. At times it felt slow, because Dashner introduced the reader to the maze in the same way the main character, Thomas, was introduced to it: both the reader and Thomas learn almost everything through numerous secondary explanations by characters. In more skilled hands, this might be an effective way of immersing a reader in a fictional world. Dashner's exposition, however, felt cumbersome. As a reader, if I'm going to be told about a world rather than shown it, I'd better be told well. When I wasn't slogging through Dashner's writing, I was tumbling head-over-heels down its textual cliffs. Parts of the novel simply moved too quickly for any real character or plot development to occur. Readers are barely introduced to the main protagonist before being introduced to Teresa, the girl who supposedly changes everything. We really have very little sense for what's changing, because this inciting action comes so shortly after our encounter with Thomas. The plot also felt as if it had been constructed with little forethought. Each step or twist in the plot seemed as if it were generated on the spot as the author wrote his way linearly through this novel. Shazam! Such and such happens out of the blue. A quick patch-up of missing explanation ensues. Shazam! The next twist happens, followed by some explanation. And so on, until one of the biggest Shazams!: The crew exits the maze and suddenly, for no apparent reason, one of their members is killed. Subtle build-up of suspense and intricately interwoven plots do not exist in this novel. It's almost entirely composed of sudden action followed by explanatory reaction. All this might not matter so much, if I'd felt in any way connected to the characters. But I didn't. Most of the boys meshed together in my brain, particularly since so many of them end up acting \"out of character\" anyway. As for Teresa and Thomas, readers know little about their back-story (until the peritextual \"Exclusive Wicked Correspondence\" at the end), and I didn't find their characters all that complex, deep, relatable, or quirky (aside from their obvious telepathic skill). Character \"complexity\" in this novel was little more than character \"unpredictability.\" In short, I was disappointed. The reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1, though, is because I did at least finish it. I've no intention of reading the sequel, however.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "A hundred or so teenage boys, their memories wiped, are trapped in the center of a gigantic shifting maze, many miles across. As the book begins, Thomas arrives in the \"Glade\" -- the center of the maze, where they all live. The next day the first girl ever shows up too. And everything begins to change. While living in the center of a giant ever-changing maze full of monsters is an extremely odd way to live, the boys have made do. After two years, they have a ruling council, they grow food, raise animals, and look after any sick or injured. They also send out trained runners to map the maze every day, in search of an exit, or a pattern, or some clue as to what they're doing here. With the arrival of Thomas and the girl, the Gladers' carefully-crafted order begins to break down. Now solving and escaping the maze is immediately necessary. Fortunately, Thomas isn't quite like all the other Gladers, and is able to help. The premise is great, and the plot moves well. There's a lot of action and the tension constantly builds. Unfortunately, the story failed in two important aspects for me. First, the the maze itself is so absurd, the final explanation had better be pretty impressive for the story to hang together. And at least for me, the explanation was not plausible. Though, at least there *is* an explanation, which is more than can be said for some stories I've encountered! The second weakness was the characters. I'd be okay with a somewhat implausible scenario if the characters were likable enough. But, Thomas is bland and whiny, and his only moments of greatness arise from his forgotten past. The other boys are mostly hostile and uninteresting. Not, mind you, that I expect deep, sophisticated personalities from amnesiac teenage boys! They were all believable, but they weren't compelling enough to carry the story. Neither was the new girl very interesting. Thomas is attracted to her, but again, that's an artifact of his past, not a real live reaction that we get to watch develop. Overall, it was a fun read, and I don't regret the time spent, but I won't look for the sequels.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The Maze Runner kept me up to the wee hours of the morning as I raced to the finish. I loved it in every way: the pacing, the characters, the plot. Thomas wakes up to find himself in a box that opens up to the glade, the central part of an elaborate maze where monsters dwell. From the moment of Thomas's entrance into the glade, he works to try and recover any part of his memory while also trying to solve the maze and stop the deaths of the boys who live in the Maze with him. I would say this book is a cross between Ender's Game and Lord of the Flies. It's a tale that is expertly woven, true to the target audience of teen boys, and filled with enough action to keep me up all night. The only downfall of the book was realizing I have to wait for the sequel. I look forward to reading more of Dashner's work.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I know there are a lot of positive reviews for this book -- so maybe I'm the one up in the night -- but this book was, by and large, VERY poorly written. Reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner is actually a somewhat strange experience. What I mean by that is usually when an author can't write well, the book -- as a product of that writing -- is simply bad. Period. But in this case, Dashner's story is actually a bit intriguing (though it's the same story device -- \"Who am I?\" -- found in countless videos games), and his plotting is serviceable (though he uses some weasel techniques in the plotting, especially at first, like having characters deliberately withhold information from the protagonist for no story-driven reason). So in spite of how poorly this book is written, I stuck it out to the end (only to find it's the first book in a series <sigh> -- alas, I won't be able to force myself through a second book). One of the main problems (but by no means the only problem) is that Dashner is constantly \"telling\" instead of \"showing,\" which is a violation of one of the first rules of good writing. Indeed, even when he \"shows\" something, he usually feels compelled to \"tell\" the reader too (often at the very same time). The characters are inconsistent. In fact they are almost schizophrenic at times (though it's not character development, just poor writing). They don't feel remotely like \"real\" people. Even in a fantasy -- perhaps ESPECIALLY in a fantasy -- the principle of verisimilitude is an absolute must. Unfortunately, there is a severe lack of the application of that principle in this book. Along those lines, the \"voice\" of the protagonist is downright awful. It's not so much stream-of-consciousness (which at least is a real technique, if an unpleasant one) but the fact that the character's thoughts are simply a jumble (though this is also mostly not character development). His emotions bounce around in odd ways. And he repeats himself, well, repeatedly. Perhaps the problems with this book can be summed by saying the writing itself constantly gets in the way of the storytelling, which is never a good thing. The \"idea\" of The Maze Runner is okay, but unlike -- say -- an Isaac Asimov, who was an \"idea\" writer, and whose characters are -- by and large -- cardboard, this whole mangled mess of writing makes the characters just feel like they are the product of someone who doesn't yet know how to write very well. Almost like a bright high school kid (though Dashner is not) who has yet to come up against a skilled teacher/editor (and thus get schooled in proper technique). Which brings up another point. In his acknowledgments Dashner mentions how one particular editor really helped him and should have co-credit on the cover of the book. Well, I don't know what exactly she did to help (or how bad the manuscript was to begin with), but I kept thinking the whole time I was reading (before I even read the acknowledgments) that what this book really needed was a strong editor to basically teach Dashner how to write competently. This is a book from a New York publisher (and Dashner is a best-selling author of the 13th Reality Series, which I have not read). Has the skill level of those working in the publishing business truly fallen so far? A strong editor could have done a lot with this book and with this writer. It's not that Dashner doesn't have potential. But in the end, reading The Maze Runner was a painful experience and a waste of time.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is a full analysis of the book, full spoilers included. You have been warned. [ALSO, if you choose to downvote my review saying it wasn't helpful, please tell me why in the comments. I welcome everyone's thoughts and opinions, but if you downvote a review of this size without commenting I will be under the assumption you simply downvote all negative reviews.] The story itself was interesting enough for the most part, but the pace was painfully slow and Dashner committed a few things you are not supposed to do in fictional writing, ever. I'm talking newbie mistakes here. The second largest thing that Dashner violated was the Show, Don't Tell rule. He almost assuredly does not understand this, as a lot of his descriptions are flatly told instead of explained. \"Thomas felt sad.\" \"Thomas snapped.\" Dashner does not do a good job showing us his world or his characters, instead just telling us how things are. This interweaves with my next points a bit and is explained in greater detail later. For my second point, marking the biggest mistake Dashner did with this story, he began the book with the White Room Syndrome. Much like the Show, Don't Tell rule, this is one thing that almost all writers know very deeply - do not start your story off with the white room syndrome. The white room syndrome is where your character suddenly wakes up in a completely unfamiliar setting and knows nothing about anything - his past, his name, people he knew, etc... This is cheap because it allows you to dodge any sort of actual development in the world, its characters or the relationships that the characters have. This book in particular suffered a lot because Dashner decided to go this way. One particular area it suffered deeply was with character development. Partially since he had no past to develop from, Thomas was a weak protagonist with nearly no original or interesting characteristics. He seems brave at times, but everybody in this book is. He seems smart at times, but so is everybody else. To me, he is almost a blank slate designed to move the story forward. I cannot list one original characteristic about him - other characters say he is interesting, but that is not the conclusion I came to - if the story didn't follow him, he would blend in with the rest of the characters. The other characters were also an issue. Other than Minho and Chuck, I had a hard time picturing any of them or even telling them apart. Alby was the typical reckless group leader. Newt was the typical nicer more rational second-in-command. Teresa was a typical plain-Jane female side character designed to make the plot actually go somewhere. Minho was interesting, but Dashner could have developed him further than he did. And Chuck was a potentially interesting character, but Dashner killed him off for no reason. It would have been very difficult to develop any of these characters to a great extent, though, since none of them have histories or memories outside of the maze. Because they all have heavy amnesia, they don't even remember who they are - thus, they cannot be deeply developed. They are just a bunch of people trying to get out. I have to wonder if Dashner himself had fleshed his characters out any deeper than this by this point of the story. Another way the whole `no past' thing effects the plot is the relationship between Teresa and Tom. It was possibly one of the weakest romances I have ever read in a novel. They loved each other because they did `before it happened', not because they have actual chemistry. There was no development or movement in their relationship whatsoever - it just started off that they were in love just because they were, and that's where the book left off as well. They loved each other because it's what Dashner wanted for the story, not because it made sense for the characters. Let's put this in contrast to the last book series I read - Divergent. In the first Divergent book, it takes almost 250 pages to fully develop the relationship between Tris and Tobias. Tobias starts off as her superior, and slowly their relationship develops and morphs into something tangible, which is why you were truly able to feel it in that series. It logically progressed into a relationship where you could really believe they had feelings for each other. In Maze Runner, the only reason I felt they loved each other was because I was told to think that. I had no real reason to assume they had feelings for each other besides that, since there was no chemistry, development, getting to know each other or even any conversations that didn't have directly to do with the plot. It was utterly emotionless and monotone and had no effect on me whatsoever - that is not how romance is supposed to be! That's not even how a mundane friendship is supposed to be! What he had with Chuck had more feeling than what he had with Teresa. --- Then there were several gaping plot holes. One that I was particularly annoyed with was how long it took them to figure out that the Griever Hole was the only way out. I mean, seriously... I figured that out the second they introduced it and tossed the rock in. I twas utterly predictable. Just think. They have been running around this big maze for two years and have not found any exit of any sort, but in this one spot there appears to be a hole you can toss thing into to make them disappear. It took them an extra 200 pages to figure out that that was, just maybe, an exit of sorts. Then, it surprised me to notice that Minho has noticed all of those WORLD IN CATASTROPHE: KILLZONE EXPERIMENT DEPARTMENT things all over the walls and never came to the conclusion that this was, oh, I don't know, some sort of experiment or something. It didn't even occur to the characters until the end of the book when Thomas brought it up that this might, just maybe be some sort of experiment. Minho was a pretty intelligent character, and so was Newt and Alby. In fact, it was a main plot point at the end that they are all technically very intelligent people. If this is the case, how did they not figure all of this stuff out a very long time ago? (Getting back to the Telling issue, the only reason I had to believe they were smart was because I was told so. I was never shown them being particularly smart, especially considering the things I mentioned above.) Then there is the scene where the sky disappears. I have several issues with this scene. First, why was the first conclusion Thomas came to that the sky was artificial? I was figuring that something covered up the sky at first, but the very first thing he figured was that it absolutely must be that the sky is fake, with no chance of another option whatsoever. There was no guesswork or figuring out to be done here - he just knew, just because he knew. And at that, where did this even come from? To me, it seems like Dashner literally came up with that on the spot. There was absolutely nothing in this book beforehand to hint that the sky was fake - nothing. If Thomas had thought to himself that this or that looks or seem fabricated or a bit off, it would have made some sense why he came to the conclusion he did so ridiculously quickly when the sky disappeared. But there was nothing. It just happened. Something like this should have been foreshadowed. This is something I feel he does a lot - or, forgets to do a lot. He does not develop a lot of things beforehand that eventually become important, nor does he give clarification afterwards. For an example, the telepathic talking that Teresa and Tom have. To me, this was clearly used so Teresa could move the story forward no matter where Tom was at the time being, but I would have been okay with that if there was another relevant and in-story reason why she could talk to him like that. Sure, he might answer that in the next book, but he should have answers that in this book, since it was a vital part of this story. As far as I am concerned, since he gave no good reason why that is the way it is, I am convinced the only reason why it is there is for a cheap and easy way to move the plot forward. If there is another relevant in-story reason why it exists, he probably could have come up with it in the second book. That all might not be true, but if he either developed it beforehand or clarified it afterwards, there would be no confusion. By the end of this story, I am convinced it existed for no other reason than to easily move the story forward when it needed to, just like the sky suddenly disappearing. It felt like a random event he came up with on the spot so he could get un-stuck in his story. --- Then, at the end, there is almost no resolution to the story whatsoever. They meet a woman who explains to them that this all happened for some sort of good reason (which I logically assumed), but then proceeded to say that that was certainly enough for them to understand and they should just accept it. She could have elaborated on just a bit more to explain a little bit of the context this story takes place in, but does not in any way mostly because she didn't feel they would want to know, or something. It seems to confuse her why making 40 people go through a maze for 2 years for less than 20 of them to survive with no context whatsoever might confused them or make then want answers of some sort. Then a bunch of people come in and kill her, take the main characters to a safe place (while of course explaining nothing about anything, because there's no time to explain) and the book ends. Well, sort of, anyway. The bus driver rushing them to safety explains something about sun flares and a sickness that has ravaged the world and how the maze was all some sort of mental test, but it all seemed non sequitur to the rest of the story. This, again, reflects back to the issue he has with foreshadowing. There was absolutely nothing in this book to hint towards any of this, and it all comes across as being random and on-the-spot. I was unable to correlate anything that happened throughout the book to anything relevant to the sun flares. There were very few answers to anything. Why could Tom and Teresa talk telepathically? What were the Grievers and why were they there? What was the test supposed to do, anyway? How was anything of the story relevant to the last few chapters at all? Those are the sort of things I should not have had to wait for book 2 to have answered, since they were all relevant to this story. Sure, you need to leave some questions for the next book, but the way that he answered absolutely none of them leaves me to assume he might not have had it all figured out by this point. One could argue that Dashner was clever not to reveal anything, but that is just not the case since he did that at the expense of this story not having an actual conclusion. Because of this laziness to answer anything at all, I simply have no desire to find out what happens next. I don't care what he comes up with, since he has not shown me that even he knew where he was going with the story by that point. I'm finding it hard to believe he actually had a big grand plan to reveal to us by this point. Take into consideration how the first Hunger Games ends. (Hunger Games 1 spoilers for those who have not read the book or seen the movie by this point. Skip this paragraph if so.) Katniss and Peeta make the government angry by making a joke out of them at the end of the Games, so at the end of book 1, we have to wait and see how they will politically fight against the government and how they can pretend to be in love when they're not. There was something truly tangible to look forward to in the sequel, and that is what drove me to pick up the next book. This was all done while making the first book a complete story with some resolution. That is how a book 1 is supposed to be done. Now let's go back to the ending of Maze Runner. They escape the maze to learn that it existed for some sort of reason, and the book ends with the promise that you will learn what that reason was later. There is no resolution to any questions raised in the story, there is no other major hook to make you read the next book - there is just no real reason to continue. The one and only hook that the end of this book had was that you will learn what the first book was about in the second book. That's it. Instead of building up new scenarios and conflicts to transfer over, his only hook is that he withheld vital information that should have been at the end of this book that he will give in the second one. In comparison to the Hunger Games, it's quite pathetic and lazy. I am not entirely certain how people can compare this book to the Hunger Games or Divergent. It's just not on the same level of storytelling in any area. The writing is full of telling, the story is riddled with plot holes and plot devices, the character development is lacking, the romance and relationships are boring and there is no real conclusion to the story. I am not certain why people put this book up there with some of the other major titles right now.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Lately, I've been really into the YA dystopian books. I blindly picked up The Hunger Games last summer and loved it. I've since read Forest of Hands and Teeth, Birthmarked, Adoration of Jenna Fox, The Host, and a few others, all of which I enjoyed. I like stories that are not noticeably YA, except maybe for the absence of vulgarities and sex. It was very obvious to me that The Maze Runner was a YA book, which for some, may not matter. But for me, it lacked the depth and intricacies that make or breaks a story. I was absolutely excited for The Maze Runner after reading the Amazon reviews, but this is the very first time I've been so sorely disappointed when picking up a book due to other reviewers' enthusiasm. I had a hard time getting through The Maze Runner. There were a few times it interested me to keep reading, but for the most part I could only read it for a 1/2 hour at a time, when usually I could read for hours on end. Towards the middle I started skimming and reading dialogue to push myself through the bland writing. I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters, and had a really tough time picturing a lot of it, especially the grievers, which I blame on the writing. The new words to substitute for swears were annoying, and the characters very flat. I thought the ending was predictable and lackluster. This book might really work for some but I really, really didn't like it at all.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I just finished all 3 audiobooks. All I can say is that I want to punch Dashner in his SHUCK, SHANK, CLUNK face! (words the characters use NON STOP in all 3 books) There was so much potential in the concept of the book. But it seems like all Dashner did was think up a title for the book, then just started writing it. No planning whatsoever. I kept waiting for more character development, it didn't come. More plot development, it didn't come. There is nothing but one bad situation after another, followed by bad decisions, pointless running around....and then more bad situations. To the point where it's just predictable. Lots of other reviews compare Maze Runner to Hunger Games. My advice; if you haven't read Hunger Games, read it instead of this. If you have read Hunger Games.....Read it again instead of this.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The book is very poorly written - plain and simple. One of the worst I've ever read. Dashner seems to operate on the assumption that the liberal use adjectives and simile tantamount to good writing. Some choice phrasing from the first 10 pages: \"Strangely enough, he felt his fear whisked away like a swarm of gnats in the wind...\" \"He groaned in frustration; his echo amplified through the air, like the haunted moan of death.\" \"The haunted moan of death\"? We all know what that's like. The book alternates between this kind of flowery word choice and unimaginative teenaged colloquial speak. Take for instance, this dramatic exchange: \"Don't get all humbly bumbly on us-what you did was freaking unbelievable...\" Thomas tossed the empty salad plate on the ground, suddenly angry. \"Then why do I feel so crappy, Chuck? You wanna answer me that?\" Crappy! The depth of the protagonist's feeling is clear. Beyond that, the narrator puts little effort in to plotting or character development. Characters engage in an unsubtle withholding of information in what seems to be an attempt to keep the book from ending too quickly. This is best demonstrated in the first half of the book, which is spent with Thomas expressing his seemingly burning (and whiney) desire to ask questions only to be met with a dismissive \"Shut up Greenie. You'll learn eventually\" from the Gladers. The appearance of Teresa seems completely unnecessary, as her character adds no dimension to the story, nor is there any exploration of the fact that she's the only girl. There are also some plot holes that I feel compelled to mention. *SPOILER WARNING* - Do you need to be stung by a Griever in order to take the grief serum and go through the changing? Why did no one think of trying that? - Why did no one attempt to kill the grievers with weapons? - What does being telepathic have to do with designing a maze? - Why does Gally show up at the end, and why is he equipped with a knife he can use to kill Thomas? The death that ensues seems to occur for no other reason than to create a somber tone. The truly interesting thing about \"The Maze Runner\" is that the premise is actually really engaging, which was my reason for finishing the book. Despite the amateur plotting, I was genuinely curious as to what was going to happen, and what was behind the maze. In the hands of an adept writer, this could have been a truly fascinating read. Sadly, Dashner's subpar abilities ruin whatever promise it might have had.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This book would have been great IF: 1) the characters had some personality 2) the main character - Thomas - weren't such a Gary Stu and showed some character development and growth instead of conveniently \"remembering\" important information to advance the plot 3) the book weren't filled with atrocious made-up slang - \"shuck-face,\" really, is this supposed to be cool? 4) the villains - Grievers - were actually scary or dangerous 5) the maze had some kind of mystery about it and not limited to moving walls and un-threatening prickly Grievers 6) the plot weren't based on constant withholding of information by everyone and releasing it 200 pages later than it should have been 7) the smartest of the smartest kids actually did something smart and uncovered some mysteries of the maze during the 2 years spent there 8) the death of main characters evoked any feeling in readers 9) the book weren't so slow-moving (thanks to constant withholding of info) and BORING! In the present form \"The Maze Runner\" deserves nothing more than an OK rating for moderately interesting premise. The hype and comparisons to \"The Hunger Games\" are unwarranted.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "It's time for little minnow to go to bed. Mama minnow always reads him a story, usually about mermaids. This night is no different but there is one little exception to the story. Little minnow is not interested, so Mama minnow continues to encourage him to listen all the way through this very strange story. The story she tells is of a little mermaid who is very unique. This little mermaid named Finnoor was very special, but she didn't think so. She couldn't sing beautiful songs like the other mermaids and her tail didn't have shiny beautiful scales. Her furry tale was tangled and puffy and she tried everything to tame her fur, but no matter what she did it hadn't cured the problem. It made her feel miserable that the other mermaids made fun of her. But one day, the sea became very cold from an iceberg and froze all the other mermaids in an ice cube. The fur on Finnoor's tale kept her warm and free from the ice. If that wasn't bad enough sharks came lurking and bullied the other sea creatures. Finnoor become anger and her tale grew and grew. She wove a net with her long fur and took the sharks away. She then wrapped her fur around the frozen mermaids and gave them the biggest warmest hug she could and they were thawed. At the end of the story little minnow asked if the mermaids thanked Finnoor, but before his Mama could answer he had dozed to sleep. This cute mermaid tale is a great bedtime story that can be shared on any ebook reader. Readers will learn tolerance and to love and except who they are and to embrace their differences. Bright colorful illustrations make for a fun read that young readers will enjoy.", "id": "4"}

{"review": "Lois Lowry has written a number of excellent books including \"Number the Stars\" and my personal favorite, \"The Giver.\" In fact, \"The Giver\" is a book that I would consider truly great. Reminiscent of Orwell's \"1984\", it, too, describes an anti-utopian future of considerable power. But, whereas in \"1984\" we know the strangeness of the world we are reading about from the first paragraph, Lowry builds the strangeness of the world of \"The Giver\" slowly, with revelations that take the story to a fever-pitch. It is a wonderful book. \"Gathering Blue\" has a similar flavor to \"The Giver\" but not the power. Whereas \"The Giver\" reminded me of \"1984\", \"Gathering Blue\" reminded me of \"Planet of the Apes.\" Now, I'm a fan of \"Planet of the Apes\", mind you, but it's not the same thing. Again, in \"Gathering Blue\", there is the story of an anti-utopian future society. Kira is a girl who has lost both of her parents. The book opens with her mourning her mother. Because of her deformed leg, Kira is now at risk of being killed herself as she can no longer contribute to her society made primitive after an event called the Ruin. Her unequalled skill with a needle and thread, however, keep her alive and get her close enough to the power of her society to see its secret horrors. \"Gathering Blue\" is a good story. Certainly better than much of what's out there. What I like about this story even over \"The Giver\" is that it seems almost more real. While reading, I felt that this kind of primitive society could really develop. What it lacks is the tension and surprises of \"The Giver.\" There is little tension in Kira's trial because we know she has to live for the story to go on. There are a couple of surprises in the last few pages but they are not a powerful as in \"The Giver.\" It is a risk to read a book by an author who has written one of your favorite books because it is difficult to beat the comparison. Still, \"Gathering Blue\" is an excellent book and well worth the read. But I would recommend \"The Giver\" to anyone who reads this.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "What if all modern technology vanished? What if the daily struggle for food and shelter became the utmost priority in our world? Who would be considered of value in the society that followed? Ms. Lowry has given readers a story with all the impact of her earlier book, The Giver. Gathering Blue is also a novel set in the possible future, where insular towns and villages have developed, and contact between them is almost nonexistent. In one of these villages, the reader is introduced to a young girl named Kira. Through Kira's eyes, the reader is gradually pulled in to discover the horrifying, and entirely possible, secret of Kira's world. Gathering Blue is absolutely stunning in the concepts it presents; I'm certain that teachers will want to incorporate this powerful book into their reading curriculum. Along with Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli and Matilda Bone by Karen Cushman, Gathering Blue will be among the top contenders for next year's Newbery Award.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Like many readers, I was completely floored by THE GIVER. I had heard Lowry interviewed on NPR, and finding myself in a bookstore not long after, thumbed through the book-- and felt absolutely compelled to buy it. Reading that book I had to look up several times to wipe away tears, and look around at all the beauties of our own world that we so often take for granted-- like the color red-- singing-- and unconditional love. Now, GATHERING BLUE did not have that impact for me. But it's a very good example of a YA novel with a smart, kind heroine in a world that is complex, often brutish, and all to human. Where the world of THE GIVER, we gradually discover, is technologically advanced but emotionally and psychologically regimented, even soul-destroying, the catastrophes have turned the world of GATHERING BLUE to a fierce hunter-gatherer society. It's a world where deformed people are routinely abandoned to death at birth, and where children, or \"tykes,\" are redistributed to other families should one parent die, where parenting is full of shouts and slaps (but also, we see in glimpses, some kisses and handholding) and where those who can't contribute or work in an obvious fashion are ruthlessly discarded. For all that, however, it's a world more familiar to the reader than the world of THE GIVER, and somehow, a friendlier place. Perhaps because family units, however bickering, do exist, or because of the presence of a mischievous child named MATT who even has a pet dog, this world's harshness is less shocking. Everyone in the world is brought up with it, knows about, no secrets there. There are secrets, however. Kira is accused by a Vandara, a woman who wants her land (Kira's cottage was burned after her mother's death from illness), but instead of being kicked out of the community, Kira is promoted to weaver/designer-- she has an unearthly talent for it. As in the world of THE GIVER, there are traces of magic in this universe. She is taken to live in \"the edifice\"-- a cathedral that has survived more or less intact from the war. Unlike the GIVER, there are clues that this is definitely our world. In the song the singer recites each year at the Gathering, which tells the story of mankind, he lists some names of places that exist no more-- and if you read carefully it's obvious that they are Bogota, Baltimore and Toronto. There is also clearly a cross in the Edifice. Nobody remembers what it signifies, but everyone remembers that it's important. As in THE GIVER, however, being promoted for your talented is a mixed blessing. Just as in that world, having a talent is something that people in power find alluring, and the people in power, even when seemingly protective and kind, may not have your best interests at heart, or be telling you the truth. The title refers to the search for woad, the plant that Kira could use to make blue threads-- blue is a color her own township no longer knows how to make. Despite some startling revelations Kira makes a hard choice to work to improve her own society rather than choose a path that would be kinder to her and her crippled status. This is a great example for kids and for all of us. I really liked this book and found a lot in it to ponder. It didn't sock me in the stomach like THE GIVER-- overall it was a more conventional dystopia-- but I enjoyed reading it. Oddly however some of the brutishness and coldness seemed harder to believe in-- I have trouble believing a society so clearly human would be able to resist forging stronger bonds of love and friendship than this society seems to. While it's true that in the middle ages people were more used to death, for example, it's also true from every piece of literature we have from every society everywhere that the altruistic impulse is very strong, as is the parental urge, and it's hard to believe that Kira's loving mother would have been as unusual as all that. But these are quibbles. This is a worthy successor to THE GIVER. It's different and less timeless--I'd recommend the GIVER to everyone, whether or not they read YA or science fiction-- but I'd probably be more selective in recommending this. But it works quite well as a sort of fairy tale/parable. And I loved the reference to Jonas (not named) at the end. He appears to be in a neighboring town. I'm guessing that Jonas' town, the one he escaped from, is the worst of all the societies in Lowry's futureworld. Looking forward to the sequel which will tie them all together. Someone compared THE GIVER to 1984, and this book to PLANET OF THE APES. Actually I'd say in impact if THE GIVER were PLANET OF THE APES (and it's hard to remember now but the ending of that movie was a huge sucker punch) than this book is more like BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. Less shocking, less horrifying, but still very, very interesting, and a quick read with an interesting heroine.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The Giver was my favorite book until I read Gathering Blue! This new book by Lowry is as intriguing as The Giver, and gives the reader more to think about. Science fiction is not my favorite genre, but these books are definitely an exception. Kira, the main character, is a likeable, compassionate young woman who is saved from death because of her talent for embroidery which she had learned from her mother. Matt, her friend is enjoyable in his naivity, but he definitly becomes a valuable friend. Thomas, the Carver, is interesting because of his artistry and background being so similar to Kira's. The theme of the artist as the predictor of the future is an interesting theme. This book explores the value that artist's bring to society, as well as, the importance of community and of love among humans. The idea of the artist being controlled by the state is interesting because of the many struggles our country has against/for censorship in the arts. I would recommend this book to young adults as well as adults.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Who can gather the bluest of the blue in the place that is full of greyness, dark envy, and greed? Kira, a crippled young weaver with an extraordinary skill at the art of embroidery, lives in a medieval-like, primitive, technology-free village full of casual cruelty and brutality. Her father was conveniently killed by \"beasts\", and her mother got sick and passed away, leaving Kira unprotected in this community. But instead of being cast to the beasts, the society's Council of Guardians installs her as a caretaker of the Singer's robe, a ceremonial garment embroidered with the scenes of human history and used at the annual Gathering. Many dark secrets and hidden agendas unravel before Kira as she works on restoration of Singer's robe and learns how to prepare dyes from her teacher Annabella. But the only color that her society has no knowledge of - is blue. The blue is the color Kira needs to restore the scenes of the past on the Singer's robe and to continue working on the scenes of the future. Kira needs to \"gather blue\", gather all her courage to shape the future by following her art, trusting what it \"tells\" her in its mysterious ways, trusting into the better future for her people.

{"review": "Although I greatly admire the writing of Lois Lowry, I was disappointed with this book. It had a compelling premise and the potential to provide an interesting contrast to \"The Giver\". Unlike \"The Giver\", however, \"Gathering Blue\" raises questions that are not satisfactorily resolved in the conclusion of the story. At the end, the reader has ample evidence to doubt that the young characters will be able to bring about a new and brighter society for the brutish and morally challenged people in their community. How long, for example, will it take for the authorities to discover that the young girl has obtained blue thread or the plant capable of producing the color blue? How patient will the authorities be when she begins to stitch a future different that the one they have in mind? How much discretion will the young boy have to carve out a new future on the Singing Stick? How long will it take the Council to discover and destroy the healing community? Indeed, how long will it be before all three young people are deemed to be dispensible, and fall victim to the typical accident or illness? Of course, their special talents may give them some protection, but only until a creative replacement can be found. Consider, for example, the fate of the two women who created beautiful dyes. At the conclusion of the \"The Giver\", one has hope for the main character and his small charge. Escape was the only route for him, and his absence, the only hope for the society he left behind. In \"Gathering Blue\" one sees no real hope that the main character's decision to stay will result in anything other than a senseless and preventable death. Plot elements seemed less well developed than is typical of Lois Lowry's work. For example, why are pages devoted to helping the 3 year old signal her older friends upstairs, when this is a lost element in the story? The idea of name syllables to denote age was a good one, but there are too few examples given to show how the names of the main characters might develop, and no examples of a four syllable man's name to provide any clues. The mystery of the children's talents is also not fully developed. Is magic involved? Moral superiority? A divine gift? Perhaps this is part of the storyteller's plan - to tell less than the reader wants to know. But so many unresolved questions ultimately interferred with my enjoyment of a book I truly wanted to like.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is another excellent book by Lowry. I had first read The Giver, which is also very good. This book gives a different perspective of the far future than The Giver but bears a lot of similarities. Where life in the Giver was all pleasant and happy, in this book, life is rough with everyone fighting each other for what they have. In both books, \"undesirables,\" meaning the old, deformed, or infirm are eliminated from society. As in The Giver, the main character is one who bears a special talent, which is needed to be able to pass on the long ago history of the society. In Gathering Blue, Kira, though born with a clubbed foot, is needed to because she has a special talent for sewing that is beyond what others have. She is tasked with restoring a coat that is to be worn by the singer at the annual gathering. Different sections of the coat depict different stories of society's history. Kira encounters Thomas, a wood carver, who is tasked to repair the staff used by the singer and Jo, a young girl, who is being trained to eventually be the next singer when the current one will \"disappear.\" As in The Giver, the world seems to be devoid of color. Kira spends some of her days visiting with an old woman (Annabella) who has a talent for dying threads. Annabella instructs Kira how to take the dyes from various plants so that Kira can dye the threads to use for the singer's coat. One of the colors that Anabella doesn't teach Kira about is blue. So an important part of the book involves Kira getting the means to make blue and hence the title of the book. After, Anabelle \"talks\" too much, Kira learns that she suddenly died and was taken to \"the field.\" where people are brought after they die. Little by little, Kira starts to realize that all that she believed is a lie and she starts to piece together \"the truth.\" I finished this book in one sitting and my only complaint, as with The Giver, is that the book is too short. Also, it begs for a sequel. The Giver appears that it could take place at the same time as Gathering Blue, but in a different part of the world. Perhaps, Ms. Lowry's intention is to somehow write a sequel book that will bring both books together. I hope that Ms. Lowry continues to write these types of books because I highly enjoy them and see that see has a marvelous talent as a storywriter!", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Gathering Blue is a book, that's great, but not for everyone. To start, I recommned that you read this book only if you are ten or older. Someone younger kids would probably not comphrehend the book that well. I also think you should read the Giver before you read this book. You might understand the theme of different communities more. This book is about Kira, a girl born with a twisted leg and fatherless. In Kira's community, fatherless, disabled children aren't useful and must be thrown to the field, a place where beasts supposdedly roam, waiting to gobble people down. But because of Kira's grandfather, a man of great power, Kira is able to stay alive. When her mother dies, Kira is almost killed, for being useless. But since she has a talent for threading, the powerful council of guardians spares her. They give her her own room, and an assingment. While her talent keeps her alive, Kira discovers secrets of the community in this suspensful book. I loved this book, but at the beggining, I was struggling to get through it. It's confusing and boring at the begginning, so if you don't like books with bad begginnings, then this book isn't for you. All in all, Gathering Blue is a great story or love, secrets, frienship and choices.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Lois Lowry is one of those unique authors who has won the John Newbery Medal for children's literature twice. Once for the first book in this trilogy and once for a book about the Holocaust called Number the Stars. (Just as an aside only one other author has ever done that Madeleine L'Engle who I would also recommend highly.) I would begin by recommending any of her books; they are all worth the time and the effort. This trilogy is set in a post apocalyptic world. The first two books each focus on different community's who have recovered from the devastation differently, both have strengths and both have weaknesses. And a young boy must heal them both and the land if either is to survive.

It didn't worry him, how could someone not fit in? The Community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so carefully made.\" However all the other Twelve's were assigned and Jonas was skipped then at the end of the ceremony it was announced that he had been selected he was chosen to become the `receiver of memory.' He was to learn all the history and story of the people and become an advisor to the council that ruled the village. It only happened every so many generations and only 1 keeper of memories was installed in each village. Jonas and his family take in an infant who is not maturing and growing quickly enough. The child is given a year extension, when the child is marked to me replaced (abandoned and killed). Jonas takes the child and runs away. Through the winter Jonas knows he will not make it and pours all the memories he has learnt into the child. But can he save the child? What will happen to him and his community? Jonas thought his world was perfect, that the elders had everything under control, that there would never be war again. But also a world without choices.

The weak, injured, and helpless are abandoned. However things are starting to turn around for Kira, she has been spared by the all powerful Council of Guardians, for she has a gift she is a weaver and can die cloths in ways no other in the community can. As an artisan she is installed in the palatial Council Edifice and spends the whole year working her trade, her primary task is to care for the Robe of Remembrance that tell's the story of this community. But with her privilege comes expectations that she will do the council biddings. She befriends a young boy and his ragged dog, Matty `The Fiercest of the Fierce'. Matt tells Kira about another village where people are not cast aside, where they share their food. Matt brings her a gift the color blue, and a blind man that is her father.

The Seer can see the future and can often see for people what might be for his people. Matty is almost at the age where he will be named, he is hoping to be named `Messenger' for he takes message both in the village and to other villages which many can not do. But things are changing, the village is becoming hostile, starting to turn people away and the woods are becoming ferial and people are dieing. Can the Leader save the village, can the world be healed, what will happen to Kira, her father and Matty? These three books will challenge you, after reading The Giver the first time I was overwhelmed and it haunted me for a long time. I went back and have reread it many many times. All three books raise questions about community, love, friendship, and care for other people.

In our modern, technological world full of computers and smart phones sometimes it's a relief to take a break from typing or texting to fall back on an old and simple idea like tongue twisters. These are just strings of words that don't easily go together soundwise that you have to try to say as fast as you can. The results can be hilarious. Getting a group of kids together to try to say tongue twisters can provide them with great amusement. A competitive element can be introduced to enhance the enjoyment, and sometimes a young person who is no good at sports or school work will discover a hidden talent for tongue twisters that raises his or her self-esteem. They also have more serious uses. For those whose native language is not English, they can provide excellent practice in pronouncing consonant and vowel sounds. Children with speech difficulties can also use them for practice when alone, and they may play a part in training young singers so that lyrics are heard more clearly. And it's not just kids who love tongue twisters. They also make excellent ice-breakers for work gatherings or seminars, and are more sedate than most drinking games for parties. So the next time the power goes, or you find yourself stuck in a room with a bunch of kids or adults you have to keep entertained, why not get them all to have a go at saying some tongue twisters?", "id": "86"}

{"review": "The Scorch Trials / 978-0-385-73875-0 As full disclosure, I wasn't a huge fan of The Maze Runner - gave it 3 stars, if I recall correctly - but I really love dystopia fiction and I really hate not finishing a series, so my curiosity got the best of me and I picked up The Scorch Trials at my local library, prepared to dive back down into the futuristic mind games perpetuated by W.I.C.K.E.D. First impressions were initially good - the book starts off a lot faster than \"The Maze Runner\", with disaster setting in almost immediately after the daring rescue of the first novel. It's nice to see a dystopian future come up with a creative merge of massive global climate change and zombies, and it's especially good that we start the first chapters off with a strong and steady dose of creepy-bordering-on-terrifying. After the first few chapters, though, the paces slows drastically, and the novel starts to suffer from \"middle series syndrome\". Despite being out of the Maze and immersed in the \"real\" world, we actually learn very little of the details of this dystopian future, which makes it very difficult for the reader to connect to the global problems that W.I.C.K.E.D. is supposedly trying to solve, which makes it hard to get attached to these increasingly nebulous \"experiments\" that are somehow supposed to come up with some kind of cure...for something. Around the halfway mark, it starts to feel like we're killing time to get to the end of the book so that we can then get the THIRD book and find out some actual answers, and after awhile one starts to wonder if the ending will be worth it. And then the reader actually does get to the ending, only to find that really one could skip over this second novel entirely and be none the worse for wear - just like the first book: nothing is explained, everything is a mystery, please buy the next book, kthxbye. Some of the things I didn't like about \"The Maze Runner\" the first time around crop up again here. Thomas continues to have more than a whiff of Mary Sue about him; way too much angst is expended on the designated love interests (and, really, I think Thomas has more romantic chemistry with Newt than with either of the two girls provided here); and almost the entire \"cast\" of Gladers are anonymous red-shirts - in fact, whenever anyone other than Minho, Newt, or Thomas is suddenly granted a name and/or minor personality, it's pretty much a given that they're about to die horribly for insta-angst. I understand that it's difficult to write a group of 20+ well-rounded individuals, but Thomas' continued insistence on not learning the names or personalities of the people fighting and dying around him starts to inadvertently make him seem like a psychopath or - immersion-breakingly - the only important character in a story. I guess a recommendation for The Scorch Trials depends on your reaction to The Maze Runner; if you loved the first book and want more of the same, this sequel delivers. If you were less than completely enthralled with the first novel, however, and are more interested in answers than in dragging out the Thomas/Theresa love shipping, I'd recommend giving this book a pass and skipping over to the third book entirely. I didn't feel like it was a waste of time reading this novel, and there were definitely several high notes in the first half, but I just can't help but feel that it could be a lot better with a little less ham-handed \"mystery\" and a little more character development. A word about the audiobook for this novel: The audiobook is fairly well-narrated. The reader paces and pauses well, although his voice could perhaps be a little more animated during the \"action\" scenes. My favorite parts are when he speaks as Newt, because he brings out this wonderfully outrageous accent that I suppose is meant to be Scottish. Overall, though, the audio is well done and worth listening to. ~ Ana Mardoll", "id": "4"}
{"review": "The Scorch Trials picks up right where The Maze Runner left off and it certainly starts with a bang. James Dashner incredibly makes this installment even better than the first. There is non-stop action and unexpected twists and turns in every single chapter. Thomas is once again thrown into this crazy environment, fighting for his life, as well as the lives of his friends. WICKED is more involved in this one, but we still don't really know much about them. Is WICKED good or is WICKED bad? That really is the question to ask throughout this entire book. Dashner really made me question everything and everyone. Like Thomas, I wasn't sure what to believe. Be prepared for more than a little creepy action going on because the Cranks sure are terrifying. Dashner vividly describes the pure nastiness that exudes from the zombie-like creatures. The short chapters kept me completely enamored with the story. It was more than a little difficult to put the book down because things just keep on happening. Whenever the action seemed to slow, Dashner did something that had my jaw hanging open. I frequently found myself asking what? How? Why? Why? Why? Nothing is what it appears in this book and Dashner perfectly captures Thomas' confusion, his anger, his fear, his every emotion about being thrown into this hellish world and trying to come out of it alive and relatively unscathed. His dreams about his memories were one of my favorite aspects about the book and the tiny clues they offered made me want more and more. The Scorch Trials is a jaw-dropping thriller filled with the most insane and unexpected twists. Dashner will blow your mind with everything that WICKED puts the Gladers through and for every question raised, we get the teeniest insight into what is really going on. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and have you begging for the final installment. Opening line: She spoke to him before the world fell apart. ~ pg. 1 Favorite line(s): He didn't care about the others anymore. The chaos around him seemed to siphon away his humanity, turn him into an animal. All he wanted was to survive, make it to that building, get inside. Live. Gain another day. ~ pg. 136", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Food to eat while reading: Scorched Crème Brulee ([...]) I am not usually a fan of middle books in a series, but this middle book in The Maze Runner series reads like a great beginning--all over again. What I liked: The setting kept changing and with each new place came dangers, creatures and people that kept me on the edge of my seat. The main characters remained consistent and believable, yet they changed and grew from their experiences, like good little characters should. In fact, I almost cheered at the end for Thomas on the last page when he makes a difficult decision. Hooray for characters that change and show us that we can too. Brenda, and Jorge are a great addition to the cast. They throw more variables into the equation and complicate the trials. And I love that Dashner introduced a second love interest for Thomas. Let the cat fights begin! The balance of intrigue in this story is perfect. The questions and answers are braided together so that I am always wondering what will happen, but satisfied by the questions I have already received. Dashner has gained my trust, and though I still have unanswered questions, I am willing to read through quite a bit before I get the answers because I know that he will deliver. I am eager to see why all of these horrible things are happening to these kids and how Thomas had a hand in creating the trials that he now is subjected to. I have an idea of why the variables are there and what the patterns are for, but I am content to wait until 2011 for The Death Cure. I can't wait to see this on the movie screen-it will lend itself easily to media. What I would have changed: The Scorch Trials is quite a bit more violent than The Maze Runner. My son is currently reading the first book and I am unsure about giving him the second one just yet. It bothered me that Aris' character is so underdeveloped. He mozies along with the Gladers, only showing spunk when he is required to act out a role for WICKED. Perhaps the author has hidden Aris from us for a reason and we will see his character unfurl in The Death Cure. Much of the jeopardy was killed for me by a scene in the middle of the book. I just didn't worry so much for Thomas' safety and that led to a loss of intensity. The verdict: The Scorch Trials is an excellent addition to the very popular dystopian genre. It will leave you scratching your head and chomping at the bit to read on.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "As I start The Scorch Trials, all I can think is, why do they bother? I understand that when pushed, humans have a very strong survival instinct. But I feel like these kids have been pushed beyond the farthest limits you could set, and are still expected to keep going. With no trust in WICKED, and no security in the promise of a safe haven, why bother? At one point, Thomas does mention revenge against WICKED as his motive for pushing through his impending meltdown, but I just can't see revenge being worth it at this point. I guess that wouldn't make me a very good candidate! Anyways, its these thoughts that permeate my experience of The Scorch Trials. I had a hard time getting in to the story, as I felt how tired the Gladers were, especially Thomas, and it made me tired. Their acceptance of their inability to change anything made me feel hopeless and again wonder, why bother? For me, Dashner is unable to distinguish between creating suspense and just being plain annoying. I admit, I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of this book, as the twists were unpredictable. The problem I now face, is that I am left with next to no resolution. I waited in anticipation for almost 400 pages to find out that I have to read the next instalment to get any answers. Yes, bits and pieces were revealed, but nothing that really added to what I already knew from The Maze Runner. This does not sit well with me. I found myself having to put down the book and walk away because I was so frustrated with the lack of answers. And so many of the various plot twists introduced seemed needless and just added to my overall frustration, like Dashner was just making things up as he went. This gave the book an almost careless and unplanned feel, like a lot of the looses ends won't be explained because they weren't given much original thought. I'm sure in the next book I will finally get some type of resolution, but I feel like there should have been something given in this to make me WANT to pursue the next instalment. Instead, if I want to know anything, I HAVE to read The Death Cure. Seems like a pretty dirty and sneaky way to make sure I don't stop halfway through the trilogy. My next problem is that throughout the entire book, there is no sense of time passing...like, at all. When I got near the end, and the Gladers announced they had only 3 days to get to the safe haven, I was genuinely shocked. It was the first indication that any significant amount of time had passed (that I noticed) and the fact that almost two weeks had passed really surprised me. Part of me wondered how it took them so long to get to their destination, then I remembered they were supposed to be covering 100 miles. All the times they spent running kind of blurred together, and I kept catching myself wondering how long the Gladers had spent running, and how it was physically possible for them to run for such long periods of time. I probably missed sections of the plot contemplating how a person could run that often, on such little amounts of food/water in a desert-like landscape. Finally, continuing from The Maze Runner, I don't really care for any of the characters. I was glad to see Minho took more of a main role, but I still can't relate to Thomas (who has next to no personality, considering he spends half of the book sleeping or knocked out), I can't stand Teresa (she's all over the place!) and the other more minor characters all kind of blend together - we don't even know all of the Gladers' names, even though by the end, there's only 11 of them. I did like the introduction of Brenda, even though she freaked me out a couple times, but I didn't care for the love-triangle (kind of) thing that was happening between her, Thomas and Teresa. Overall I feel pretty meh about this, and will only read The Death Cure to find out why they were put through all of this in the first place.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I am a 30-something woman who enjoys reading Young Adult dystopian/sci-fi/fantasy novels. My local YA librarians have been talking this series up as something that I'd *love.* Um, sorry...but no. The Maze Runner was okay, not great. It started with a good premise, but lacked fleshing out. The overused, made-up slang -- and the suspense & gore -- were irritating as the novel progressed. But any-hoo, this review is for THE SCORCH TRIALS. Second verse, same as the first. Well, not really because I think Book 2 was not as good as Book 1. A simple summary: 1. WICKED: \"Haha, punked you. Reset, do-over, but TOUGHER!\" 2. Gladers: Hot desert, walk, walk, walk. LIGHTNING!!! Walk, walk, walk. ZOMBIES!!! Walk, walk, walk. BETRAYAL, oh the pain! 3. Thomas: I'm not a leader. I'm a leader. Theresa? Brenda? I'm confused! I'm angry! My feelings are hurt! 4. WICKED: \"Haha, you made it to the safe haven, but we tricked you! More lightning! More bio-creatures! Just wait and see what we have in store!\" 5. James Dashner: \"Oh yeah, hehe, tricked you again. Read Book 3.\" Seriously, though.... the one main thing that bothered me was the pitting of Group A vs. Group B. Both groups of kids had been manipulated and tortured and abused at the hands of the same group. And now, one of those groups is willing to harm the other because the abusers told them to...in exchange for their freedom/cure? And they believe them, after all the lies....really?!?", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I did like the Maze Runner - until the end when the entire construct of a 2 year experiment in a massive artificial environment that involved many deaths of youths seemed largely unjustified and, regardless of money and technology available, totally unrealistic in a post apocalyptic world. To me, after reading the Scorch Trials, it really seemed like Dashner's whole talent is directed at depicting curiosity and suffering simply for the sake of doing so. The story arc is ridiculous - just putting mystery after mystery on top of suffering and pain and then, at the end, trying to patch the story together with a weak explanation of WICKED and its goals. I suppose an angst ridden teen might like this just for the emotional stimulation but as a story, I was just frustrated and annoyed. Reading a spoiler synopsis of the 3rd book didn't encourage me to continue with the series - rather it convinced me to pack it in and move on. The problem is that the entire story would make much more sense if the experience was taking place inside the minds of the characters as they slept in a Matrix-type storage. But that would be lame. So placing the story in the real world is much better because it defies that cliche. But putting Thomas and his friends through trials that seem like they're from a video game is also ridiculous if the reason for doing so isn't good enough. And the reason for doing so, not to mention the credibility of the resource management required for doing so, isn't good enough. The justification for the suffering of characters (and we the readers as we empathize with them) isn't nearly good enough to make this a satisfying story.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "I loved this book, frankly the crazy, hap hazardous, rushed, psychotic things that happened fit perfectly with the plot line. The whole point of the Maze Runner and the Scorch Trials are to trick the readers' heads. Do we trust Teresa? Who is Brenda? Thomas should be the leader! No Minho should! The whole trilogy is an experiment on us, we don't know what is real, or what is fake, and at the end of the day we don't know if WICKED really is good or bad. Thomas, wow what a character. Since we're basically living in his head and experiencing his emotions I feel for him. Do you trust your best friend? Isn't she the Betrayer? I completely understand why he's concerned about WICKED when the only things he can remember from it, are tests, subjects and Teresa. Scorch Trials is a harder book than Maze Runner because people die in the book for seemingly no reason. I mean we know it's for `patterns' and `killzones' but it is so seemingly pointless from Thomas and the other Gladers' perspective. How does lightning killing roughly half of your group help these `patterns'? And who do you trust when Cranks try to shoot you and drug you up. I trust Dashner though and know that what he reveals in the final book will be completely unexpected yet perfectly fit with everything we have gone through. I don't know how I personally feel about WICKED, throughout the entire story they are eluded to being good, to trying to save humanity, yet their actions show otherwise. What was the point in the final battle? Were they really trying to wheedle down their `perspective candidates' but then what about the rest? I read this book in three hours because it was that good and I couldn't put it down. I feel as if Dashner captured human character and emotion perfectly. You have to remember these kids lived together in the Glade first, they know about death and dangers and how WICKED can change things in the blink of an eye. It doesn't take much more to believe that WICKED would set up elaborate games and plans that would force people into doing something they don't want to. They have the power of life and death absolutely. After so long of being under that kind of power you either are dead or accept it. I am anxiously awaiting the third book, and know that it's going to be one heck of a kicker.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Book 1- the Maze runner was awesome. Book 2- The Scorch Trails was painful. James Dashner said in an interview that he came up with the whole story and mapped it out in 2 hours. Nuff said. He had a couple cool ideas, spaced them out over 3 books, and just FILLED and FILLED and FILLED the spaces in between with material that was so stretched out it was as thin as dental floss. I was so mad I actually wanted to punch this book. Dashner can take something as simple as a person taking a bite out of an apple and turn it into an entire chapter. Describing how the apple was eaten, the surroundings, and shade of light, the emotions of the person eating the apple...DASHNER I DONT CARE ABOUT THE APPLE!! LOTS of emotions in this book. Too much to deal with. It got to where I was actually just scanning pages quickly looking for something that might be important. In the first book he developed the characters well and I liked them quite a bit, but in the second book that development ended, and he proceeded to repeat the same emotions of the characters over and over. Dead Horse...comes to mind. The only thing that keeps you reading is that you MUST find out what the heck is going on here, and still....you never find out. I haven't read book 3 yet, but i HAVE TO READ it so I can get some conclusion. Do I want to read it? NO! As far as I'm concerned, book 2 could have been completely eliminated. Skipped. At the end of book 2 we're still at the exact same place as the end of book 1!!!! HAHAHAHA I'M NOT JOKING. I swear it, Dashner, after paying $9 + $9 + $16 for grand total of $34 for these 3 books.....you BETTER deliver with this last book. Otherwise you owe me at least $26 (book 1 was good, I don't mind that I payed for that one). With all that said, I'm optimistic about book 3. I'm holding it in my hand right now. I want to believe. I notice the back of the book says \"THE TIME FOR LIES IS OVER\". Well I guess he listened to the reviews. I really really hope that he redeems himself with this book. I will be reviewing book 3 very soon.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Although book one had its ups and downs, I enjoyed it well enough to want to read book two. Admittedly, I didn't expect book two to be better than book one, nor even quite as good, so I wasn't exactly disappointed with what I got. If I could, I would have awarded book one a 3.5 stars. I would award book 2 3 stars. The book suffers from many of the problems I had with book one. Only a few characters are really developed, the writing is poor and the author relies on telling rather than showing. There seemed to be more deaths in book two, and I found a lot of them to be senseless and kinda boring. The deaths didn't really fit into the idea of a trial - they just sort of seemed to be random/bad luck, with little indication that the one killed could possibly have avoided their (often gruesome) fate. Although The Scorch Trials was an easy read, I did struggle at times. Large parts of the story seemed to drag. Some events seemed utterly pointless. I didn't find the setting/world as interesting as the Maze, nor were the Cranks as interesting or as scary as the Grievers. The book hasn't really answered any questions by the end of the book, and I didn't really find that the setup for the third book was all that hooking. I'll be reading book three just so I can finish the series and see what happens, but I'm not in too much of a hurry to do so. I think I'll read something else first. I was sorry that the author didn't improve much on some of the weakness of the first book. If anything, characters felt LESS developed here than the did in The Maze Runner. A few new characters were introduced, but I didn't find any of them interesting. Nor did I care what happened to any of the group. Aside from the main group, any character given a name was almost guaranteed to be dead within a few chapters. I found it annoying how predictable it was. I didn't like Thomas much in the first book. I felt he was too perfect. My opinion of him was even lower by the end of Scorch Trials. I felt that he made NO connection whatsoever to the others in his group - he only cared about his few select friends. When someone died, all he cared about was whether anyone he was friends with was dead. He seemed more distressed when he killed a Crank than he did when one of the group members was killed. There's a point about halfway through the story where WICKED make an appearance to \"save\" Thomas. I found the whole thing pointless and it removed ALL feeling of threat or danger from the book from that point forwards. I wish I could discuss the issue in more specific detail, but I don't want to give away too many spoilers. All I can say is, something happens to Thomas, WICKED show up and take him away, then when they return him to the group all is sorted out and that's pretty much the end of it. There are no consequences for the whole incident. It might as well have never happened. For new readers, I'm not sure whether I'd recommend they even bother with this series at all. The Maze Runner doesn't really work very well as a standalone title, and the second book is only really an okay read.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Much to my regret, I did not like this book. \"The Maze Runner\" originally intrigued me because of the setting and the vividly presented characters. Unlike many recent young adult books, it killed characters, but seemed to be weighing itself before doing that. The same cannot be said about \"The Scorch Trials.\" The intriguing setting is totally gone; the maze is in the past and up to half way through the book, which is as far as I got before I dropped it in the trash, what I was reading was the Bataan death march with kids. It wants to remind you of \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but it sure as hell isn't. This crap is typical modern YA torture porn. No other excuses. The cast consisted of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and seventeen anonymous redshirts just waiting to be killed. And that's all that happened. If you can get past the torture porn, maybe the book gets better, but I'm sick of that. YA authors, please try to emulate what J.K. Rowling did well rather than what Stephanie Collins did in \"Mockingjay\"... I'm sick of nonsensical bloodbaths being passed off as interesting.", "id": "4"}

Two children are traumatized by their mothers death and decision by their Dad to go to war. Adult Penny and her sister were verbally abused by their parents. This book was really hard to read because of the emotional pounding everyone gets for the first half of the book. No bright spots, just emotional beating after beating. It lightens up a little after that, and the last 3 chapters everything was tied up in a tidy bow. Except for the Jewish man, I felt that all of the trauma was too easily overcome and settled. This is not one of Lynn Austin's better books, it was a relief when I finally got to the end.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Over the weekend, I described Lynn Austin's recent book, While We're Far Apart, like an intricate symphony. It begins with a rather straightforward melody: Penny watches as the man she pines for leaves for War on the eve of the American involvement in WWII and offers recklessly to take care of his two motherless children in hopes of securing his love upon his return from duty. Shaking feelings of worthlessness long instilled from her over-bearing parents, Penny steps outside the front door of the house she has always lived in and charges toward a new future. On the eve of his departure, widowed Eddie tries to ignore the pleas of his two young children begging him to stay. They don't want Penny to move into their Brooklyn Apartment and usurp their dead mother's space. They, instead, want their father to stay home from the war. Eddie leaves to converse with Jacob Mendel, his Jewish landlord and another tune strings in. Jacob's wife Miriam and Eddie's wife Rachel were both killed in the same untimely accident. As ramification, Jacob has lost his faith in Hashem ---- God seems so far away although the rabbi and his wife try desperately to tug the former elder back to the life of the synagogue. And then, climactically and with discordance, the local synagogue is prey to an act of arson and a seemingly faraway hatred is brandished like a cymbal- jolt into the present. The tune evokes a haunting change as more instruments are melded into each deft cadence and more bars are added to prolong the unraveling symphony. Dense orchestration including the introduction of new friends; wisps of letters from Jacob's son and his wife in war-torn, Holocaust Hungary, and deep whispers of secrets from loved ones near and far merge to create a seamless piece. There are themes of love and pursuit; of anger, of hatred of a clashing war. Of the brisk touch of this world and the world beyond. It is an almost perfect rendering of a tumultuous time. Austin never writes without an over-arching theme and in While We're Far Apart, the seeming absence of God is most resonant. Jacob followed and meditated on the words of the Torah steadfastly only to find the seams of his world tearing and his life falling apart. Penny isn't sure how to believe in God: when she repeats over and over again all of her shortcomings. Young Esther and her wordless brother Peter go through the motions of a Sunday Schooled upbringing attempting to reconcile the death of their mother with the faith she seemed to inspire in them. All lives collide and cross--- and yet the Almighty seems painfully silent. While We're Far Apart is a magnificent exposition of God in all of his seeming silences. Is He there when we can't hear Him? ---There whether in the materialization of Christian or Jewish tradition? Even amidst a Holocaust recalling the treacherous reign of Haman and the unlikely heroism of Queen Esther? Amidst persecution, death and unwarranted vandalism? How can we pick up the pieces of our faith if we're not sure where faith leads? What is God doing behind the scenes and how are His silences even more telling than His revelation? The end of the song, the end of the book, empowers the reader to think of God in a personal and enraptured way. He can handle our anger and our despair: our lashings out and our pain..... for it is in these moments that we test our faith to breaking point, shirk any complacency and recognize that years later, when the glass is undimmed, that He was there working out the technical aspects, the last strains and chords of melody and sewing together a music so beautiful our human ears could scarce imagine it.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "The novel opens in Brooklyn, New York in the fall of 1943 during WWII. Eddie Schaffer age 33 and his two children, 12-year-old Esther and 9-year-old Peter live in a small apartment upstairs from their landlord, Jacob Mendel. A year prior, Eddie's wife Rachel was killed together with his landlord's wife, Miriam. Eddie is having difficulty coping with Rachel's death and decides to enlist in the army throwing the entire family for a loop. The children had already lost their mother and feared losing their father in battle. Eddie's mother, Grandma Shaffer, lives next door to the Goodrich family who has a daughter Penny, aged 24. Penny's parents are older, quite strict and have sheltered Penny her entire life, always telling her she had no more sense than a green bean. As a result poor Penny suffers from terrible fear of being on her own and afraid of the world at large, although she holds a job as a ticket agent at the local bus station. Unbeknownst to Eddie, Penny has had a crush on him for years and years and always wished Eddie had married her instead of Rachel. She cried her eyes out when she learned Eddie was getting married. Now enlisted in the Army and ready to head off for basic training, Eddie needs someone to care for young Esther and Peter. His own mother, Grandma Shaffer is adamant that there is no way possible she can look after two young children and is completely dead set against Eddie enlisting but Eddie had already enlisted sending Grandma into quite a dramatic tizzy. Penny steps forward and offers to care for the children herself with her underlying motive being that Eddie will fall in love with her and marry HER this time. Soon Penny and children are ensconced in Eddie's apartment, living above Jacob Mendel who is suffering with his own problems. His son, Avraham traveled to Hungary five years ago to study the Torah, met and married Sarah and they had a daughter together whom they named Fredeleh, but now all three of them are missing! Young Esther is struggling in Sunday school asking the teacher why there are wars, why her mother died in the car accident and asks: \"Why doesn't God just kill all the evil people himself\". Her teacher tells the class they should pray for their loved ones who are off fighting in the war but Esther can't accept that as an answer and inquires: \"Even if we pray and pray, God doesn't stop people from dying, so what good does it do\"? How many of us have asked that very same question during our own journey of faith? In the meantime, poor little Peter seems to have lost his ability to talk once his father went off to war and is frightened. He writes a note on his chalkboard for his sister saying: \"I don't know what's wrong. I try to talk and nothing comes out. Help me!\" Esther doesn't know what to do and won't ask Penny for any help as she despises Penny and thinks that she is trying to replace her mother. But Penny, at this point, couldn't be much help as she herself has no self-confidence, always telling herself she can't do things and always makes a mess of everything. These put-downs are old tapes playing in her head that her parents have pounded into her since she was a young child. They continue to treat Penny as a child and make her feel as though everything that happens is her fault. Yet somehow she found the inner strength and courage to move out of her parents home and care for Eddie's children. Downstairs, Jacob Mendel has lost his Jewish faith completely. Esther and Peter visit Mr. Mendel after school each day to help him around the house. Esther begins to seek answers about God, prayer and faith from Mr. Mendel but he doesn't know how to help Esther or what to say to her. He too has lost faith in his religion and his God. He finally explains the story of Joseph and the coat of many colours and tells the children that: \"Faith is believing even when you cannot see it\". But, does Jacob himself still really believe that? Due to Esther's persistence and questions, and Peter's sad eyes, Jacob was beginning to come out from under the veil of darkness and unbelief he had been under for the past year and a half. Jacob decides that he and the children will invite Penny in celebrating \"Purim\", which is the feast of \"Queen Esther\" from the Bible. Keeping with tradition, Jacob tells the children that instead of him telling the story, they will each read the story together with everyone taking a part. Of course, Esther will play the part of Queen Esther and Peter will be Hashem (The Man or God). They will also bake the traditional \"Hamantaschen\" (cookies). During Jacob's planning of the party he realizes he is truly happy. As the relationship between Mr. Mendel, the children and Penny begins to grow, they come to learn together about faith, loss, love, and forgiveness. There are so many other exciting parts in this story that I don't want to give anything else away. But there are a few morals in this story that I believe are important for all of us to remember. We need to remember that God is always there, even when we can't see Him or hear Him. Even when we think our prayers are not being heard, they are, just not always in the way we'd like them to be. It is and has always been God's will that shall be done, not ours! Even during silence and painful hardships, God is still there. Sometimes we must travel through hardships in our lives in order for us to learn something or to understand something. Without hardships we wouldn't be able to grow in our faith. We need to trust God and live our lives as humble servants, even when we cannot see, even when we feel tired of looking and want to give up. God is ALWAYS there, even when He is silent. This is also an important story that talks about the atrocities that were placed upon the people of Jewish faith during the war, in my opinion, one of the saddest and most hurtful of all times in history. Lynn Austin has once again written a riveting story. A story that you'll remember long after the last page has been turned. It's the type of book you'll want to read again and again. This is one story you can't miss!!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Excited by the description and the stellar reviews, I was eager to pick this one up. It was a quick read but in the end lacked the complexity and content that one would expect. I might recommend this book for a mature 6th-grader writing a book report, but as an adult I was disappointed. While the book is clearly character driven (the descriptions of the \"Brooklyn\" setting could have been Anywhere, USA), the characters themselves seemed to be so stereotypical and poorly developed beyond the basics: the struggling middle-class family, the young enthusiastic soldier, the orthodox Jew, the closed-minded bigot, etc. The letters from Hungary, describing the plight of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation, felt mostly like a tool for the author to educate the reader about basic WWII history rather than supplement the story. What was most unappealing was the simplistic nature of the characters and dialogue; essentially boiled down to a young adult level but with the serious overtones of an adult topic. Overall the development of the book was overly thin and predictable, and the ending a little too saccharine for me to swallow. As if real life could be wrapped up in such a neat little bow!", "id": "17"}

I felt that by taking so long to get to the end the ending itself was rushed. I would have like to have learned more about Mr. Mendels son and his wife and their story in capitivity. The story weaves many tales together and is well written it just doesn't have that passion that some of the other books have had. It is a well written novel just a little to long and tied up to neatly at the end.", "id": "17"}

I love that the \"Far Apart\" theme was carried out in many ways through the various characters and the fact that Mr. Mendel kept reinforcing the idea that we should stop at nothing to find those we love. The author did a good job developing the characters. I genuinely cared about what happened to them and felt the anguish of Esther as she desperately searched the news for information about the area her father was. Mr. Mendel was probably my favorite character. I felt his heartache throughout the book and loved how he grew as a person throughout the story.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "Talk about strange job descriptions, Gabby St. Clair is a crime scene cleaner. It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. She can restore a scene to, if not it's original appearance, at least to something the average person can look at without throwing up. At first this seems like a routine job, until Gabby turns up the murder weapon someone used to kill the wife of a powerful politician, someone tries to burn down the house with Gabby inside, and her employee is in jail on an arson charge. Gabby St. Clair is a spunky, spirited stubborn heroine who is on a mission to track down a cold-blooded killer. She is also trying to fend off Riley Thomas, her new, good looking neighbor, and detective Chip Parker, who bears a strong resemblence to Brad Pitt. Hazardous Duty is a delightful blend of humor and suspense, with a cast of quirky characters and a twisted plot that will keep the reader turning pages to the end.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "Gabby St. Clair wants to be a CSI specialist. She's always loved science and mystery. Family trouble demanded her time and she didn't finish college. Now, she's given up her dream so she can clean up after murders, assaults and the occasional cat lady. But with her inclination toward crime solving, Gabby can't help but notice some things don't add up at the site of a murder. And when she takes her suspicion to the police, she's met with incompetence or maybe it's a cover-up. And then a bomb shows up on her doorstep. She's definitely making someone nervous. Hazardous Duty switches pace from comedy to spine tingling suspense with quick deft skill. Barritt has a great cast of odd-ball characters backing up her heroine: a way-too-cute new neighbor who stacks up to be a bum like Gabby's dad; a vegan who is willing to give a pro-animal speech at the least provocation; and a cop who looks like Brad Pitt and who might be trying to kill Gabby. Hazardous Duty by Christy Barritt as much fun as I've had reading a book in a while. I feel like Christian fiction, which I love and write, has just turned a corner with this book. It's as funny and fast paced as any book, created with Christian readers in mind with no offensive language or situations--unless picking skull fragments out of a wall offends you--which is possible. It's pure entertainment with a Christian worldview. - Debbie W. Wilson, [...]", "id": "18"}

{"review": "I didn't know you could make such a difficult subject so funny. I guess it would be like writing comedy from an undertaker's perspective. You'd have to find something amusing about your icky job to make it bearable. Gabby begins the story cleaning a crime scene and picking up fragments of the murder victim's skull while mentally composing jingles to promote her business. Then she discovers evidence that the crime scene investigators missed and everything goes downhill from there. She keeps feeling ignored by the people who were supposed to be solving the crime and thus decides to figure it out herself, making matters worse for herself with each new discovery. The romantic tension in the story is fabulous as well. I felt for Gabby when she finally started feeling close to a man and then a monkey wrench was thrown in. Poor Gabby felt like a \"project\" and not a person when her hopes were dashed. And that near-kiss was amazingly-well done. The best part of this story (besides the amazing sarcastic humor and hot guys) was that I wasn't any more sure of the true killer's identity than Gabby was. Her conclusions made sense, but then little tidbits of evidence detracted from her conclusions and made her more confused. Then when the killer is revealed, it makes sense, but I never suspected the person whodunit! So though this story had suspense/thriller moments, it also had a cozy chick-lit feel to me because an amateur was trying to solve a murder. The author did a fantastic job engaging the reader and thickening the plot. This was a top-notch suspense, in my opinion. It had all of the elements of the perfect novel. If you like murder mysteries and suspense with a chick-lit feel, you'll want to read this one!", "id": "18"}
{"review": "This book didn't have a clue what it wanted to be. A sales pitch on Christianity? The Christian commentary was very bizarre. Just when you're starting to become interested in the storyline of the book, up pops this extremely irrelevant and out of context religious discussion. The jumps are so poorly done and are so extreme that it completely and effectively takes you out of the now of the storyline, and wanders around until you're bored and REALLY begin to think that the book just isn't worth the silly sidetrack this author feels compelled to take every chapter. I don't have anything against religious themes or storylines, but the way these were placed in the book were just very poorly done. Also, I got sick of the author repeating ad nauseam that Science + Christianity = OK (as long as you don't believe in Evolution). One statement of this opinion would have been more than enough to make her point, and placing it appropriately in the book would have been essential. A romance novel? If the author was attempting a romance novel, she needs to direct her attention to a different subject matter. There was more chemistry between the parrot and the protagonist than there was between the two men with whom she is supposed to have an attraction. A mystery? What mystery? I had the perpetrator figured out, immediately, and was bored with the protagonist's futile and bumbling search throughout the rest of the book. The whole thing was very haphazard. There was no there there. A comedy? The attempts at comedy were so lame, it was downright painful. Everything felt forced or fell flat on the ground with a very loud THUD (can you feel the comedy?) A CSI-type crime scene story? She finds a hair, uses a pair of tweezers, a plastic bag and saves the day? Really? Seriously???? A thriller? Wow...a burning house, pipe bomb and locked in a trunk. Tired, tired, tired (and I wasn't thrilled in the least). Basically, the author attempted all of these things, and succeeded at none of them. She needs to pick a style and work on becoming effective in that genre, before putting everything in a metaphorical blender and hoping it doesn't make the reader sick to their stomach while drinking the mixture. Lastly is the author's most heinous mistake: Who the heck is Timmy? While locked in the trunk of a car, the protagonist dreams about Timmy and Timmy being kidnapped. What?! Where did Timmy come from? Did this happen in another book by this author and she just decided to use it as filler for this book? Perhaps she felt it would make the scene feel more thrilling if she brought up something about a different kidnap to make this kidnap seem more frightening? Instead, it came out of nowhere and was just completely nonsensical. This book is an F.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "If you are in the mood for a Christian mystery novel, this would be a good read. I was not aware that I was picking up a Christian novel (my fault for not reading the book description very closely). The beginning of the book seemed really fun, the premise seemed OK and the writing was keeping me interested in the story. Then the \"out of the blue\" faith doubting stuff started to appear in the story. It seemed very out of place for what was going on in the story at the time. I decided to plug along in the book and see if the story would save the preaching. It did not. I feel like the faith questioning thoughts of Gabby seemed out of place in the story and seemed to be shoved in there willy nilly. On the other hand, the faith of Riley seemed to flow very smoothly in the story. The story totally lost me when the author decided that someone with a science related background was questioning evolution. That was what made me put the book down and delete it from my Kindle. I do not mind a book where a character's faith or spirituality is an integral part of the story. This one seemed like it was another attempt at stealth Christianity and was meant to convert the heathens rather than tell a good story. The author seems to be very good at writing a story and I would have loved to have finished it if it wasn't for the blatant attempt at trying to convert people to Christianity. I would love to see a cozy mystery written by her without all of the religion in the story. From the 30% of the book that I did read, she seems really talented. I will check back to see if this author does write a secular cozy mystery.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "I applaude the author for her attempt at writing a book. However, she should take some lessons from more successful writers. The book was annoying, at best, due to overuse of corny and redundant metaphors and sarcastic asides that contributed nothing to the storyline, but did irritate the devil out of me. Then there is the thing about her brother who was kidnapped at sometime in the past, but we never learn what it was all about. Why put it in the story? Oh, and the idiotic main character who seems to have a death wish as she routinely ignores advice from her friends and police not to interfere with an investigation. The whole thing was just so unbelievable. I did manage to finish the book because I don't like to quit. I probably should have.", "id": "18"}

While some here have expressed an annoyance at the Christian theme, I actually felt as if it was not fleshed out enough. Maybe because the book ended too soon? Is this the beginning of a series? Because if it's a series I guess I could understand the way it ended, though I was left feeling just a tad bereft. But not so much that I was upset. I might even hunt down the next book if there are any. The Christianity to me seemed a bit forced - as if it were tacked on the end of the people's lives. Flesh that part out more, in my view.

Even though her circumstances don't sound all that rosy, Gabby is a vibrant character who you can't help but fall in love with and cheer for. Somehow, Gabby and her friends find themselves in the middle of a murder investigation into the death of the wife of a man with ambition for the top seat of government, someday.

I usually don't like endings that leave loose ends unresolved, but in this case, the author has achieved her purpose in leaving me longing for more, and I'm glad the follow-up book is only two months away. Annie's People is destined to be a series as compelling as Abram's Daughters. It is equally as well-written and absorbing, with wonderful insight into this often mysterous and misunderstood culture. I hope it's ok to add this here, but I want to recommend an obscure book that Beverly Lewis fans are sure to embrace.

{"review": "New York Times bestselling author Beverly Lewis has made a name for herself exploring the lives of Amish women, and in THE PREACHER'S DAUGHTER, the first installment of her Annie's People series, she shows why she's become one of inspirational fiction's queens of the gentle read. Where does responsibility to family, church, and community give way to an individual's God-given gifts and talents? Lewis explores this question through the character of 20-year-old Annie Zook, the daughter of an Old Order Amish preacher. Annie and her family live in a remote area of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, appropriately called \"Paradise\" (a real place, by the way). From her earliest years, Annie has loved to draw and paint, but at six, her father shamed her when she drew a black kitten. Since then, Annie has hidden her artwork from her family. She despairs of choosing between her art and her desire to be a dutiful daughter, and doesn't understand why her church has forced her into making this choice. \"It annoys me no end that some Amish bishops allow for artistic expression, permitting their people to create and sell art, while our bishop does not.\" There's more guilt. Although Annie loves Rudy Esh, she isn't willing to put aside her art, join the church, and marry him. He's moved on to a new sweetheart, and Annie finds herself obliged to be polite to them both, although she still cares for him. It's impossible to carry a load of guilt like this alone, and Annie's safety valve is her pen-pal relationship of more than a decade with the newly engaged 22-year-old Louisa Stratford, an art teacher who lives in Colorado. Lewis compellingly shows how both women idealize the life of the other. Louisa, who's chafing against her mother's opulent wedding plans for her, finds that \"Excessive extravagance had begun to slowly sicken her toward all she had grown accustomed to.\" Annie is convinced that Louisa has everything anyone could want since she's free to express herself through art; Louisa pines for the simplicity and tight-knit family ways of Annie's Plain folks' life. The subplots create some nice parallel tension to Annie's narrative. Among these are the mysterious disappearance of a young child years ago, perceived rebellion against the church, unsuitable love interests, the long-term effects of tragedy on a family, and the abuse of a young mother. Readers new to Amish culture may be surprised by some of the controversies faced by the characters, especially the \"rebellion\" against her church by Esther Hochstetler for her belief that her salvation is sure. The multiple storylines and points of view, part of Lewis's setting up the new series, are handled fairly adeptly, although two \"prologues\" may be a bit much. There are a few other quibbles. An emergency home birth is rather a cliché for fiction fans (how many novels has this scene been a part of?). Sometimes the description of food at each meal seems more like a menu than a natural part of the narrative (\"Following a supper of lamb loaf, scalloped asparagus, buttered carrots, and homemade bread with Sarah Mae's blueberry jam, and topped off with Mamm's well-loved misty mint salad.\"), although some readers may find this to their liking. Plentiful adjectives describe each scene. THE PREACHER'S DAUGHTER is a sweet tale told with Lewis's practiced hand and sure to delight her fans. Those new to Lewis's novels will especially enjoy the glimpses of Amish life and culture, while longtime fans will appreciate the start of a new series. --- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

Does she go forward with her passion for painting and the creative force that wells within her or does she get baptized into her Amish church? This is no small dilemma. As the dutiful daughter of an ordained minister, the community and her family look on her with high expectations, yet, if she does, her art will be forever denied. Can she live that way? Her indecision has already cost her the lost of her first and only true love, Rudy Esh, and Annie is at a loss for what to do. Unexpectedly, she receives a letter from her longtime pen pal, 22-year-old Louisa Stratford, a renowned art teacher, who is facing her own difficulties and wants to visit her and her Amish community. Arriving in her designer jeans and make-up, Louisa shocks Annie's family who is already afraid of the influence she will have on their daughter and community. Seeking time and distance to think about her own love and work problems, Louisa outwardly transforms and mingles in the Old Order Plain community while learning about their private, public and ceremonial life. Her humour and spunk supports Annie and others, but at what impact? Though Louisa's eyes and actions, I delighted in the author's gentle humour as Louisa adapts to the austere lifestyle without electricity and modern conveniences while experiencing every aspect of life from the Plain style of dress (which is an expression of their faith) to the family order to take the Saturday night family bath. Beverley Lewis does a skillful and well-crafted job in bringing Annie's Amish community of Paradise to life.

Annie Zook is the daughter of an Amish preacher and her place in her Amish community doesn't seem readily apparent to this young girl. In order take her rightful place in the community and to marry the boy that she has always loved she must give up the one thing that means the most to her. Her art. But, Annie can't let this part of her soul go and as a result of this she has lost Rudy to someone else and she finds that this secret of hers is costing her more than she ever thought possible. The only one that seems to understand her fears and anxieties is her friend Louisa. Louisa is a pen pal that Annie has had for years and their friendship has grown with them. They are each at a cross roads in their lives and they turn to the other. What makes this hard is the fact that Louisa is from the outside. Louisa on the other hand is getting ready to walk down the aisle but she's finding that the life she dreamed of just doesn't exist. In a world of opulence she finds that she has nothing. Her friend Annie seems to have the perfect life living in Paradise, Pennsylvania. After canceling the wedding Louisa travels east to spend time with her good friend. This is just what these two young women need. Along the way these two must make adjustments but their friendship will see them through. This was an amazing read. Louisa and Annie were truly wonderfully drawn characters that the reader will care about.

I loved the anecdotal sayings and songs about the shanty boys and the dangers inherent in that business. It was amazing what our ancestors went through in both logging and mining, which are both fascinating subjects to me. The plot was well developed and the characters were complex. I loved that the author didn't have a predictable ending and things twisted and turned a little bit from the standard story structure. Robert was a great hero and very easy to fall for. I hurt for him and his history as a surgeon during the war. I was moved to tears when he needed to perform surgery and Katie prayed for him. It reminded me of Aaron holding up Moses's hands in the Old Testament. His children were realistically portrayed as well. The cook Jigger was something. His transformation in the story over time was heart warming. The heroine, Katie, was a hard worker and it was impossible to not admire her pluck. I think that was one of the things that Robert liked most about her. She wasn't a typical women. She worked hard and didn't nag or complain. That was good to see in a book. Her cooking was so well described I often imagined myself eating what Katie was creating in the kitchen. Those meals sounded yummy. The camaraderie of the camp employees really made this novel special to me. The many characters were distinct and the author included just enough male vulgarity (if you will) to make it really feel like a camp full of men without being gross. In my mind I could smell their BO and I experienced other sensations like the rough pine and scratchy wool because they was so well described. I did find myself scratching my head every time lice and bed bugs were mentioned. Ick. Probably the best part of the story to me was the realistic portrayal of how an abused woman would react when threatened. Even a strong one. I loved how Robert noticed that she was almost too compliant and didn't want to make waves. She was also afraid of male anger. That was well done. I loved how Katie nurtured everyone around her including her brother and Moon Song. The spiritual thread in Sky Pilot's story was also good. I felt like I knew the characters personally. That's good writing.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "'The Measure of Katie Calloway' is the first book that I've read by Serena Miller and I very much enjoyed it! I found Katie's story very sad and heartbreaking. She was married to an abusive husband who (in the first chapter) tried to kill her. Katie, upon learning this, hurriedly left Georgia and her violent husband behind, traveling North with her brother. She ends up in Michigan where she secures a job as a lumber camp cook. Her heart seeks sanctuary in the deep woods. But will trouble find her even here? I liked Katie's, Robert's, Mose's, and Skypilot's characters. The story was entertaining, suspenseful, romantic, and interesting. I read 'The Measure of Katie Calloway' relatively quick and would enjoy reading a sequel - just to see how the character's stories develop. The whole aspect of the lumber camp, wildfires, and shanty boys made me enjoy 'The Measure of Katie Calloway' all the more! I think if you enjoy a good story with romance and a little suspense, then you would enjoy 'The Measure of Katie Calloway'! Recommended! *I received a complimentary copy for my review.

{"review": "I am ready to admit that the first thing that drew me to this book was the title. (It's just kinda neat reading a book where the main character has your name. ;-) After spying my name on the book cover and checking out the back cover, I had a very strong feeling that I was going to enjoy this book. And I did--fully and completely! One of the things I think that this historical appealed to me so much was the unique setting--a logging camp in Michigan right after the War Between the States. Katie's character was really complex and interesting. Beginning as a naïve young girl taken in my the charms of a southern gentleman who, she soon learned was anything but a gentleman, I loved watching her grow into a strong and independent woman determined to protect her brother. Robert, a former doctor turned log-camp owner plagued by what he witnessed during the war, also made for a strong hero. The other lumberjacks also made for interesting, but great, characters. Rough and rugged on the outside, over the winter that Katie spent in the camp, cooking for them, the readers were able to see the softer, more gentlemanly side of them. What an experience! Set in the wilds of the Michigan forest, readers are transported back in time to experience what it would be like to have the job of camp-cook for dozens of rugged lumberjacks with monstrous appetites. It didn't take me long to being cheering for Katie has she fought and overcame ever obstacle--especially when dealing with a jealous Jigger! (haha!) From beginning to end, The Measure of Katie Calloway was a wonderful read to become lost in. This is my first book by Serena Miller, but I can promise you it won't be my last. She has found a new fan in me with this wonderfully special, unique, and touching story of an abused wife who overcomes her fears and builds a new life for herself and her younger brother. A beautiful story that I am sure to reread in the near future. I reviewed this book for Revell.

{"review": "\"The Measure of Katie Calloway\" is a novel that spans land and emotions, filled with colorful descriptions and finger-nibbling moments of unease. When you have an abused character it can be a challenge to make her likeable and not weak. Katie Calloway is no weak heroine. She knew what she wanted and she went after what she needed - to protect her life and that of her brother. I have tremendous respect for her in that role. The setting of the novel was one so well described I could smell the donuts frying on the wood cook stove and hear the whine of chainsaws. Such was the imaginary through the entire novel. The occupation of camp cook for Katie in a setting such as a logging camp was well done. However, there were several things about the novel that didn't move me in my particular reader \"needs\". I didn't feel emotionally attached to the novel. There was a separation between reader and character and I wanted to get closer to Katie. Find out what she was all about and dig within her problems. I wanted there to be a bigger climax to the ending. The story line felt like it deserved something more dramatic between Katie and her estranged husband. Though the novel hasn't been my favorite, the love story ending did make me \"ahh\" and the historical descriptions were good. This review is my honest opinion.

{"review": "I enjoy reading Christian fiction, but this story doesn't read like Christian fiction, it reads like a sermon. Instead of the religion being a part of the character development and the plotting, the author seems to be hell bent, pardon the pun, on beating the reader over the head with heavy-handed sermonizing that drags down the story and makes it hard to wade through. Her ideas about Christianity are more suited to folks who would be shocked by all the fighting of urges that goes on in this book. Her conclusions and statements at times were insulting. It was the fault of the woman, who was told by her doctor she could die if she got pregnant, that her husband turned to a prostitute? Because she asks him to abstain from sex that could lead to a pregnancy that could kill her? The writer has her conclude it was her fault he strays. The heroine even asks her why she can't take female preventatives and the woman blames her Catholicism. Really? What female preventatives were available in the early to mid 1800's? I finished this from sheer stubbornness, but it wasn't an enjoyable book. The book had the most laughable collection of plot elements I've ever seen. It was almost as if the writer wrote a list of all the possible elements of a prairie Christian fiction story and tried desperately to work them all in. We have the grieving widow, the grieving widower, the grieving mother who has lost her only child, the misunderstood and badly behaved little child who just needs love, the reformed alcoholic, the straying husband, the abused wife, the man abused by his father--desperate not to repeat the cycle, the reformed prostitute, the wayward wife who comes home, the cross-cultural marriage between a White man and a Native American woman, the biracial child it produces and the resulting bigotry of the community, there is the rogue who threatens the virtue of our heroine, we have the prodigal son who errs and then returns home, and the woman who the doctors have told she will die if she gets pregnant but who puts her faith in God and gets pregnant again.

It was a wonderful surprise to find out that she wrote Christian romance novels too and I didn't hesitate in buying this book. I've never been more pleased. She writes with her heart and I believe its because she's been through the grief and is narrating from experience.

I'd give this book to someone who has lost a loved one and is in need of inspiration and God's love.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "I usually love Christian fiction but I honestly cannot reccommend this as a good example of Christian fiction. Throughout the story, the main character is constantly battling her growing attraction for the man she works for who wants nothing to do with God. The HUGE irony is that she's not battling her attraction because he's not a believer; she's battling her growing love for him because she's never been able to discover her own \"identity, self-worth, blah blah.\" Let me say that my identity is found in Christ...in Him we live and move and have our being!! I can understand we all struggle against sin but the heart of the issue is she shouldn't have chosen to embark on a relationship with an unsaved man. I've grown up in church and I cannot tell you how many times youth leaders warned us not to date non-Christians because the Bible warns so strongly against it! If you don't have the gospel to bind your marriage together, you have nothing. Not to mention the other woman in the story with her aduluterous husband and how it's her fault for not being able to sexually satisfy him because she refuses to use birth control...he isn't held accountable at all for visiting a brothel to get his needs met and she is legalistic and foolish for not considering the use of birth control when her doctor warned her not to get pregnant again. This book is most definitely not the God-glorifying Christian fiction I so appreciate reading from authors like Francine Rivers and I can't reccommend it.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "I receive many joys from reviewing books. One that is a real rush for me is getting sneak peeks into books destined to be best sellers. I was honored with an early read of C.J. Darlington's entry into the Christian Writer's Guild first novel contest. \"Thicker Than Blood\" was the winner for 2009, and from the first chapter I knew C.J. had penned a winning story. Christy Williams has spent the past fifteen years running. Now she's trying to get her life together and be a successful antiquarian book buyer. But when a first edition book ends up planted in her car, framing her for a crime she didn't commit, will the truth of her real crimes cost her everything she's worked for? After a tragic event robs Christy of her safety, she runs to her younger sister, May...the sister she abandoned without a word after their parents' untimely death. Will May have a heart of forgiveness toward her older sister, or condemn her, just as Christy condemns herself? Filled with unique flavor and genuine relationships, \"Thicker Than Blood\" is guaranteed to strike a chord in your heart. I have two daughters myself: one who is following God and one who has walked away from all she believed. I could easily see this story as their story--minus the ranch! C.J. Darlington is a debut novelist to watch. Her story is rich and has a depth missing in a lot of fiction these days. Her eye for detail and for intriguing setting is sure to mark her as a shining star in the publishing world. In addition, C.J.'s message of faith is authentic without being preachy or over the top. Her presentation of the gospel is not only engaging, but I believe it will reach anyone with it's heart and message of love and hope. \"Thicker Than Blood\" receives high marks from me--five out of five bookmarks, with a first edition copy of \"Chronicles of Narnia\" as a charm. Love to read books about book lovers! Don't miss this stunning debut from an author with a lot of stories yet to tell (I hope!). My thanks to my friends at Tyndale for my copy, and to Jerry B. Jenkins for believing in budding authors!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Oh my....What a wonderful novel by debut author C.J. Darlington (and what does C.J. stand for - she's mysterious as well!). I'll start with the thing that I loved the most - the evangelistic angle. C.J. created characters that real people will connect with. And these characters find out, in normal conversation, why they need Jesus and the possibility their lives have if they accept Christ into their hearts. A very clever way to get the gospel across. But even more clever because the sticking points the characters had, you'll have to read the book to find out what they were, are very common. A strong salvation message that meet seekers where they are. Alcoholism. Physical abuse. Stealing, Lying. Trust issues. Abandonment. These issues and more are explored in this novel. Each of the characters in Thicker Than Blood sound different. The pacing is perfect. The scenes are skillfully set (I grew up on a horse farm in Upstate New York, so I can tell you the horse and farm scenes are very realistic). And the chapter endings make this novel a page turner - one you simply can't put down. A unique and masterfully written novel. Get it and read it - you'll be thankful you did! C.J has posted the first chapter on her website, check it out!", "id": "17"}

I can't wait for her next work of fiction.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "There are just some things out there that can't be bought. And with the love and support won over by newcomer C.J. Darlington, you won't have to bribe too many people to read fiction this good. She's won me over WAY before this debut, \"Thicker Than Blood,\" with an amazing website like Title Trakk, and then just gives me more of a reason to cheer her on! And if a debut weren't enough, she has the support of some legends in the world of Christian entertainment. Authors like James Scott Bell and Jerry Jenkins have given the nod to her, and voices as familiar as Rebecca St. James gives her seal of approval as well! That's incredible, and I give my humble applause as well. We join the likes of Christy Williams, a gal with some weight on her shoulders that only a bottle and pack of Winston cigarettes seem to cure. At least on a temporary basis, that is. And when trouble comes calling, abusive Vince seems to be in the shadows of it all. And working for a used bookstore, she's just trying to do her best and convince people she can do a thing or two. And all of a sudden, Christy is caught between a rock and a hard place, and desperate measures might have to be taken. In the midst of all this, a few hours away, Christy's sister, May, works on a ranch. She wonders what has happened to her long lost sister. Until she shows up on her doorstep. And showing her Aunt Edna's love and compassion, she hopes to mend a few things, and that things might come to light. Well, the bell just may toll in this case. But then again, there are some nasty things that lurk about. The one thing I kept thinking of was how Darlington compares with the guts of W. Dale Cramer. And I just couldn't help but think of how much fun I was really having after turning that first page! C.J. Darlington is no boring author, and she'll let you know when the bullet hits the bone, let me tell you! Some authors ease off when it gets a little too heavy. Not this one! And I'm glad I tracked this baby down. She has been added to a list of authors I can't wait to read. I hope she knows that. Thank you, C.J., you are awesome!!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Thicker Than Blood ended up being much darker than I anticipated! It's definitely not my normal type of read. I think it's important to know that this is not a romance book. It is a beautiful story of forgiveness on many different levels. Christy was a bit different than most leading ladies in Christian Fiction I read. She's a chain smoker and an alcoholic. I don't drink or smoke, so I didn't exactly connect with her. I did have sympathy for her and liked her well enough, though. Towards the end of the book, something is revealed that disturbed me so bad I had to walk away from the story a bit. There are parts of the story that are hard to read! It's definitely not light and fluffy. The bad guy of this story was the meanest I've ever read about. As I mentioned ealier, this isn't my normal type of read, though. I found the antique books part of the story absolutely fascinating! I just adore old, antique books! I could spend days in any type of bookstore, but especially an antique bookstore. C.J. really brought Dawson's Book Barn to life in my mind. I could smell the books! I really enjoyed most(minus the hard parts ;) ) of this story and I can't wait to read Bound By Guilt!", "id": "17"}

{"review": "Lady Charlisse leaves London and the only life she's ever known in search of the father's love she has never possessed. Raised and abused by a licentious uncle, Charlisse bears deep physical and emotional scars that leave her wary of trusting men and the God her uncle claimed to serve. En route to Port Royal, the ship she bartered passage on sinks in a violent storm and Charlisse is left shipwrecked and struggling for survival on a deserted island. Near death, she is discovered by a band of pirates led by the infuriating and enigmatic Captain Edmund Merrick. Edmund Merrick is a man with a mission. Once a pirate, Edmund has become a Christian and a privateer in the service of King Charles. He seeks to serve his new Lord by ridding the Caribbean of pirates and is on a quest to stop the reign of terror led by his one-time captain, Edward the Terror. When he rescues Charlisse from near-starvation, Edmund finds himself inexplicably attracted to her and admires her strength and tenacity. However, Charlisse brings new dilemmas to his life - not only must he protect her from his lecherous crew, but his resolve to capture Edward is shaken when he discovers his nemesis is none other than Charlisse's long sought-for father. Charlisse struggles to trust Edmund and his God -- never having known the love of a father, with only an abusive uncle as a male role model, her adventures in the Caribbean become an extreme exercise in faith. When treachery threatens to separate Charlisse and Edmund forever, and Charlisse's life is subsequently threatened by her father and his pirates, will their fledgling faith be enough to see them through seemingly overwhelming obstacles? With a release timed to coincide with the \"pirates craze\" surrounding POTC: Dead Man's Chest, Tyndall's novel perfectly fills a gap in the CBA historical fiction market. On one level, simply put the novel is a great deal of sheer fun to read. The Redemption reminded me of Linda Chaikin's great pirate novels released about ten years ago, and delivers action, romance, and exotic locales in spades. Tyndall draws her characters with a great deal of style and panache and the fact that this is her debut novel, is, quite frankly, astounding. Her prose sparkles, the action is tightly plotted, and she incorporates faith without ever resorting to trite clichés or heavy-handed treatment. Highly recommended. Tyndall is an author that I look forward to seeing more from. Thankfully, one will not have to wait long for a sequel. Book #2 in the Legacy of the King's Pirates series, The Reliance, releases in January 2007 followed by book #3, The Restitution, in June (well-timed to coincide with the release of the final Pirates of the Caribbean film, I might add!).", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "My favorite character in this book is Captain Merrick, but I did like Charlisse a lot. Merrick and Charlisse meet on an island, she half starved, and he surrounded by his pirate crew. The only option he can find is to bring her with him on his pirate ship. Merrick isn't an average pirate, though he's actually a privateer, he's a faithful man of God who has chosen to track down bad men and turn them over to the law. Charlisse is searching for the father she's never met, if only to escape her abusive uncle. This book had many twists and turns I didn't expect. For an author's first book, it's amazing! My favorite series is the Legacy of the King's Pirates! When I was in fifth grade I stayed at my aunt's house one day and I wouldn't shut up so she gave me this book to read. I didn't know a few of the words so I put it down. I put it in a box. A few years later we moved and I found the book again. I started reading it and I couldn't stop. The Redemption became my favorite book, and MaryLu Tyndall became my favorite author! After I read this book I started reading my Bible and found Jesus again. Also, on October 20, 2010 I was baptized! The road I'm on all started with reading this book. God chose MaryLu Tyndall as His instrument to lead me back to Him.

{"review": "A Christian Pirate novel, what a concept, what an oxymoron! M.L. Tyndall, author of The Redemption, is quick to point out that the genre is actually historical romance--with plenty of gritty swashbuckling. So what am I, an industrialized-blue-collar-yankee-Christian reader and writer of adventures, doing reading what Barbour categorizes as fiction/ general/ romance? It is with pleasure and complete surprise that I found myself completely engrossed in The Redemption from start to finish. The Redemption is no more or less a romance novel than is Robin Hood. Anyone interested in classic swashbuckling action stories which just happen to include a leading lady and man reluctantly falling in love, must read this book, regardless of the bookstore shelf label. Not only was I relieved to discover The Redemption to be all Robin Hood with a thimble of Maid Marion, I was ecstatic to find that the quality of M.L. Tyndall's writing rivals that of Robin Hood author, James Clarke Holt! Every scene that could have lapsed into page-flipping predictability instead edged me on my seat then riveted me there with clashing cutlasses, strategic naval maneuvers and dire conflict: I'd found a gold and pearl true pirate treasure. Those are pumped-up-classy review terms but remember I'm a writer. This is what makes The Redemption true literature . . . We begin with a shipwreck introduction of the heroine: must be the Godly woman who leads all the pirates to Jesus, right? Wrong. Lady Charlisse Bristol is a non-Christian who hates the church. She's rescued off a desert island when a pirate ship stops for careening and fresh water. The Redemption (the pirate ship) is captained by a Christian--yes, my eyebrows did the same thing. While this story is not easily labeled, The Redemption can be best categorized as alternate-history, a sub-genre of speculative fiction. One of the reasons I'm drawn to write spec-fic is the creative latitude granted by the genre: If you can make something like a Christian pirate believable to your reader, it's allowed. Not only does M.L. Tyndall make apparent contradictions believable, she makes them logical and does so with the most powerful tool of fiction--deep characterization: \"Captain Edmund Merrick was raised in Britian's high society, found snobbery unfulfilling and fled to the Caribbean to seek adventure. Years of piracy proved equally unfulfilling and eventually he found Christ. The only reason Merrick's still in the pirate-game is that he was contracted by England to raid the Spanish Main.\" In classic style and voice, Tyndall skillfully braids breathing characters with Raider's of the Lost Ark non-stop plot conflict and action, forcing you to turn pages until the very end.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "MaryLu Tyndall is one of the finest writers in Christian fiction and \"The Redemption\" is just another testament to that fact. Her descriptions will leave you breathless as she brings her unforgettable characters and their exotic surroundings to life with a vivid clarity that is uniquely her own. Lady Charlisse Bristol is a young, innocent, beauty that has faced a lot of pain in her life and seems destined to face more. The death of her mother has left her at the mercy of her tyrannical uncle and his perverted, sadistic ways. With no other choice and the fear of what he may do next, Charlisse flees her opulent dungeon and secures passage on a merchant ship destined for Port Royal to find her father, a man she's never even met but who she believes is waiting for her and will love and protect her. But a terrible storm overtakes the ship, throwing our heroine into the turbulent, unforgiving waves. By the grace of a God she doesn't feel cares for an unclean, unworthy, nobody like herself, she has washed ashore on a deserted island. Lost and alone, hurt and hungry, she believes her survival of the sea was only to die a far worse death on this uninhabited land, a death she has been brainwashed into believing she deserves. As days turn into weeks, she begins to lose all hope of ever getting off this wretched island and ever meeting her father who is possibly the only person left on earth that will love her. She's hesitantly prayed for rescue, yet she never dreamed it would come in the form of a pirate. Captain Edmund Merrick is a pirate, yet not the kind you'd expect. At one time bloodshed and power and greed fueled him, making a name for himself that was to be revered and feared. But he has since become a Christian and has given up most all his pirate ways. He has been commissioned by England to take and apprehend the ships and good, whether by land or by sea, of the King of Spain. So he's a legal sort of pirate now. He is still fierce, no question about it, but he is a good and fair captain, honorable and trustworthy, yet, easily given to cad tendencies that seem to be ingrained within him. His devastating good looks hit a girl like a rogue wave, stealing her breath and leaving her at his mercy. Our Charlisse isn't immune, and who could blame her? Having just spoiled a Spanish merchant vessel, Captain Merrick is heading to a safe and secluded island to careen his ship. He has no idea the beautiful treasure awaiting him on those shores but soon finds that this treasure is a massive weight of responsibility and protecting her from his unruly, unscrupulous crew, and even from himself, is going to take all the strength he can muster. He has never been drawn to a woman the way he is to Charlisse and he seems to have awakened feelings in her heart as well, which could be a problem, for it is a long way to port where he can deposit her safely to her father. But to Merrick's horror, he learns that the father she has risked so much to find, the father she believes will protect her from her evil uncle, the father she believe will love her, just so happens to be Edward the Terror, the wickedest, most ruthless pirate in the Caribbean, who Merrick has sworn to bring to justice. How can Merrick convince her that this man is not the father she envisioned him to be and that finding him could put her in the greatest danger of all? Her girlish heart simply can't believe that the man who her mother loved and who loved her in return could be this monster Merrick warns of. Surely he wouldn't hurt his own daughter. Can Merrick protect her before it's too late? And what of his mutinous first mate, Kent, who challenges his every decision and wants all that is his, including Charlisse? Much and many stand in the way of Merrick and Charlisse's love. Grave dangers and powers both seen and unseen threaten to destroy them from every side. Will they and their love survive to sail into the sunset for a happily ever after? I have to warn you, the romance was a little on the heavy, edgy side for me and the single deciding factor in why I can't give this book the 5 stars that I desperately want to. I loved our hero, Merrick, but I didn't quite understand why, especially as a Christian, every look he sent Charlisse was seductive or sensual or a bold perusal from her head to her toes with undisguised lust and longing. I know he is a young Christian who is surrounded by a band of depraved pirates, having once been counted among the fiercest, most depraved himself, but his less than gentlemanly actions made me uncomfortable. Charlisse knows nothing of men and I felt that there were moments when Merrick clearly took advantage of her innocence. Granted he eases off significantly when he learns of the horrors she suffered in her past and is now determined to protect her from anyone that could hurt her, including himself. He also protected her from his crew, ready to defend her honor without the slightest hesitation. He has more morals and conviction then the whole lot of them combined but the first half of the book left me wondering how much of a change took place in his life since accepting Christ into his heart. To his credit, though, we see a significant change in him in the second half of the book both in his manner toward Charlisse and in his own heart of hearts. I know Christians are a work in progress as we run our race and Tyndall certainly knows how to paint our victories and our failures. So, I think the title of this book is quite fitting for what takes place therein. **QUICK, POSSIBLE SPOILER** It appears every man on the ship and on land lusts after Charlisse, including men in her own family. There are quite a few \"almost\" rape scenes and shared memories of her past that will make your skin crawl. I suppose they do have a place in the story but that doesn't make them any easier to read. So, especially if you're a teen or are thinking of giving this to a teen reader, please proceed with caution. **END of POSSIBLE SPOLIER** All edginess aside, this book was possibly the best I've read from the pen of MaryLu Tyndall and showcased some powerfully redemptive moments. Charlisse must come to the Lord and open her heart to Him, for only He can bring peace and restore a broken life. And while Merrick has accepted Christ, he needs to release all control to Him, for nothing short of a completely surrendered life will do. The Lord requires much from our hero and heroine, and each trial they face is a lesson in humility, patience, trust, and hope, testing their faith and refining their hearts. Tyndall always scripts incredible conversion scenes - scenes that move you to tears, scenes that you wish you could claim as your own personal testimony, scenes that let you know you serve a great and mighty God who can do all things if we just believe and have faith that He can. I greatly look forward to reading the next two books in The Legacy of the King's Pirates series!", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "Once again I have spent good money on a book with a 5-star rating, only to discover it is mediocre at best. Was this book supposed to be for young adults? I don't see a young adult designation on it anywhere, but it reminds me of something I might have enjoyed in the eighth grade. As an adult, I expect a little more out of my reading material. Lady Charlisse Bristol goes from one predictably dire peril to another. Abused by an evil (but not very imaginative) uncle, she travels across the sea to find her father, who is also evil, in a standard pirate sort of way. Along the way she survives a shipwreck, falls in love, is captured by pirates (twice), witnesses various ship battles and sword fights, is starved and beaten, and, most important, maintains her virginity until marriage. The characters are shallow and predictable. The hero is somewhat swashbuckling, but having recently been \"saved\", he tries not to kill anybody or consort with loose women. He's not very believable. The heroine is feisty -- that annoying kind of feisty where you wish she would just shut up and think about her situation a little before she spouts off with another insult. The religious images are more disturbing than comforting. Birds and animals as familiars is more of a wicca magick than a Christian tradition. Even more disturbing was the little tricks God plays. Every time Charlisse prays, she gets another little miracle from God. How about a ring of laser lights to keep the rats away? Isn't that special? Nothing restores one's faith like God answering prayers with His special Godly powers. And I really hated the deathbed redemption. A vicious, murdering, raping, pirate sees Jesus at the last minute and says \"I repent\" with his last breath, and that's it. All is forgiven. Hooray for Christianity. Obviously there are people who think this book is wonderful. It is full of messages of faith, and has plenty of action to keep the story moving. But it is not great literature. It's not even a great romance. It's just an insipid little story with a proselytizing undertone. I wish I had known that before I spent my money.", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "Swashbuckling pirates, battles at sea, a lady in distress, and a missing father all combine in The Redemption by M. L. Tyndall for an enjoyable read. The first surprise came when I realized that the pirate captain, Edmund Merrick, had already become a Christian. How could this be? How could he continue his \"occupation\" as a pirate and profess to be a Christian? The questions drove me to read as quickly as I could. Finally it dawned on me. Edmund was a British subject in 1665 working at the Queen's order. He was a \"legal\" pirate. He and his pirate crew hunt down Spanish ships for the Queen. The British were at odds with the Spanish during this time period. The problem with not with Ms. Tyndall's writing; it was with my lack of quick knowledge of the history of the time period. I must say that in spite of my confusion I had to keep reading. Edmund Merrick's character enticed me to keep going to see how he would deal with the conflicts he experienced between the requirements of his job and his need to follow a more Christian path. Would he change or revert to his pre-Christian ways? In Lady Charlisse Bristol, M. L. Tyndall created a strong heroine. Her determination to live after the shipwreck that stranded her alone on a deserted island and to find her missing father made me want to cheer her on. As Charlisse struggles to get through all the trials, I wondered how much more could she endure? I've watched a lot of movies about pirates and enjoyed them, but I've not done a lot of reading from this time period. The weaving of the threads of historical facts is so well done in this novel that the unfamiliar nature of them became a rich background instead of a jarring intrusion. The romance M. L. Tyndall creates in The Redemption drew me into the story as well. Would Edmund and Charlisse find a way to cross the ocean of doubt and fear between them in order to be able to acknowledge their attraction for one another? Women readers will find this story captivating, yet it is written with a strong enough hero to attract male readers as well.", "id": "12290"}

I had a hint of who was behind the main crime about midway through, but I was never completely certain until the end. It was fascinating to see how the different cases related. The romance aspect wasn't as surprising, and there were a couple of times that I was confused by their wishy-washy feelings.

{"review": "Taylor Martin is a Psychology professor and criminal profiler. She is very good at what she does, but is frustrated. The crime she most wants to solve is the disappearance of her own father years ago. Despite the fact that police --- and several family members --- are convinced there was no foul play involved, and he just up and left his wife and children behind, Taylor refuses to believe it. Reoccurring dreams she’s been having of clowns seem to play a part in the mystery, and she is itching to find proof that her suspicions are valid. When her brother calls asking her to come home to Logan Point, Mississippi, to prevent their uncle from selling their family’s land, Taylor balks, not wanting to get involved. But the quest for facts about her father’s disappearance, along with being threatened by an unknown stalker, is enough to prompt her to hop a plane. If nothing else, she will be able to search for answers she’s been seeking. Nick Sinclair is a bestselling novelist who has been carrying grief and guilt ever since he lost his wife to a senseless crime he feels he could have prevented. When his brother Scott, an alcoholic with a troubled history, is accused of possibly stalking a beautiful college professor, Scott is determined to clear the name of the only relative he has left. This includes convincing Taylor of his brother’s innocence, which is not as easy as he hoped, especially because he finds himself falling for the gorgeous brunette. Once home, Taylor must confront her past as she digs for the truth about her dad, while also trying to solve the case of her mystery stalker. Nick seems confident that his brother is being set up, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary. The one thing Taylor knows for sure is that the last thing she needs right now is a man to distract her. Even if he is drop-dead handsome. SHADOWS OF THE PAST is a dynamic debut novel by Patricia Bradley. The story is fast-paced, with lots of tension --- both physically and romantically. Nick’s brother as a suspect in Taylor’s stalking case, along with their personal reasons for not getting involved with a member of the opposite sex, creates powerful conflict. But, refreshingly, this story doesn’t contain the numerous pull-back/move forward exchanges present in many romance novels. Rather, aside from a few moments of emotional retraction, as well as the expected outrage over a “betrayal” of sorts at the end, Taylor and Nick’s relationship continues to slowly build throughout, resulting in a satisfying conclusion. From Taylor’s mother, to best friend and police officer Olivia (Livy) Reynolds, to Scott Sinclair and his attorney, secondary characters are well-crafted, with believable actions and motivations. None seem out of place, each holding his or her own piece of the storyline without overshadowing another. Especially enjoyable is Taylor’s relationship with best friend Livy. Their friendship comes across as honest and tender, yet with several light sarcastic barbs that keep things fun and entertaining. As for the mystery surrounding Taylor’s father, Bradley expertly weaves the required twists and turns, keeping readers guessing until the very end. The climactic page-turning conclusion is not full of thrills and chills, but is very well executed. Patricia Bradley is a welcome addition to the Christian fiction market, earning a well-deserved spot on bookstore shelves. This first novel will surely please avid romantic suspense fans, and readers will find her writing to be similar in style to seasoned authors like Lynette Eason, Dee Henderson and Dani Pettrey. SHADOWS OF THE PAST is the first in the Logan Point series, with book two, PROMISE TO PROTECT, due out this fall. Reviewed by Lynda Lee Schab", "id": "17"}

{"review": "I read Persepolis tonight. I mean the whole thing. I started it after dinner, and just finished it at the 153rd page. For those of you who've read, or should I say \"experienced\" this work, that won't come as a surprise. For those of you who haven't, consider it a high-endorsement. I had other plans for my night... ..I also had my doubts about this work. Despite the rave reviews, I've never even read a comic book. That, coupled with the fact that at first glance, it seemed very...well, childish? Oh the shame! Marjane Satrapi has created an apologetic convert out of me. Persepolis is the story of one girls experience during the fall of the Shah of Iran, the ensuing Islamic Revolution (which included Stalin like \"purges\"), and war with Iraq. Only it's not told in plain text, but rather is a pictured in a comic book style. A history buff myself, I have an above-average awareness of the historical goings on of that period. However, told in this unorthodox style, with pictures, through the creative and emotional eyes of a child, the \"facts\" gained a vibrance and color for me like never before. The human side of history had so much more meaning, and seemed to imprint a deeper and easier understanding in my mind than most accounts. When I was thinking about what was so compelling about this book, I thought of Edward Tufte. He's a famous professor and scientist in the field of displaying information graphically. I went to a seminar by him once. He passionately explained the concept of neural bandwidth, and how most text and plain graphs don't take advantage of the massive processing power of our minds. The pictures in Persepolis, coupled with Marjane's rich historical account seemed to take advantage of that latent neural ability. For me, they compounded and achieved something of an emotional critical mass of understanding that few books have. So, like I said, I'm a convert. I just ordered her second work \"The Story of a Return\". Only this time, I'll have a nice bottle of wine, and no plans for the night. Enjoy, Christian Hunter Santa Barbara, California", "id": "2"}
{"review": "PERSEPOLIS is a graphical autobiography of the author, who experienced the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war as a child in the 1970s and 1980s. It is told in the beatiful black and white graphical language of a comic strip where simple pictures communicate strong feelings, much better than words could. But PERSEPOLIS is also the story or a whole generation of young Iranians, who left their land in the quest of better conditions during the post-revolutionary era. I belong to this generation myself and I totally identified with the experiences Ms SATRAPI went through- her childhood in post revolutionary Iran, her description of Iranian society at the time, her exile in Austria- also in the volumes 2 & 3 (which already appeared in French). Though conceived as a comic book, the book has messages which are not childish in nature: the child, through the naiveness of her views, points out to many of the contradictions of Iranian society that adults are unwilling to face. It is also one of the rare unbiased personal accounts of what happened in Iran at the time of ther evolution and as such, is an interesting document on this period of Iranian history. (It certainly contains more information on Iran and its people than the junk broadcasted on most TV channels). Some readers (including reviews posted here) criticize this book for not being a realistic description of Iran. Though I totally disagree with this criticism, the main point is that PERSEPOLIS is NOT a history book nor a sociological study. It is a story, the story of a childhood and the author has never claimed it to be otherwise. I definitely recommend this book, first to all Iranians who live abroad, especially those who did not grow up in Iran and did not experience the revolution, and then to all readers interested in getting a human, insider view of what Iranian society was like in the early 1980s.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "At last this gem reaches us in America, after raking in awards all over Europe. Not only is it a very timely and revealing peek inside daily life in Iran, it's also a very personal, sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking slice of one remarkable girl's life. There really is nothing quite like it, it's true. I've given copies of it to all my friends, many of whom never read graphic novels or comic books, but they all agree: this is something special. It's not suitable for kids though, because of its depiction of torture and violence and other mature themes you might expect in a society under the yoke of fundamentalist islamic rule. But for everyone else, I highly recommend PERSEPOLIS. This is an exceptional childhood memoir, that ranks with Angela's Ashes for its depth and authenticity. This one will be around forever.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "In \"Persepolis,\" Marjane Satrapi writes a fascinating and moving memoir of her childhood in Iran, a country torn by uprisings, war, and political and cultural upheaval. She has written this graphic autobiography as a testament to her beloved Iran and as a remembrance of those who have suffered, lost their lives, or fled their homeland due to war and oppression. She says that \"One can forgive but one should never forget.\" The story opens at Satrapi's birth under the Shah's regime, and follows her life through Iran's revolution, conversion to an Islamic regime, and war with Iraq. A precocious single child of progressive activist parents, she is a witness to the complications and contradictions of Iranian daily life, both private and public. She recalls the first day the girls are forced to wear the veil at school. Through a child's innocent eyes, she describes her fears of the imprisonment, torture, and execution of friends, family, and neighbors, as well as of the bombings, oppression, and harassment that have become part of the fabric of her life. In spite of the turmoil, the author is a typical adolescent who takes risks by obtaining forbidden rock star posters, attending parties, wearing jewelry and jeans, and arguing politics with her teachers. Above all else, she is a spunky and lovable child who looks for freedom wherever she can obtain it and manages to triumph over her restrictive surroundings. The illustrations provide a simple but powerful depiction of the events in the author's life. Many of the drawings have a dream-like quality that accentuates the emotional impact of the joys, sadness, violence, and familial love that Satrapi experiences. This touching story reminds me of Hosseini's \"The Kite Runner.\" I recommend both as excellent coming-of-age stories in tumultuous foreign settings. Eileen Rieback", "id": "2"}

Ms. Satrapi finds the common thread of everyone's childhood (her recollection of wanting to grow up to be a prophet is hilarious) but also expresses her unique voice and identity as the daughter of liberal Iranians whose views ended up being thwarted by the new regime that was ushered in following the 1979 revolution.

{"review": "In Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi uses the graphic novel format to share her life story with readers. Satrapi grew up in Iran during the years that the Shah lost power and the Fundamentalist Muslims became the government authority. Satrapi was raised in a modern family that valued education and modern life. Her parents were part of the revolution that forced the Shah from power. They were shocked, however, when the ultra-religous government that took over soon made the freedoms they were used to and expected illegal. No longer could women dress as they pleased; they were instead forced to wear the veil. No longer could the Iranian people travel freely; the borders were closed for over three years, and even when reopened, passports were almost impossible to obtain. No longer could one count on an education; the universities were closed for over two years. Darker items were to follow. There were 3000 political prisoners under the Shah, but there were 300,000 political prisoners under the new regime. Satrapi's family had both relatives and friends that were imprisoned, tortured and some were even executed. Then the government got involved in a war with Iraqi. Bombings were common, and over a million people were killed. Satrapi's use of the graphic format is a perfect match to the story of a young girl whose life changes so dramatically and who tries to make sense of the things happening around her with a child's understanding. Satrapi ended up being educated outside of Iran in her teen years and later, and chose a graphic artist's career. This book was a perfect match for her talent, and her memoir is chilling. To see freedoms taken away gradually is difficult, and when one looks up and sees where the normality markers have moved to, it is eye-opening. This book is recommended to all readers who care about world events, and those who enjoy memoirs.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Being an American woman roughly Marjane's age, I grew up knowing nearly nothing of the conflict in the Middle East, certainly not understanding it.

It is extremely well-told and illustrated. I read the book in one setting and anxiously await the next two volumes to be translated into English. For any fan of graphic novels, I highly recommend this one.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis (Pantheon, 2003) Persepolis is that rarest of birds, a graphic novel that has transcended the idea of the graphic novel and gained a strong foothold in the world of mainstream literature; not since Maus has a book with so much of its content devoted to illustration gotten such a huge following among those who'd never otherwise consider looking at a \"comic book.\" Tack on any hopes that spring immediately to mind here; you're likely to have them dashed, just like we did with Maus. But still, maybe a handful will go on to discover David B. or Kyle Baker or Neil Gaiman's graphic work, and it will all have meant something. Persepolis is the first piece of Marjane Satrapi's autobiography, and it deals with her childhood and youth first in the Shah's regime, then after the overthrow by Ayatollah Khomeini (though, oddly, Khomeini is never mentioned by name once in the book; I hesitate to offer, while hoping it's true, that perhaps Satrapi keeps him unnamed as a show of disdain). Her stated goal is to show the world that many Muslims living under oppressive regimes are not tower-bombing fanatics, a stance that does raise more questions than it answers (most importantly, why share a religion with such nutcases?, a question that should not, of course, be limited only to those who follow Islam). That aside, Satrapi does achieve her goal quite handily, and it may well be an eye-opener for those who did not previously realize that not everyone in Iran is, in fact, a dangerous zealot. The artwork, not surprisingly, has that sort of L'Association feel about it that was also present in David B's award-winning Epileptic; everyone seems a bit rounder than one normally finds in comics, without many angles at all, seeming somewhat vague and unformed. The dialogue is subtly geared towards what a child/youth would hear, while the infrequent narration is imparted in an adult tone, giving the book a nice added touch of veracity. A very good start to the series. *** ½", "id": "2"}
{"review": "PERSEPOLIS is what has come to be known as a \"graphic novel.\" In its purist form, a graphic novel is a story told through sequential art. A friend of mine, upon receiving a copy of THE ROAD TO PERDITION that I sent to him, called me and exclaimed in delight, \"I didn't know they had these things! It's like a comic book!\" And yes, it is. When it's well done, it's not as easy as it looks and not simply something for lazy readers. You must have an excellent writer, a sensitive illustrator, and empathy between them to make it work. Marjane Satrapi demonstrates her writing and artistic skills in PERSEPOLIS, which tells the story of Satrapi's early childhood, with the main focus being on her life from age ten through fourteen, from 1980 through 1984. Those were particularly turbulent years for Satrapi's native country of Iran, encompassing the overthrow of Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (the Shah of Iran), the installation of the Islamic Republic, and the war with Iraq. The story is told entirely through the eyes of Satrapi, the child, and how these events affected her parents, her relatives, her friends, and herself. In her introduction to PERSEPOLIS, Satrapi notes that writing this book was so important to her since her native country is associated with fundamentalism, fanaticism and terrorism; she does not want the entire nation judged, in her words, upon the actions of a few extremists. She additionally does not want the victims of these actions to be forgotten. In this, she succeeds: Satrapi's stark black and white images cast an appropriate and memorable gloom over her story. PERSEPOLIS has been compared to MAUS, and certainly Satrapi's topic is somewhat similar, but her artistic style is closer to that of Los Bros Hernandez, whose brilliant LOVE AND ROCKETS is sadly missed. While Satrapi's artistic technique tends toward the spare, she wrings every possible emotion out of each drawing, communicating with a few strokes and shades what might otherwise take paragraphs, or even pages of words. When, for instance, she learns of the execution of her favorite uncle at the hands of the Islamic Republic, her reaction, her emotional devastation, is communicated ever so eloquently in a single, stark panel. It is almost anti-climactic when she rejects the personification of God afterward. Even the images of playtime and recreation --- those things that we here in the United States take for granted --- are subtlety infused with somber overtones. PERSEPOLIS ends with Satrapi's parents sending her to Austria to avoid the repercussions of the Islamic government. One is left wondering what became of Satrapi and her parents. Satrapi is reportedly working on a sequel to PERSEPOLIS, which undoubtedly will be most welcomed by readers of this volume. --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub", "id": "2"}

{"review": "I got the book this morning, and as I was hobbled by pain from an ACL surgery and unable to take painkillers because they would make me loopy at work, instead I read this all day. (Shhhhh. It is okay. I also helped customers.) There are a million things I love about this book, but I can start with the fact that each chapter is printed on different-colored pages than the ones on either side of it, which makes the book look like a rainbow when it is closed. A RAINBOW, GUYS. The Depression chapters (previously published on her blog) are revelations to those who have experienced depression and touchstones of understanding for those who have not. The Dog chapters are hilarious to both dog-lovers and cat-lovers (AKA dog haters). The chapters that peek into her childhood make me wish I remembered anything about my life before I was twelve. But you know what? I'm going to take a page from this book, and just imagine that my childhood was just as fantastical, wild, revelatory, unintentionally hilarious, and unique. Yes, there are a few chapters that are repeats from the blog. Sadly, the fish incident did not make it... that one is still my favorite. But the ones that did make it are definitely worth the re-read. Also, the majority of the book is new material, including some introspective chapters (\"Thoughts and Feelings\" and the two-part \"Identity\" chapters). Those, to me, were the best ones of the whole book. I love that the author is so freaking honest (can you swear on Amazon? Imma go with no) about EVERYTHING. She holds this mirror up to her guiding principles and then picks everything apart until she's left with this uncivilized and selfish husk, which she then covers up in a sparkly jumpsuit to make it all better. WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ALL DO. We're all basically uncivilized and selfish. But this author has the guts to admit it. YOU ARE BRAVE, ALLIE. YOU ARE. I feel strangely proud of the author for producing this book. Proud like a father, even though she is no relation to me and I have never really met her. I want to give her all the gold stars possible. If there were more than five available for this review, I would have gone with more than five. All the way up to eleventy. Buy this book. Read it. Go read the blog. Re-read everything. Then buy the book for your friends.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "I've been a fan of Allie Brosh's (Allie? Can I call her Allie? Is that weird?) blog for years now, so I was never not buying her book. Her blog is less a series of wordy posts about what happened that day and more comic strip about fish murders, spiders, spaghatta nadles, and the single strangest childhood since Drew Barrymore's. Her book? It's an offline edition of her blog. So in other words, it's just about perfect. Some new...chapters? Posts? What do you even call these? Anyway, parts of the book are new, others are from the blog, all put together in something approaching a coherent narrative. I'm not terribly upset about blog posts being included in the book. It wouldn't make sense without some of them, and some others are just so good and so well-known that to leave them out would make the book incomplete. It's much bigger than I had expected, containing a good eighteen chapterposts from 10 to 50 pages long each, but that doesn't matter because you'll read the whole thing in one sitting if you're not a communist. The first chapter alone has swearing at a two-year-old, time travel, and nudity of the most gratuitous sort. In that order. The thing about this book (and Allie's blog) is...beyond the laughs, she's actually really good. Her two posts on what depression is like (both included here) are the best explanations I've ever seen. And what look initially like simple stick figure drawings are actually surprisingly detailed illustrations that convey a full range of emotion. The art is good, the stories are fantastic, and her telling of them is what makes it all work. Most importantly of all, the cover is a pleasing shade of yellow. Buy a copy for yourself. Buy one for the office, one for the house, one to keep in the gentleman's closet, one for your neighbors, one for everyone you know for Christmas. You'll like it, they'll like it, it'll class up both your workplace and your toilet.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "Allie Brosh's pinpointed humor, childish yet not-quite-childish anecdotes, and incredibly self-realized life stories at her cherished blog, Hyperbole and a Half, are what made her an internet icon. You either have never heard of her, or worship the ground upon she walks. There is no in-between. For the first time, her illustrated memoir essays are bound, and this print volume features not only eight of her most popular and most affecting blog entries, but also ten brand-new original pieces that will remind you of why you fell in love with her blog in the first place—or if you're unfamiliar with it, just how much you've been missing out. Hyperbole and a Half is so well known for its bizarrely hilarious cartoons; as exemplified in the infamous \"CLEAN ALL THE THINGS!\" meme, her essays are accompanied by intentionally rudimentary Paint (et al.) illustrations that bring her personality and wit to life. Some daft early readers commented \"I could draw way better than you!\" on her posts, and well, that's the point. (Those readers didn't last very long). Brosh's short memoirs are so special because they are highly conscientious, highly exaggerated (hence the hyperbole part), and perfectly capture the essence of identity and self-acceptance. I find it magical how she manages to be sentimental without being corny, intellectual without being standoffish, and comical without being snarky. She covers nostalgic topics like the mishaps of childhood, edgy topics like chronic depression, and downright entertaining topics like the weird and lovable beasts that are dogs. I swear to you: THERE ARE SO MANY DOGS IN THIS BOOK. If you have dogs, this is a must-read for a good laugh. If you have ever struggled with depression or self-doubt, this is a must-read for harsher realities and a sliver ever-burning hope. If you had a childhood, this is a must-read because—don't even lie to me: everyone was a child once. This book—and blog!—is simply a must-read, no excuses. Pros: Some of my favorite essays from the blog selected // New content is fresh and original; did not disappoint // Dorky, strange, hilarious // Spunky and kooky; makes you want to be Allie's BFF // Appropriate for all ages // Still manages to be deeply meaningful and substantial Cons: Not enough stories! I want MORE Verdict: This blog-inspired collection of full-color-illustrated memoirs—ranging from lifetime reflections to random observant wisps of humor—is guaranteed to fill you with nostalgia, cripple you with laughter, and become your next internet obsession. An adult graphic novel that would just as easily please preteens, Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened is entertaining, wacky, and at times, even somber—and this attitude of not taking things too seriously, yet still being sincere, makes it that much more of an extraordinary experience. Brosh's intelligent but self-deprecating humor will charm you and disarm you. This is a book to be read over and over again. Rating: 10 out of 10 hearts (5 stars): I'm speechless; this book is an extraordinarily amazingly wonderfully fantastically marvelous masterpiece. Drop everything and go buy yourself a copy now!

{"review": "I just got this book this morning via kindle. I thought I'd take a quick peek via the website at what I bought (holding off on immediately opening things I bought, recieved or otherwise obtained is NOT one of my strong points. I would make a very shitty postman). Of course, a few hours later, here I am at work, having done nothing of the list of things that have been overdue since last week, and still very happy I spent my morning this way. There's a fair few bits of the blog coming back (although it's mostly the ones I was happy to re-read due to either being so brainnumbingly good I just delighted in them, or one of the few bits I haven't re-read a million times already), but a substantial part of the book is entirely new stuff. And the new stuff is GOOOOOD. If you, like any reasonable person (and quite a few certifiable people) loved her insights on depression and the problems arising when little boys and/or girls get mistaken for grown-ups just because they've been around on this earth for a few decades, you'll love her new stuff. Her ruthless disection of the many ways in which her ideal of herself is not anywhere near the person she is, is something we can all relate to. And if you don't struggle for breath from laughter at the dog Q&A, I don't know what to tell you, except that you might be even more horrible of a person than Allie is. So, to finish off: one question for the author. From my stupid cat. Q: Srsly, why never bees?", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "The majority of negative reviews seem to come from these camps: 1. There's not enough all-new, previously unpublished content 2. The new content that is there isn't as funny as the original blog 3. I don't like the graphic novel-ish format and prefer reading online 4. The book contains too many F-bombs for my taste ... to which I counter: If you are already a fan of Allie's previous work, support her by buying her book. Regardless of the ratio of new vs republished work, by investing in the book, you can forever own a piece of Allie's work and hold it in your hands, and share it with others in the physical world in a more permanent and tangible way than pushing a button to just send them yet another link. Not to mention that it's the right thing to do. Invest a little coin to support a struggling artist who has been brave enough to bare her soul and gracious enough to previously share her work for free. By buying her book, you send the author a vote of confidence and tell her that her work has value. If you are not already familiar with Allie's work, read the \"Best of\" section of the Hyperbole and a Half blog first. Then understand that since that blog was written, the author has been openly struggling with debilitating depression and her new work comes from a much darker place. Given that, the raw language and journey into the abyss in her newer pieces may not be your cup of tea. And that's okay. Simply move along, then, nothing more to see here.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "The author is such a talent, and it was more sad than enjoyable to read story after story of her beating herself up for being a supposedly awful person. Her 'Depression Pt 1' and 'Depression Pt 2' were beautifully heartbreaking honest descriptions of suffering with depression. But her stories 'Motivation', 'Thoughts and Feelings', 'Identity Pt 1' and 'Identity Pt 2' felt less like fully realized stories and more like circular self-flagellation that left me shifting uncomfortably in my seat. The exuberance and joy that came along with such stories like 'The God of Cake' and 'The Party' were gone - these new stories were the stories of a human being in pain. I know that Allie is getting help, and I hope it will help her realize that she is certainly not as terrible as she seems to believe. I have trouble scoring my review because I don't think her book should be downmarked for writing about pain. I'd really give this a 3.5 if that were possible. But I do think that the stories above were pretty aimless, and the new ones that were full stories, like 'Lost in the Woods' were not as funny as some of the classics that had me rolling in laughter. However, some of the new stories were great, like 'The Helper Dog is an...' and really, anything to do with her dogs. I'm happy to support this author, and I hope that she will continue to make strides in her recovery from depression. I'm sure I would buy another book from her in the future.", "id": "4366"}

I would honestly be shocked if you do not come back here and buy her book after reading a few of her posts like \"Sneaky Hate Spiral\" and \"This is Why I'll Never Be an Adult\". Allie Brosh is smart, honest, and more often than not, hysterically funny. She honestly shares her childhood memories and has an incredible way of even recalling her childhood rationale. She writes in a way that makes you feel like she is your best friend regaling her tales of childhood and her extraordinarily, ordinary life events. This book is amazing! Allie included a few stories for her blog, but a lot of new stuff. She definitely makes up for not posting for a while. Thank you, Allie for writing a book!

She's always like a child looking at something for the first time. The results are hilarious and heartbreaking. Like an acrobat, pulling dangerous tricks with her mind, she goes to places we would be afraid to go, all for the sake of our entertainment.

{"review": "I know I’m not the only person in my age range that doesn’t much care for the stereotypes that go along with being a “millennial”. On one hand, we’ve adopted a guttersnake economy, we’re overmedicated, and we’re being told two converging messages: one of “leaving your campsite cleaner than when you found it” and the other of “a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do”. On the other hand, our inability to feed ourselves and our families on minimum wage has been construed as “lazy”, we’re often *under*medicated, and our one refuge of the internet is filled with some many converging ideas that it’s a wonder we leave our dirty apartments at all. To me, Allie Brosh has done a better job than just about anyone of expressing the fear, frustration, and just plain rampant silliness of being a millennial. This might sound overblown to those with only a passing understanding of her work (indeed–even bona fide fans might think I’m reading too much into this). Brosh’s “Hyperbole and a Half” collects several of the essays from her blog of the same name, and even tosses in some new ones. The stories are accented by Brosh’s child-like (yet completely compelling and hilarious) doodles. The essay topics vary greatly, from low self esteem to raising insane dogs to childhood to clinical depression. And that is where Brosh’s collection goes from insanely clever and charming picture book to millennial mini-manifesto (hereafter referred to as an “MMM”). In an age where “why can’t you just be happy?” is seen as a valid request of someone who has been discouraged to talk about his or her mental illness their entire life, Brosh makes the explanation of her own depression just that: an explanation. She makes everything clear–especially the aspects of it that make just as little sense to her as anyone else. And she does all of this while being charming, witty, and incredibly relatable. While these stories are certainly in the minority compared to the rest of the book, they leave the most lasting impression. Beyond these moments, however, Brosh is just plain laugh out loud funny. Her comics complement the stories perfectly, and never feel tacked on or superfluous. Her story of being attacked by a goose is a particularly terrific example of this, and she even includes stills from a video she made of the event, lest we think she was just making the entire event up. If I had anything to complain about, it’s merely that this book is so short. The entirety of it can be read in an afternoon, and it’s just so good that you can’t help but hop onto your computer and browse her blog for more goodness (which may have been her evil genius plan in the first place). Brevity aside–this is a fun book. I think that Ms. Brosh is a talented wit and an introspective young lady, and I really look forward to seeing what else she comes up with down the line.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "Like its predecessor this is a graphic-comic-chapter-book, and as such it works very well. But, this is the second Jedi Academy book. As the second volume it does not benefit from the novelty that helped sustain the first book, and it needs a plot and some narrative urgency to keep it from being just more of the same. My bottom line is that the book does a fine job of addressing middle school life and works some interesting variations on the standard school daze conventions, but remains of special interest mostly because of the Star Wars angle, (not that there's anything wrong with that). In Volume One Mr. Brown took practically every important aspect of the Star Wars canon, rewrote it in a style that would be interesting for and accessible to an early reader, illustrated it with very clever and apt illustrations, and wrapped it all up as a \"school days\" adventure that featured a realistic and engaging hero. In this book we move to a more advanced level - addressing the kinds of missteps a middle grader could make with his friends and classmates and also celebrating the kinds of adventures and victories a middle grader could encounter. The experience feels authentic rather than contrived and Roan remains a decent and engaging hero. (It seems worth noting that a running theme through the book is a cautionary tale about the misuse of holobook, (read facebook), as a bullying tool. This is an especially timely topic and fits nicely into the whole middle school experience.) But as before, the true genius here is the way that everything is based on Star Wars. There are lots of inside jokes and references, so that you have both an engaging story that is open to a Star Wars newbie and an immersive and sly Star Wars compendium for really rabid fans. The book is written at a chapter book or slightly higher level, but because it is a graphic novel with collages, inserts, extra illustrations, letters home, vacation photos and the like it feels a little bit more like a comic book. I could see this as being a really effective book for the purpose of moving a young reader from chapter books to more demanding fare. For what it's worth, Academy training includes a lot of emphasis on concentration, calm, courage, honesty, loyalty and similar virtues. While there is no particular political or moral point being made by the book it gives the story events a little bit of old fashioned positive instruction that I found welcome. The students are all decent and realistic, and the overall feel of the book is upbeat and positive. So, if your young reader is a Star Wars fan, or just looking for an early reader that's a bit out of the ordinary, this could be a very nice choice. Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book in exchange for a candid review. Apart from that I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "Jeffrey Brown's newest Jedi Academy book, Return of the Padawan, picks up where the previous one left off. Roan Novachez is about to begin his second year at the academy and is excited about seeing his friends and training to be a starfighter pilot. But things don't go exactly as planned, as Roan runs into girl trouble, friend trouble, bully trouble, and teacher trouble. Roan continues to learn about the Force, trains as a pilot, goes on field trips to other planets, and keeps drawing his comic strip, Ewok Pilot. Along the way, he learns what happens when you begin to venture down the path of the Dark Side and what it means to truly be a friend. Brown perfectly captures the essence of his characters, both with words and with pictures. With all the laughs, smiles, and awkwardness of the first book, Return of the Padawan shows the trials and tribulations of a middle school boy, although one who has the power of the Force. This book is a must read for young boys, or anyone who loves Star Wars and remembers what middle school was like.

{"review": "This is the sequel to Jedi Academy. If you read the first book, you are already in familiar territory. However, Jeffrey Brown up is game on this sequel. Besides putting a smile on my face, his book captured my attention to the point I couldn't put it down once I was by the middle of it. Who could have thought that you could have intrigue in middle school even in the Star War universe? In this book, Brown tells us what happen to Roan on his second year in the Jedi Academy. As in the first installment, this book is written in the fashion of a black and white comic book with interlaced pages from Roan's personal diary to give us an insight to Roan's mind and other notes such as letters and pages from the Padawan Observer to flesh out the Roan's world. This kind of story works because even as it happens in the Star Wars Universe, because Brown makes Roan's troubles in Jedi Academy relatable. I was half way this book, having my chuckles and smiles, thinking that this is the kind of book you can easily put down. Then a twist happened, one that I could see building up for a few pages. Just a few more pages, I thought. No easy resolution in sight, even worst, things got complicated. Ok, maybe a few more. This book was supposed to be just fun and relaxing read, but I was so vested on Roan that I have to know what was going to happen at the end. The good thing is that it is only 176 pages long, so I was able to finish it in a few hours. The bad thing is that it is only 176 pages long and I finished it in a few hours. So I could easily recommend this book for Star Wars fans and, frankly, for anyone who wants a chuckle with a good and simple story. On top of that, this is a book that you could easily pass to your little ones as they start to read. Another great introduction to comic books and Star Wars, with a great morale too.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "This is a cute little graphic novel clearly intended for young kids. You'll see it described this way a lot but it's true: this really is Diary of a Wimpy Kid in the Star Wars Universe. Although I hadn't read book 1, book 2 picks up the next year in Roan's life so I didn't feel like I had missed anything. Story: Roan returns for his second year at the Jedi Academy. Once again, he'll have to contend with a Gamorrean cook, bullies, flight simulators, meditation training, crazy Yoda quotes, and more. The book is all black and white and contains diary like entries, letters home, observations, school newspaper clips, etc. It's more than a simple set of sequential comics panels telling a straight story. But the overall arc is 1 year at school. A lot of this book is very topical and it will be interesting in future years to see just how much it represents the zeitgeist of 2014. It's not really intended for adults and is missing the sly dark humor that can help a kids book transition to a great read for adults as well. As with Diary of a Wimpy Kid or the Dork Diaries, this is fully and solely something that kids will appreciate. Admittedly, I tried to read it and got bored real fast. My 11 year old loves Star Wars and Dork Diaries. So of course she liked this. Her comments were that it was too 'busy' (the fonts are really, really, hard to read) but that it was cute. She would want me to buy the next in the series. Reviewed from an ARC.", "id": "4"}
{"review": "'Star Wars: Jedi Academy, Return of the Padawan' by Jeffrey takes us back for Roan Novachez's second year. In the last book, we learned, humorously, about how he didn't fit in and was afraid he wouldn't make friends. This time around Roan has lots of friends and he's excited because he's going to learn how to be a star pilot. He's also going to learn what happens when you neglect your friends and hang out with the wrong people. There is lots of humor like the first book, and there are lessons that are subtly made. All the original characters are back along with a new school chef who likes to serve up mushrooms and eyeballs from lunch. Also new, is a version of social media for the school and the lessons to be learned there. Master Yoda is along for the ride serving up wisdom and humor in equal doses. I liked this one almost as much as the first one. It's got good lessons about being loyal to your friends and not getting in with the wrong crowd. The humor is great for kids and grown ups. I ended up getting copies of the last one for kids I know last Christmas. I'm sure I'll do the same this year. Jeffrey Brown has created another winner.

{"review": "I've really been looking forward to this sequel ever since I finished the first book. I'd say this one is probably even better than the first because rather than just being a story of events in the life of a first year away at school, this volume actually has a plot. Roan spends the year having a misunderstanding with his closest friends making them grow apart and not really speaking to each other all year. By virtue of being assigned to team up with them for a class project he finds himself with the bully/bad apple kids and starts joining their group feeling good belonging to this \"cool\" but troublesome clique. They are really only using him though because he is smart and it gives them an in on making it easier to tease the \"good\" kids. So overall this is a story of friendship and a good read for that. The set up is the same as last time though I'd classify it as a graphic novel as there are probably more classic panel/bubble pages than other forms such as: journal entries, homework pages, school posters, school newsletter, class schedules, report cards, etc. It will appeal to \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" fans but is also out to entertain Star Wars fans as well.", "id": "4"}

{"review": "All Out War is a two volume spread that serves as the culmination of Rick and Company's dealing with Negan and his band of Saviors. Of course, Negan has been around for quite some time prior to that. While I didn't keep track, I would wager his story arc has been much more lengthy than that of the Governor. Part of the reason for that seems to be that Negan loves to talk. Talk about his rationale behind what he is doing, talk about killing, talk about why he doesn't kill someone, talk about everything and anything. Sure, he acts as well, taking action in a very brutal, and yet somehow rational way, but its his colorfully foul language and monologue-ing that makes him different than the much more no nonsense Governor. I wish I could say that he is as compelling a nemesis as the Governor was-he certainly has the capability of being as brutal, though he is, in some ways, far more dangerous and cunning. But I can't say that with much conviction, even if he did take out a long standing character I was very fond of several volumes ago. There were perhaps a few minor surprises here in Part 2 of All Out War, but I can't say they were something that made this volume very exciting. Since this is the culmination of a pretty dramatic series of events, I was hoping for more. This series has not shrunk away from brutal surprises that were pretty jaw-dropping that closed out a particular story line. This one went out with a whimper, rather than a bang. While I will continue to remain a reader of this series, there needs to be something rather than just another 'big bad' to keep the story moving from here on out.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "Glad it's over. This storyline started strong, but just dragged itself across the finish line. It's obvious that Kirkman and Co. wanted to create a rival to the Governor, the best villain the series has presented. But the character Negan had nothing to distinguish him, other than his over-the-top brutality and foul mouth. Over the duration of this very long story, the question of why a fairly large group of people would follow this nitwit became more and more jarring. While the idea of the various surviving humans fighting among themselves against the backdrop of zombie destruction was intriguing, Kirkman was too determined to stretch the story out to encourage much interest. As a result, I rushed through this volume in one sitting, something I don't do too often, mostly to get through Negan's remaining f-bomb laced tirades. But, as someone else had said, the story ended with a whimper. After over a hundred issues, and twenty-one trade collections (I have them all), after this, I am forced to question whether I want to continue with reading the Walking Dead. I have enjoyed this series in the past, but I wonder if now, in the effort to repeat past glories, Kirkman is going to run this series into the ground. That would be unfortunate.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "Like many others, I have been a fan of TWD since the beginning, and have faithfully purchased every trade paperback. I find the series to be becoming very redundant. It's basically the same story issue after issue. I also find the style of artwork a bit confusing when there are so many characters and most of them look alike. Maybe I am stupid, but I am finding it hard to follow at times. Many people praise the writing, but the dialogue often seems very unnatural and cliché. I will probably continue reading the series just to see where t goes, but I feel like it's a chore to get through it anymore. This issue in particular was very unsatisfying.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "Finally the war with Negan and The Saviors is over. This has taken a long time....too long. As covered in the previous volumes, Rick has enlisted the help of the neighboring communities to tackle the Savior threat. I'm not sure why assassination never came up as an idea instead of the constant loss of life on both sides. The art is the same, like it or hate it. All of the common locations are well rendered and consistent so that exposition isn't wasted on telling the reader where a particular scene is taking place. The Governor has forever set the standard for how evil an antagonist can be. He was brutal and effective in so many ways, but pride got the best of him. The climactic battle and fallout from the final encounter with the Governor has been one of my all time favorite comic book moments. No one has really challenged Rick & Crew to that level since. Negan had some novelty factor with his own community rules, Lucille, and his repetitive use of the \"f\" word. Negan is more than shock and awe, like when he shared moments with Carl during his capture. Much of the last volumes has addressed how morals influence the decisions that lead many to stand up against the Saviors. I don't blame them, the deal they had with Negan was rough. As established as Alexandria etc. were, not sure I would've stuck around with everyone dying constantly. There had to be something worthwhile outside of Negan's reach to start fresh. Anyways, it all ends in this volume. Rick is still in his \"General\" role, with the usual supporting cast of Jesus, Ezekiel, Michonne, and Andrea. Like many WD stories, some major characters die, some new ones are introduced, and some roles change. While I'm glad it's all over and we can move on to the next saga, I was really surprised by the end and where it'll take everyone. I don't review spoiler sites, but already heard that there is a jump in time to the next storyline. I've read from the beginning and will till the end!", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "‘The Walking Dead, Vol. 21’ by Robert Kirkman is latest installment in zombie comic series which describe the dystopian environment ruled by undead which beside comic version infected the entire planet with excellent TV-series. Today released compilation consists of TWD issues from 121 to 126, representing the second part of ‘All Out War’ story and again all the imaginative and skillfully made illustrations are done by Charlie Adlard. Given that I wrote reviews for several last installments, I should again start with the same statement - no matter how often the objections are repeated TWD’s pace dropped, this series still manages to keep its loyal audience who eagerly follows Rick and his people expecting to see their ending or maybe still hoping that there is a possibility to return world to the state as it was before the zombie outbreak. On the other hand I agree that some TV seasons and comic issues are better than others, some even may seem as fillers, the authors running out of inspiration or simply reaping the fruits of previous labor repeating the same proven formula, but then always something suddenly happens which shows Kirkman still has something special, an inexhaustible arsenal of ideas and temptations through which he plans to take his characters. For those few who maybe don’t know for TWD franchise or did not know TV-series is based on comics, the recommendations for primarily its reading certainly stands as the comics provide an additional aspect of imagination which TV-series lacks keeping readers in constant thrill – enjoying the adventures of survivors which are in greater danger from the other remaining people, than the zombies. In the twenty-first installment war between the factions will be concluded - the Saviors on one side, opposite to the Kingdom, Hilltop and Alexandra Safe-Zone united on the second. The way in which the war will end would be great for some readers because it shows that the author does not start using the pattern, while others will probably blame the author for trying to artificially extend the series to the maximum. The tastes are not to be discussed, but I definitely belong to the first group. Still no matter to which side you are considering yourself to be part of, do not expect big bang ending, but more reasonable outcome no matter how unexpected it may sound for a world in which the action is happening. It must be emphasized still the same good thing can be said that, unlike some of the previous chapters, elements of additional character development, emotions and good character interaction can be again found – which remind us loyal fans of the series start, I don’t know how many years ago. Therefore, TWD 21 is another great sequel for loyal fans for which many will again have only criticism; however, together with the rest of us will hardly wait for the new episodes of human survivors exciting adventures in an ominous prediction of future world.", "id": "4366"}

{"review": "I really enjoyed the Negan story line and read the previous four trades to catch myself up before digging into this one. I, alas, unearthed some disappointment: the journey ended up being much better than this ending (which ends up being a beginning). Volume 21 suffers from some familiar problems, like difficultly distinguishing characters from each other (although adding an inker has helped on that front), wondering who the people dying are, and their significance to the story (you know there's a issue when you care more about the tiger's demise in the previous volume than any character's death in this one). Some characters, like Dwight's, portrayal/actions seemed more plot generated than character driven. I'll keep reading TWD, of course, but probably return to hardbacks, rather than these trades, because I don't feel a compelling need to follow the story.", "id": "4366"}
{"review": "Seeing as this is labeled \"Part 2,\" this continues and concludes the war against Negan and his crew. This is the first time I had to look at my watch while reading through a trade. I usually zip through the trades and finish them in one sitting, but this time around I felt it was drawn out far too much, and the conclusion, while somewhat unforeseen, wasn't as satisfying or gut-wrenching as that which the series is known for. At this point, I'd prefer that Kirkman end the series soon. He's let the series go on for a long time and so far it hasn't disappointed, but considering how long the All Out War arc took I think he may be running out of ideas. I don't know where he's going with this; I'll keep reading, of course. I'm so invested in this series that I HAVE to continue.", "id": "4366"}

{"review": "This is a powerful work. The tale of a young man's painful relationship with his father is elegantly interwoven with the father's recollection of life as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Poland. Spiegelman's skill and honesty make this a raw, gut-wrenching read, though the tale is somehow ultimately uplifting. I first read this book as a teenager, and would highly recommend it to people of any age. Over the years, I have re-read it frequently and shared it with friends of all ages. All have taken much from Spiegelman's tale. A few notes must be made in response to the 10/26/97 comment posted below by a reviewer from Ontario, Canada. It is quite clear that this reviewer did not, in fact, read the book. (S)he mistakenly attacks Spiegelman for portraying the Poles as rats, and wonders if he would be offended if a book were written portraying Jews as rats. Anyone who took the time to read Maus (or merely to examine it's cover!) would know that it is, in fact, the Jewish people who are portrayed as mice/rats, whereas the Poles are portrayed not as vermin, but rather as pigs. In fact, far from a \"vicious\" attack against Poles, there are many acts of kindness by Polish people portrayed in the book. Certainly there is unkindness as well, but how can the reviewer forget that this is a factual account of Vladek Spiegelman's life, told from his perspective. If unkind acts by Polish people are a part of that life, then they should be in the book. Finally, the reviewer in question inelegantly raises a point of some merit, though it is one that is only tangentially related to Spiegelman's work. The Polish people did, in fact, suffer horribly at the hands of both Nazis and Soviets alike. Their death toll in the concentration camps numbered in the millions, and should never be forgotten or omitted when discussing the Holocaust. This book, however, is about Vladek Spiegelman, and so surely it cannot be assailed for its focus on events from his perspective. Spiegelman's fidelity to his father's! story is to be admired, not attacked. And certainly not by a reviewer who could not be bothered to read the book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "As a history and literature major, I wrote my senior thesis on Maus and Maus II because, after reading them for a class, I couldn't stop thinking about them. The imagery, both drawn and implied, was masterful. Each panel tells the story of the Holocaust as SOMEONE REMEMBERS IT. Spiegelman took his father's story and graphically interpreted it in an incredibly moving way. He did not write a work of historical fact (for whatever those books are worth anyway - even history is a work of memory and interpretation). I love these graphic novels for what they are - brilliant literature and testimony. I was looking over some of these reviews of Maus because I am going to see Spiegelman speak this weekend and just wanted to know what others had said in the past. I was disheartened to read some of the negative responses to the use of animal caricatures, especially since I have always felt this was the most ingenius part of the works. Looking at these reviews, though, I remembered an interview with Spiegelman I read a while back. He explains the animal caricatures a bit, and I thought it might be beneficial to place a quote here, in this forum. Published in The Comics Journal, October 1991: Spiegelman says of the animal portrayals, \"These images are not my images. I borrowed them from the Germans. At a certain point I wanted to go to Poland, and I had to get a visa. I put in my application, and then I got a call from the consul. He said 'the Polish attache wants to speak with you.' And I knew what he wanted to talk to me about. On the way over there, I tried to figure out what I was going to say to him. 'I wanted to draw noble stallions, but I don't do horses very well?' When I got there, he gave me the perfect opening. He said, 'You know, the Nazis called us schwein' (German for pig). And I said, 'Yes, and they called us vermin (German for mouse or rat).' Ultimately, what the book is about is the commonality of human beings. It's crazy to divide things down the nationalistic or racial or religious lines. And that's the whole point, isn't it? These metaphors, which are meant to self-destruct in my book - and I think they do self-destruct - still have a residual force that allows them to work as metaphors, and still get people worked up over them.\" I guess he's right. People do get worked up over the metaphors. Too bad some of those people can't understand them. If you haven't read Maus, you are missing a true piece of art.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "First of all, if you've read or are reading the other reviews, ignore the blather about how the whole \"Animal Farm\" metaphor--Jews as mice, Germans as cats, etc..--being racist and demeaning. Art Spiegelman attempts to tell the story of his father Vladek's life in Hitler's Europe. By and large, the book is a detailed, objective retelling of his Vladek's story. However, as Art himself will realize, \"I can't even make sense out of my relationship with my father--how am I supposed to make sense out of the Holocaust?\" and \"Reality is much too complex for comics--so much has to be left out or distorted.\" Thus liberated from the impossible standard of complete objectivity, Art is free to insert two important subjective elements into the story--the depiction of different races as different species, and the insertion of himself as a character in MAUS. Obviously, Art is not a overt racist--in fact, in the second part of MAUS, Art will scold his father for distrusting a black person, and a German-Jewish couple will help Vladek return home after being freed from the death camps. The point of portraying Jews as mice, Germans as cats, Poles as pigs, etc. is to show what race relations during Hitler's Europe might have been like. The characterization of race doesn't end there, though--as the scene shifts from Nazi Germany to the present, and as Art must suffer the daily trials and tribulations of life with a father permanently scarred by his experiences, Art depicts himself as a mouse as well, a confession that he himself is unable to completely escape the aftermath of the poisoned race relations of the Holocaust. Maybe this makes him a covert racist. But if he is, then who isn't? Art's involvement in MAUS goes beyond interviewing his father, though. Later in the story we will see that Art was treated in a mental hospital and sees a psychiatrist regularly. As the book cover declares, \"MAUS is a story about the survivors of the Holocaust--and of the children who somehow survive the survivors.\" The storytelling in MAUS is stellar, and the craftsmanship is as well. The comics medium allows Spiegelman to employ some interesting tricks. For example, whenever Vladek is trying to sneak around, he is portrayed with a pig mask. When Vladek and Anja are trying to escape from the ghetto, Anja, who in real life was easily identifiable as a Jew by her appearance, is drawn with a long tail, while Vladek is not. In sum, MAUS is a gripping story of his parents' experience during the Holocaust, filled with countless brushes with death, tales of betrayal, and plenty of terrible, graphic illustrations of victims being executed. It is not a history text in the most austere and empirical sense. Rather, it is a confession that the Holocaust defies dispassionate and detached analysis.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Don't let the comic-book type format fool you: Maus is the horrifying biography of a man who survived(?) the greatest atrocities the 20th Century had to offer. Mr. Spiegelman makes great use of the illustrated book format to allow the reader to meet the Jewish experience under WWII Naziism without rejecting it. Words of caution to any reader: leave yourself enough time to finish the entire volume at once, because you won't want to put it down, and leave yourself time afterward to come to terms with what you have read. I also recommend waiting at least a day or two between this volume and its sequel (Maus II) to avoid overload; Maus is the most powerful, most haunting, and most accessible statement I have encountered on the horrors of the holocaust.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Maus is one of the most amazing comic stories I have ever read. It is so horrifying and so human, yet it never becomes overly depressing and is lightened somewhat by the fact that all the characters are animals. The story is a brilliant mix of Art Spiegelman writing the story itself and trying to come to terms with his father, and his father's harrowing experiences at the height of Nazi power in Europe and in the concentration camp at Auschwitz (although the concentration camp part takes place in the second volume). This volume of Maus is mostly about Vladek trying to avoid the Nazis, as all the Jews in Europe were trying to do at this time. There are many colorful characters and stories packed into Maus, and it is a grim reminder of a dark period of world history. Beware though . . . the second edition (And Here My Troubles Began) is even more horrifying. Maus is brilliant. Buy this and the second part too - there is no way you'll regret it.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "In the two volumes of \"Maus,\" Art Spiegelman has captured the essence of the Holocaust. He focuses his tale on his own family's tragic history, using the strangely-appropriate medium of comic book drawing. Maus I tells the Spiegelman family story from prewar prosperity through the ghetto experience and an attempt to escape the Nazis. Art is a tortured son of a tortured family. Mother and father lived through the Holocaust on their wits and good luck. Now that the war is over, they continue to live haunted lives, never free of the fear and mass murder that enveloped their youth. Art, their American artist child, just barely tolerates his father's obsessiveness and extreme miserliness. The father, while starving in Auschwitz, saved half of his morning rations for trading for shoes or clothes. Now that he is old, he continues to play every nook and cranny of the system in order to save a wooden match or to cadge a free bingo game. The sense of the man's weirdness (and his son's resulting lack of patience) is palpably sad and funny at the same time. Spiegelman's art is deceptively innocuous, using a black and white comic book style. His tale alternates between the present story of his elderly, pill-counting father in the present and the past story of ghettos, cruelty and death camps. Spiegelman draws his humans with animals heads -- an ingenious way to portray ethnic and cultural differences that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. Jews are rendered as mouse-headed humans, Poles with pig heads and Nazis topped with heads of predacious cats. Spiegelman's tale is part history, part expiation of guilt for resenting a brother killed during the war and part rage at a family member's suicide. The war never ended for those who endured it, and ripples through time to damage the next generations. That's pretty heavy for a comic book, but Art Spiegelman pulls it off brilliantly.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This book is a comic book, and it won the Pulitzer Prize. \"Why? How?\" It won for a reason: it is a fresh account of the much discussed World War II Holocaust, told from a single (real) person's point of view. The main character (Art Spiegelman's father) is Jewish, and so is represented by a mouse. Nazis are cats. The mouse (barely) survives a sentence in a concentration camp. The fact that the book is in comic format with personified animals allows you to absorb the story and it's gruesome details quickly and painlessly until you understand the magnitude and reality of it. Then you are overwhelmed, and the book explodes into powerful work of human experience.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "\"Maus I\" is a powerful and awe-inspiring experience. I have never read anything quite like it, I have to admit. It's really hard to comprehend the term \"page-turner\" until you read this very unique and intense tale of surviving one of the most terrible times in history. Written in comic book form, Art Spiegelman tells the tale of his father's hardships and survival in the Holocaust. Vladek Spiegelman (his father) was a POW, but managed to sneak out of one of the camps that held him, only to later have him and his whole family thrown into terrible death camps. Uncertain of what tragedies they would endure or when they may be the next to be sent to Auschwitz, Vladek was always certain that they would make it out alive, no matter what obstacles were thrown in their way. This is a survivor's tale, as well as a tale of how a son tries to patch up a damaged relationship with his father. The account we are given is absolutely horrifying, but at the same time triumphant. I literally could not put this book down once I started it. It's a very fast and easy read. This is a great advantage because this makes it easier for those who do not read a lot to be able to read it without any problems. It's an important tale that needs to be told and it is one that needs to be read by as many people as possible. The Holocaust is something we should never forget and it's something that needs to be taught to everyone. This book is a great way to get people aware of the situation who may not know a lot about that terrible time. The comic book structure and style really makes the story work. While this is something I could've read in plain text or in a regular novel, the drawings help you experience just exactly what is taking place. It makes it easier for you to want to continue reading without forcing you to strain yourself. The style and structure also insures that more people will give it a chance and read it. \"Maus I\" is an important tale of survival, hope, hardships and family. It's a tale worth being told, that much I can assure you. If you have never read this before, I strongly recommend that you pick it up sometime and give it a chance. It is an easy and fast read that will give you an experience like none you have ever encountered. It may be a sad and terrible tale to hear, but to know that somebody can survive such a horrendous scenario like the Holocaust and come out of it alive just goes to show you how strong a person can be, both inside and out. It is an important tale that deserves to be heard by as many people as possible.", "id": "2"}

Don't make the same mistake I did and wait a month. Read it as soon as you receive it. They both became two of my three favorite books. Spiegelman delivers a very touching representation of his father's Holocaust experience. Whenever the subject of literature and the Holocaust come up, I recommend it. Most of my friends have read it at my suggestion and they all echo what I've written here.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "A few years ago, when I first read MAUS, I was filled with trepidation at the thought of a comic book about the holocaust. As a holocaust educator, I worried that any trivialization of the topic might do more harm than good. After I finished reading MAUS, I walked away believing it did a better job of communicating the loss, suffering and lifelong consequences better than almost any novel or scholarly work I had ever read. Spiegleman could have bombed on this one: too much 'comic book' or too much history would have ruined the work and caused a nightmare. Instead, he found the most remarkable juxtaposition of human understanding and tragedy communicated sensitively and sorrowfully, in a way in which those of all ages can identify. My concerns about the Jews portrayed as 'mice' were quickly allayed: these mice had more humanity than most people. The metaphor was so powerful and 'receivable' that I do not think it would have worked any other way. I would recommend it for High School and above, because of its intensity, but at the same time it's hyper-reality is so magnificent that no one studying the holocaust or Shoah, whether at the beginning level or far into a scholarly career, should escape reading it. It is a masterful classic and has left a lasting impression on me for the entire time of my own studies. Elizabeth Kirkley-Best, PhD, Director: Shoah Education Project (Web)", "id": "2"}

This book goes through a good list of the security measures for all the most used technologies and softwares. I certainly learnt something from this, I'm sure anyone that picks up this book will as well. Highly recommend!", "id": "5"}

{"review": "I had chance to browse through 'The Destiny Limited Edition Strategy Guide’ by BradyGames immediately after it was released, for two reasons – I’m big fan of BG guides and more importantly I was very curios how this great and highly anticipated game will be covered in guide. And though I had no chance still to read it page by page and honestly, very few people I think do that with strategy guides I’m again more than pleased that BG covered this one as well because it makes the game even more fascinating and appealing. Speaking about the content, inside its covers reader gets: - 400 pages of Destiny related information - Beautifully looking hardcover edition with two exclusive lithographs - Complete and detailed overview of Destiny universe, including guides to reclaim hidden treasures and ghosts, maps and strikes, weapons and enemy information together with high-level armor for each character class - The Field manual with numerous advices and strategies to enhance your gaming experience both in PvP and PvE modes - Complete overview of multiplayer part of game including tips how to get the most out of the game - Access to a digital version of the strategy guide - One of three limited edition cover designs (Titan, Warlock or Hunter) hidden underneath well-designed double-sided dust jacket - Large format of Director's Map As I said still have to take some time to go through it and also need to consult with other younger members of my family, but only because of the above mentioned 'The Destiny Limited Edition Strategy Guide’ can be seen that this is guide each game fan would like to put hands on enabling to additionally enjoy and squeeze out some more things from the most anticipated game for a long time. Given the details, size and number of different possibilities which can be done inside the game If you such guide will be more than welcome for players who don't want to spend lot of times on-line searching for some information or tip providing such information on one place. Few words about design - this hardcover edition with its great look additionally adds to the overall impression of work well-done making it a must-have for each game fan. Though I’m bit weak when it comes to BG guides, you can be sure when it comes to design and content this is guide you’ll love to have. Therefore, compliments for BradyGames and looking forward to spend some time with 'The Destiny LESG’ which I fully recommend.", "id": "5"}

{"review": "I buy guides expecting few things. Detailed maps, information on achievements that can be missed, showing where collectables are. This guide failed me on all three levels. There are two collectable items in this game, good chests and dead Ghosts. While this guide does a decent job of telling you where the golden chests are, it's absolutely worthless when it comes to the dead Ghosts. Instead of locations being pointed out on the map, or even notices when to look for them in the walkthrough section, the only time they are mentioned is at the end of each location where it has a generic list with three or four word \"hints\" that are mostly garbage and unhelpful. The fact that this guide doesn't help with an important collectable pretty much ruins this guide. Why pay so much for a guide that doesn't actually tell you where the dead Ghosts are? You really are better off using online sources instead. This is the only strategy guide I have ever returned before. Don't waste your money on this.", "id": "5"}

This book will last for a very long time under normal book wear and tear conditions. The content of the book is also very well done and presented. It goes through a lot of redstone components and explains what they do, and also shows you how to build a couple redstone contraptions. I only gave 4 stars however because it really only gives you 10 or so redstone machine plans, all of which are rather easy to build. As a pretty seasoned minecraft player, there wasn't too much new information for me in this book but what was there was very high quality. If it had given more complex redstone machine plans i would have given 5 stars, and I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is either new to minecraft or doesn't understand redstone very much.", "id": "4"}

CNB Minecraft is a great worker of the redstone and has a great youtube channel for walking players through many redstone devices from simple to complex. His methods are both elegant and functional. Often as compact as minecraft will permit. He brings that same ease of use to this book (by 'scholastic') on how to use and control very simple Redstone devices, all the way up to massive logic arrays. Detailed and illustrated.

{"review": "‘Minecraft: RH OMB’ is useful guide to Redstone, one of the more complex parts of Minecraft world. Advertised as a guide made by and for Minecraft experts that will take you through all the aspects of Redstone, it manages to show these characteristics for the most part, although there are some more minor details on which could be worked on in order to truly becomes the ultimate guide. I have such an opinion mostly due to the lack of crafting and using of ballistic projectiles, though in terms of everything else it is a great complement to Beginner's Handbook with its tutorials that among others explain mining, smelting, circuit components and circuit designs usage. As a nice add-on for kids which want to learn more, inside its covers can be found some exclusive tips from game creator and some cool Redstone creations. So if until now you used a Beginner’s Handbook, and you want to have on one place virtually all information about Redstone, this manual will please you. Let's only hope that its small flaw will be corrected in the next edition because only that makes it just as step away from the ultimate guide.", "id": "4"}

The book isn't overly technical yet is a huge eye opener for anyone who isn't intimately familiar with the details of Kevin Mitnick as the most wanted hacker of the 90's. If you have a moderate interest in computing, you'll encounter many jaw dropping moments in reaction to the clever, often brazen and sometimes paranoid escapades captured in the book. Towards the 3/4 mark in the book, the story gets a bit drawn out, but was completely well worth the read.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "When it comes to true crime, I'm pretty squeamish. Nothing violent, please. Clever and devious are what I'm looking for. Frank Abagnale's Catch Me If You Can: The True Story of a Real Fake is one of the best, and it's hard not to compare any subsequent caper story with it. Ghost in the Wires doesn't reach the level of audacity of Catch Me if You Can - impersonating technicians over the phone doesn't rise to the sheer nerve of a teenager impersonating an airline pilot or a doctor, as Abagnale did, and getting away with it. But Ghost in the Wires goes well beyond the adolescent bragfest of phone hacks that it could have been. I think this is largely due to the co-writer, William L. Simon. Kevin Mitnick describes in his acknowledgments, how he and Simon argued over how detailed and technical the book should be, and apparently Simon prevailed. There's enough detail to explain how the scams were possible, but not so specific as to send the non-programmer into a hexadecimal stupor. Another big plus is that many of the hacks depended as much on what Mitnick calls \"social engineering\" as on specialist knowledge. Unlike the stereotypical computer nerd, Mitnick was as comfortable and proficient at schmoozing people as he was writing code - he could talk his way into places that were restricted and convince people he was entitled to classified information. These were scams anyone can understand. Mitnick also succeeds at not crossing the line from confident to insufferable, which is another pitfall of true crime tell-alls. Perhaps we can once again thank William Simon for this achievement. I expected to skim this 400-page book but ended up reading every word. Mitnick was unbelievably audacious, and he says he never profited from his exploits. Knowing the risks (especially after he had already spent an unpleasant stretch in jail), how could he continue to risk getting caught again? He claims he was addicted to hacking, and while that seemed to me a sorry excuse for criminal behavior, it started to seem like the only possible explanation. Whatever Mitnick's reasons, Ghost in the Wires is as much fun to read as any summer thriller.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I know that many people love Ghost in the Wires, but this book really bothers me. It's very difficult to be sympathetic towards Kevin Mitnick, who continually prevails upon his readers to let him have it both ways. I will leave whatever social sickness the brilliant Kevin Mitnick has to the mental health professionals, but suffice it to say that his writing in Ghost in the Wires is a terrific nonfiction example of an \"unreliable narrator.\" Throughout the book, Mitnick does the same things over and over again and is surprised when he repeatedly gets caught. He hurts his mother, grandmother, wife, and friends over and over again with his illegal hacking activities, says he regrets doing it each time, but then turns around and does it to them again. Mitnick is upset when he is blamed for things he \"didn't do\" and when he is \"double crossed,\" but he freely admits to dozens of other computer break ins and instances where he compromises the trust of others using \"social engineering\" techniques, ridicules them for trusting him, and then betrays that trust. Mitnick says he never took money from hacking, but now of course he's making money from writing this and other books as well as from promoting his computer security company based on his (illegally obtained) skills. Mitnick is all over the place. In one scene Mitnick is severely critical of prosecutors who use \"dirty tactics\" to put him behind bars, but then he continues to use his own dirty tactics while behind those bars. For instance, Mitnick is contemptuous of being put in solitary confinement so he can't \"phone freak\" (a form or hacking using an ordinary telephone), but then uses his severely limited (and monitored) prison pay phone time to phone freak anyway by dialing behind his back as a guard watches, apparently just for the thrill of it and with complete disregard for any consequences. Even after he is apprehended multiple times, Mitnick still doesn't \"get it.\" He is condescending to and openly critical of the FBI, local law enforcement, and the media throughout the book for their lax procedures, but still doesn't seem to understand why breaking and entering highly sensitive computer systems is wrong and dangerous. When they find his stolen database of thousands of credit card numbers, he doesn't understand why he should be prosecuted for possessing them because he didn't actually use them to steal money. \"That would be wrong,\" he says. Another instance: he spends most of the book using cloned cell phones to make \"free\" calls all over the world, which are billed to unaware random consumers. This form of theft, as well as repeated breaking and entering, both electronically and physically, seems to be viewed as no problem. While on the run Mitnick takes great pains to steal and set up new identities in Las Vegas, Denver, Seattle, and Raleigh NC, but each time he goes back to his old hacking and cell phone tricks only to get discovered again and again. In one scene he finally figures out that he is being tracked electronically by the authorities when he uses his cell phone, and is actually being followed by a helicopter that zeroes in on him every time he makes a call. Does he then stop making cell calls? No. Does he stop hacking? No. Even when he is suspicious of being compromised on the phone, he still keeps calling and talking \"for hours\" to the informant, and yet feels betrayed when they turn over what they have to the authorities. Mitnick seems to blame everyone but himself most of the time for having the unmitigated gall to trust him through his so called \"Social Engineering,\" which he both repeatedly relies on and harshly criticizes his marks for falling for. He even blames others who actually create the computer systems he feels compelled to compromise. It is much more difficult to create than it is to tear down, and instead of compromising these networks for \"trophies,\" one is left wondering what the incredibly talented Mitnick could have done if he had spent as much time and energy building systems instead of breaking into and stealing information from them. Mitnick's behavior is deeply disturbing. He writes, \"It always seems strange to me that my captors had such trouble grasping the deep satisfaction that could be derived from a game of skill....what it was worth didn't matter to me. So what was the nature of my crime, that I allegedly had access?\" It is not a game, and Mitnick completely misses the point, even now, after serving years in prison and being released. Mitnick is obsessive about his own privacy, and yet is utterly indignant about others' attention to and expectation of theirs? It just doesn't wash.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "A fascination with hacking goes back pretty far for me (I'm an old bat). I loved my experiences reading about Kevin Mitnick, even when he made the papers while on the go. The papers were full of hyperbole even then. I knew to reserve my excitement and hold out for Kevin's own words. My patience is rewarded with this book. I can't help but enjoy reading about someone who has the adept social engineering of a film noir gumshoe, or the undercover detective, who applied it growing up and getting into trouble. Like Kevin, I knew The Three Days of the Condor. I learned it was a favorite of his, and I clung to this fact which fell through the sieve of newspaper myth. Free Kevin! Now read Kevin's story, where you'll find enough detail to keep any heart racing. Whether or not you have enough awareness for some of the bits, or rely on the plain language, the story can strike sheer terror in the hearts of those who don't know much of anything about bits and bytes. For those who do, this book contains updated method nomenclature and references to security protocol that it's valuable from that perspective. Kevin possesses the kind of curiosity to dig and uncover gems of hidden info for esoteric purposes in order to unlock a power only a successful hacker knows about. Social engineering is akin to the confidence game, but different all the same when it involves computer networks. The best hackers are never caught, never known about. Kevin has a different distinction: The first and the grandest adventure story, ever. You don't need to be a hacker or security professional to appreciate and learn from it. Today, security is serious business and hackers typically have bad or misguided intent. Kevin's motivation was harmless fun at the expense of a system, and honest curiosity which was not rewarded with a government security detail. Fear prevailed then, as hacking was an unknown phenomenon. An innocent motive seemed totally suspect in a court setting. One frequent result of being a trail blazer is its potential costs. When playing around with the law, this can end in time set aside from society. The NYTimes columnist ironically exercised his own opportunistic free market exploit to establish a mythology around Kevin that ruined any chance for freedom. Kevin emerged from lock down to write the correction that I hold in my hands. The highest adventure possible for any security professional.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I just finished this book and it is excellent. Kevin Mitnick was finally allowed to tell his side of the story after all these years and all the other \"fake\" stories of his life and capture were made. The book is really good at explaining technical topics in a very high level so that anyone who reads it of all skill levels can understand what is going on. For security professionals, this book is a must read. Sometimes in the world of IT security we get so hung up on firewalls, exploits, SQL injection and all the cool techie things but the completely forget about the social side of security and out users. This book will allow you to see the importance of security through user awareness training, strict procedures to follow, etc. For people outside of security this is a great introduction for anyone who is worried about how hackers commonly steal information and break into systems. The book will never leave you with eyes glazed over in getting down to the really techie details. A lot of people have views of hackers that they see from the movies which is really crazy nerds with crazy monitors who can break into anything in minutes (think swordfish). This is far from the case with real attacks often taking months to years. The book really does a good job at making users understand that they are the most critical asset when it comes to securing their organizations data as well as their own. The crazy software products are important, but in the end it comes down to the users and what they will do. I managed to briefly meet Kevin Mitnick at Derbycon (a security conference) this year and he was nice enough to sign my book which is really a nice added bonus!", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I read this book and then read it again to my wife and daughter. We all loved it! Kevin takes us from his early years, giving a good chronology of how he went from being a typical 9-year-old kid to the FBI's most wanted hacker, and ultimately, a sought-after security professional. Reading it was a good mix of suspense (how will he get out of this one and what will happen next?) and comedy (did he really just go and do that again?). He takes you with him and if you're at all familiar with any of the cities, you almost feel like you're there with him. This writing team also does a great job of balancing the stories so that there's enough \"geek talk\" for my appetite on the \"how he did it\" and enough straight, clear talk for my family to follow along and enjoy the story as well. Oh, and for those of us now working in the corporate IT world, it's a HUGE eye opener at just how vulnerable we still are in spite of our expensive security systems.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I really enjoyed Ghost in the Wires. It tells the story of Kevin Mitnick in his own words and clears up any misconceptions that arose due to other books and movies about Mitnick. Kevin Mitnick has an amazing mind. His memory and his ability to remain one step ahead of law enforcement and other hackers put him in a league of his own. The amount of detail in the book is phenomenal as well, especially since some of the chapters cover things that happened well over a decade ago. The suspense made it hard to put the book down. I was amazed at the dichotomy of Mitnick's genius and his often childlike curiosity when dealing with phone and computer systems. He is a true hacker with an unrelenting need to know how things work. The book also exposes the corruption and illegal methods used by authorities to finally track Mitnick down. Basically, Mitnick was so clever that they would have never caught him without breaking protocol and using illegal cheapshots when tracking him down and searching his apartment. The final chapters of the book and the closing comments say a lot about Mitnick's character. Although he had access to documentation that would have allowed him to steal vast amounts of money, Mitnick did nothing of the sort. The information itself was the prize. Although he would have every reason to be angry with Shimomura, he noted that he respected the man's skills. Mitnick also expressed remorse for putting his mom and grandma the pain of his fugitive and jail days and expressed thanks to his family and friends for standing by him despite his \"criminal status\". The book is well written, and Mitnick's humor and sarcasm contribute to an already interesting story.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Mitnick's biography is interesting, but not a stellar read. It's written largely for a non-technical audience, and it does a good job of showing Mitnick's inability to stop hacking, if not an outright addiction to hacking. While it shows that he didn't hack out of malice or to make a profit, Mitnick is not a pure white hat hacker. But the hacking stories become repetitive over time, and it seems strange as to why he would continue to hack knowing that the police are getting ever closer to him while a fugitive. Also the book wraps up very quickly, glossing over his capture, trial, and imprisonment. If you've read Mitnick's other book, \"The Art of Deception,\" you're already familiar with Mitnick's ability with social engineering.

It was hard to put down! I personally know and am friends with some of the people in the book (Derrell, Andy G. and Anton). Come to think of it, this is the second hacking book where I knew some of the players! The first being the Cuckoo's Egg. (I got to know Dave Cleveland and Wayne Graves and Andy G. is also mentioned in both) Ghost in the Wires had me yelling at the book, saying things like \"dammit Kevin! Why?!\" and \"don't tell me you didn't encrypt the tapes!?!?\" I was amazed at the audacity and shear hutzpa. As I told Kevin today via Twitter, \"you've got balls\". I got why he was doing stuff like this. The geek curiosity is addictive but here it's taken to a whole new level. You get to witness a photographic and cunning mind in action and it doesn't disappoint. You don't need to be a geek to appreciate what's happening. The book is way more about social engineering than bits and bytes. It's a view into the workings of the human brain and brings up a lot of doubt around trust. I was fascinated with his ability to get people to trust him! It's pretty scary. Go read this book and you'll find yourself questioning the next person who says \"trust me\". Some back story: I was hacked by Kevin around 1988/1989. More details at my blog, yelof.com. Read \"A dinner with infamy\" and how I finally got confirmation 20+ years later. Kevin told me today that he should have included this story in the book. I hope you enjoyed this. Thanks!", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Kevin Mitnick's recollection of his life is wonderfully enticing. Through the writing talents of William Simon, Kevin's story entraps the reading in a maze of understandable technical jargon, interesting encounters with many kinds of law enforcement, and most importantly his purpose in hacking. As each chapter comes to an end, you are left with a desire to continue reading. I found myself turning pages with the same enthusiasm I felt when reading Stieg Larsson's millennium trilogy.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This book may be to Data Science and Big Data what Freakonomics was to Economics. The author is one of the founders of the dating web site OKCupid and has spent a lot of time sifting through the vast amount of data collected by user interactions with their website and each other, and he uses this wealth of personal and private information to explore what it can tell us about human social behavior. The writing is excellent and it is a very fun read (I was hooked by the second page of the introduction, finished it in a couple sittings, and was never bored). There's lots of information in this book that will make you think, and a lot worth talking about more. I think it's at its best in the first part where the theme is \"things that bring us together\" and he talks about statistics relating to how people find each other on his dating site. In the second part of the book \"what pulls us apart\" he deals with issues like race and what his data shows about the prevalence of racism in American society, as well as the internet's capacity for rage. The last part of the book \"what makes us who we are\" continues with the relationships theme as he investigates a few more racial as well as gay and bi-sexual issues before covering a few miscellaneous topics like comparing the kind of uses of this data he makes and his vision of using it for good compared to things like marketing and government spying. People who consider themselves Data Scientists may be bothered by the fact that he does not go into much formal detail and actually few of his analyses require any fancy math or a PhD in anything. It's a book that I can strongly recommend to anyone, both as a fascinating look into human behavior as well as an introduction to the sort of things that web sites are doing with all that data they collect on you, and as inspiration for those who aspire to the new discipline of Data Science, both in terms of the sort of things you can accomplish as well as some of the moral and ethical issues involved. Probably the most interesting and thought-provoking book I've read in a long time. G.", "id": "5"}
{"review": "Christian Rudder, one of the founders of the dating service OkCupid and a Harvard trained mathematician, offers us insights from some really big social media data bases. Using analytic techniques to look at overall trends, rather than predictions about individuals, he demonstrates an ethical way to use all of the data that is collected on people who do Google searches, use dating sites, tweet on Twitter, and \"friend\" people on Facebook. The results are not always dramatic or interesting, but it is amazing how much can be determined from the on-line behavior of millions of people. He offers, for example, a very credible estimate of the percentage of the population that is gay. He also has an interesting analysis of how people reacted when it became clear that Obama was going to be our first black president. The only reason I did not give this book five stars is due to the author's tendency to throw in unnecessary profanity and sarcastic comments. I think he intended these to be humorous, in at least some cases, but I found them distracting interruptions in the flow of an otherwise fine book. Rudder has a number of really wonderful graphs in the book, showing the trends in the data sets. These are inspired by the work of Edward Tufte - see The Visual Display of Quantitative Information for example - and he could not have chosen a better role model. One of the most interesting parts of the book, to this geeky reader, was his final Note on Data which should be the standard that all researchers in this type of analysis.", "id": "5"}
{"review": "Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OkCupid and; therefore, has had access to a plethora of digital data. By studying this data, he has come to some very fascinating conclusions which he shares in Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking. The book is broken down into three sections: What Brings Us Together, What Pulls Us Apart, and What Makes Us Who We Are. Within each section he explains his findings in a very entertaining, easily understandable manner. Findings such as how Twitter can actually improve a person's writing and how a simple analysis of one's Facebook friends can determine the future success of his or her relationship. The issue of privacy as it relates to what we give up versus what we gain is also addressed. I found it an enjoyable, eye-opening read. I won an advance copy of this book.", "id": "5"}
{"review": "The author implies that this book presents data which will change the way we see ourselves. Not true. Instead, what we have here are snippets of often interesting but, for the most part, unrelated bits of data sourced variously and without mention of method. There are two issues with the data itself. It's not cohesive. That is, the author doesn't drive toward a point or perform research. Instead he samples this or that he apparently either finds interesting himself or he thinks the readers will enjoy absorbing. Some of the data is worth thinking about or discussing around the water cooler tomorrow at work. The other issue is the interpretation the author puts on the data or the lack of it or something or other. A good deal of the data is taken from the dating site, OKCupid.com which the author started along with two others. Any person who's taken Statistics 101 can tell you that this sample has a few issues from self-section to it not representing humanity as a whole. For example, you can be well assured that no happily married folks had anything to do with these data sets. Aren't happily married people part of `humanity'? The second issue starts with the author seeming to make a good deal out of nothing. In one chart with frequency of words used to describe oneself cross tabbed with race, he finds Hispanic males rarely describe themselves as having a southern accent, having blue eyes or being a redneck. I believe the author's data here, but did I need to see this chart to know these things? In another chart, how men rate women's looks is cross tabbed by women's race. The chart shows that black women are, and are by far, rated as less good looking than Asian, Latina or white women. So what do we take from that? Well, I can think of several things other than maybe your first blush thought. Maybe good looking black women are so popular that they don't need to go to OKCupid.com to find their dates. Maybe black women take crummy photos of themselves. Maybe the nature of OKCupid shows black women's thumbnail pictures up poorly. I can go on. Here, again, I believe the author's data but I don't see the reason it was published. The final part of the book is a well-considered and well expressed diatribe against the war on privacy being waged by several entities and abetted by your behavior online. Your behavior with your cell phone, OnStar equipped car and debit card are also contributors among other things. While the author laments this loss of privacy as if it's a future event, I have news for you: that ship has sailed. Aside from some amazingly poorly worded personal musings, the expositional writing acceptable if not elegant. Overall worth a read but not a breakthrough of any sort.", "id": "5"}
{"review": "If you are a Twitter user, congratulate yourself: your average word length is greater than Shakespeare's. If you are a man or a woman, I know what age group you find most attractive. I also know those naughty and bizarre things you search for in Google. Okay, I fess up. I don't know YOU, but I know the collective representation of you thanks to Christian Rudder's new book DATACLYSM. And, dang it...I know a bit more about myself, too. Rudder got me interested in his book when he started talking about the dating site he co-founded, OKCupid. So much data! I loved peeking in with him as he explored what happened when photos were removed from the site and people went on blind dates (hint: ugly folks make great dates). Then later when the pictures were made larger (hint: beautiful people received tons more messages; homely folks even fewer than before). Everything was extrapolated, even down to the average keystrokes versus average message length of messages (can you figure out how 1,000 letters are typed just by pressing 10 keys?). Rudder kept his Harvard math powers rolling through Twitter, Craigslist, Google, and--my favorite--reddit. WARNING: I spent way too many hours last night rolling through Google trends. Be prepared. You will lose precious time fondling the data in this book. One more thing: Rudder is hilarious and insightful. Describing what we learn from Google, he writes, \"It's the site acting not as Big Brother but as older Brother, giving you mental cigarettes\". Going back to Twitter versus Shakespeare (average word length 4.8 versus 3.99, respectively), Rudder writes, \"Looking through the data, instead of a wasteland of cut stumps, we find a forest of bonsai.\" As for the data on his OkCupid site, he writes, \"People saying one thing and doing another is pretty much par for the course in social science.\" The one thing I can complain about is the length of the book: I want more! At 300 pages, I would say about 100 of those pages are devoted to end-of-book references and section-introduction pages. The good news is that Rudder has his blog with tons more data, and the book has its own site, too. The book's site is supposed to have several tools on it, such as an algorithm to predict if you are going to divorce or break-up based on your Facebook profile. Those features were not available before the book's publication. Bottom line: tons of data and insight provided through creative charting and exquisite writing. I love it. Thanks to Crown for sending this to me for review. Pure awesome!", "id": "5"}
{"review": "One of my favorite books of the early 2000's was \"As the Future Catches You\" by Juan Enriquez which was initially published 13 or 14 years ago. At the time, that small book seemed cutting edge in part due to the creative typesetting as well as ability to tie seemingly disparate concepts into a unified whole view of the future. This book is like an updated and expanded version...there is literally nothing not to like! First, those with a moderately strong background in statistics...or those studying statistics, qualitative and/or quantitative research methods will find this both entertaining and insightful. I would go so far as to say that books like this should be the foundation from which to \"teach\" these methods in an engaging manner rather than those dry old approaches that remove every vestige of interest from the average student. In any case, this book is absolutely filled with sometimes pointless, often insightful and always fascinating bits and pieces of data. The author takes a refreshingly honest approach to data...it isn't the end all be all solution. There are very real limitations of what can be used and what can't. There are also amazingly vital pieces of seemingly small but oh so very important findings to be had for those that know how to look. Perhaps more importantly, this provides a glimpse into the often hidden world of personal data and what it means for business, individuals and knowledge management.", "id": "5"}
{"review": "This book is fascinating, insightful, and hilarious. It's sort of a survey of the types of things that are possible to see about the way people behave and who they are on a large scale at this moment in place and time. It's using Big Data to look at people's behaviors and preferences and so forth not to try to sell them something or to see if they're terrorists but just to see who we are as people, to help us see things about ourselves, and I think hopefully to help us ask ourselves some tough questions. It's not comprehensive, because considering the huge trove of data and the complexity of humans, that would be nearly impossible, but the areas the author chooses to examine are thoughtful, poignant, and at times downright surprising. A lot of things seem to just show things that we might have thought intuitively, but that didn't make it less fascinating to see the behavioral statistics showing it to be true. It's easy to be like, \"men are like this and women are like this\" or \"black people are like this and white people are like this\" or whatever, but to see some of this stuff borne out so starkly in the data, I thought it was incredible. And the writing is highly readable. Somehow he turns a book about data into an enjoyable page-turner that I didn't want to put down. Much of the book is laugh-out-loud funny, while some sections are sobering, bordering on depressing. But none of it was dry or boring. And I'll probably read it again.", "id": "5"}
{"review": "A few years ago, I had read some online research that had been generated from the OKCupid.com databases and found the results quite intriguing (related to using `game theory' in improving ones chances in the dating market). This book is written by one of the founders of that site and contains a significant amount of `big data' detail that they have analyzed since then, including many topics not related to dating at all. As a guy with a background in statistics coupled with being a (former) veteran in the dating game, I found this volume to be a stimulating and entertaining work. The writing is fresh and concise, the analysis is cogent, and the graphs are detailed but presented in a refreshingly simple two-color layout. Reading this volume will be highly rewarding for anyone interested in social economics, sociology, big data applications, game theory, social networking, and the work of Nate Silver and his FiveThirtyEight.com site. I would strongly recommend anyone currently in the dating market to read this work because only one personal epiphany will be worth the price of `admission'.", "id": "5"}

{"review": "This book is like a social snapshot. Christian Rudder, the author of Dataclysm is one of the founders of the online dating site, OKCupid. He obtained his data from this site using vast amounts of user information and interactions. Rudder says he relied on the work of statistician and artist Edward R. Tufe. He reports that the median user of OKCupid is 29 years old, less religious than average, is more urban and more educated and progressive than the nation at large. Let me add that they also are internet users. They have personality characteristics which make online dating, communicating with strangers and taking chances seem okay. They’re mainly single; maybe shy, maybe socially maladroit. Another reviewer said that this book will be enjoyable for those with a ‘moderately strong background in qualitative and quantitative statistics’. There is a lot of digital data, and many graphs and tables. This book was difficult for me.

{"review": "I'm all for convenience and no leftovers. I've been making things in mugs for years, so I was interested to see what this had to offer. I'm not sure if it was released before it was finished or if this is all there is. First, the description says you get 25 recipes. Uh ... no. You get 11 recipes, most of which are quite good (of the ones I tried, anyway). The description also says you can choose between sweet and savory recipes. Uh ... no. Except for one breakfast dish (which is also sweet), all recipes are for desserts. No lunch or dinner entrees, no savory recipes at all. And with only 11 recipes, I hesitate to call this a \"book.\" It's really a pamphlet or booklet. Now all that said, the recipes in here are quite nice, most of them. A couple of them call for ingredients that I don't normally stock in my pantry (brown rice syrup?). I particularly liked the cheesecake (I used the graham cracker crust from the S'mores recipe to make a graham cracker crust for my cheesecake because, well, that's how I like cheesecake), which I topped with mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries); the French toast (bread pudding -- and really, this recipe begs for \"personalization\": it's quite good \"as is,\" but you could add all kinds of things to it to make it your own (cranberries, raisins, dried apricots, cherries, etc.); and the 5-Minute Chocolate Fudge S'mores Mug Cake, which is really yummy. I also made the Chocolate Espresso Mug Cake, but be aware that there are a couple of errors in the recipe: 1) it calls for \"drinking chocolate powder or sweetened cocoa powder,\" but no where in the recipe does it tell you when to add it. I assumed it went with the rest of the dry ingredients; and 2) it calls for \"egg- 1 no\" -- still haven't figured out what a \"1 no\" egg is, but I used a regular large egg, and it worked fine. So this could use a bit of editing, I think. So the bottom line: this is really a pamphlet, and the Book Description above is not really accurate in terms of \"savory\" mug recipes or in the number of included recipes. But the 11 \"sweet\" dessert and breakfast recipes seem to be of decent quality if you're willing to make some educated assumptions about unclear instructions/ingredients. For the cost of less than a dollar, it might be worth it to have these in one place for reference. Solid 3 stars: it's OK.", "id": "6"}

While I would not say that I will NEVER eat grain or dairy again, we both have noticed an improvement in various symptoms since we found the Paleo lifestyle. Our health and weight are actually quite good for our age (60), and neither of us is the kind of person who feels 100% adherence is a must when you are choosing something just because you feel it is healthier for you. I am mentioning this, because I read one review by someone who objected to a mention of adding optional cheese to a recipe in this book. She clearly said it was optional for those who did dairy. I also have switched from some condiments that have wheat, like soy sauce. So maybe for the very few recipes that suggest an ingredient that is marginal, optional or not totally Paleo, you will just want to substitute or leave it out. The vast majority of these recipes, though, do adhere to Paleo rules, so don't get the wrong impression. What I liked most is that these are real recipes for people who actually like to cook, and they have a broad range of flavors from traditional to ethnic. It isn't one of those books where the recipes are all about mixing prepared things together. You use actual herbs, spices and veggies. It is a bit time-consuming to make some of the recipes compared to making hot dogs and beans for lunch, but the results are great, as with the beef stew I made last week. Some of you might go, \"Cinnamon in beef stew?\" But I promise, it's great. The author combines flavors that raise these soups and stews above the average for slow cookers. And the quantities allow you to have some to freeze for later, making up for the time you put into preparation. I tend to be someone who really likes to have a color photo of a dish in a recipe book, so that was something I missed. Also, I like books with LOTS of recipes in them. This is a short volume, but I was quite pleased by the selection she included. And you can't beat the price. So for me and my husband, this book was a winner. I will be using it a lot. I love my slow cooker, and this is just the ticket for me. If you love to cook, and you want Paleo slow cooker recipes, I recommend this book.", "id": "6"}
{"review": "I was excited to see a Paleo slow cooker book. As many moms know working full time and still trying to feed your family healthy food isn't always easy. Slow cookers can be a life saver quite often. As I started looking through these recipes I found that I had a problem with this cookbook. There are recipes that call for Worcestershire sauce, BBQ sauce, sherry cooking wine, half & half (or almond milk, at least there's a choice here), tamari sauce, wild rice, cheddar cheese, and parmigiano-reggiano. Yes, the book says to buy gluten free, but just because something is gluten free does NOT make it Paleo. This is a gluten free slow cooker cookbook, not a Paleo cookbook. The only reason it doesn't get 1 star is because it at least gives me ideas. I'm not trying to be the Paleo Police, but if something claims to be Paleo I expect it to be Paleo, not partially Paleo.", "id": "6"}
{"review": "I am pre-diabetic - and looking at these recipes - my mouth is watering because a) I can eat these amazing dishes without worrying about sugar, and b) paleo recipes are also gluten-free. Although I am not a person who suffers with all the symptoms of celiac disease, I do have a lot of issues that seem to be related to it. I am trying to avoid white flour and sugar. This wonderful book contains all kinds of recipes - for all kinds of main dish meals, but also soups and other things. I loved the lamb dishes in here - I'm going to be spending a lot of time experimenting with these, particularly now that the weather is cooler! Thanks, Amelia, this is a great resource for new and different healthy dishes! Loved the presentation and the pictures, too.", "id": "6"}

With fall and winter on the way, I love using my crockpot for dinner meals, but finding healthy recipes is not easy. This cookbook is GREAT! Not only does she provide several recipes for different meats and fish dishes, but she also provides soups, and even breads (I know - HOW do you cook breads in a slow cooker - you'll have to buy it to find out!). Best of all, she recommends healthy ingredients for every recipe. LOVE that! I cannot wait to try some of these recipes, and I'll report back on our favs. For 99 cents, this is a fantastic price, and even at 2.99 I think it would be worth it.", "id": "6"}

{"review": "This is a fun recipe book with lots of scrumptuous ideas. Each recipe includes a nice photo, a list of ingredients, and directions for preparation. There is also a nutritional guide for each burger, including protein, fat, calories, sodium, etc. Although I would love to try these burgers, I admit I was scared off by the fat and sodium content. Although I enjoyed reading the book, I was distracted by oddities. Perhaps the author could check the following: (1) There seems to be a disconnect in the title of this book in the Kindle edition, versus what is shown on the Amazon website. The title page of the Kindle does not agree with the title on the Amazon page. For a while, I was actually in doubt if I was reviewing the right book. (2) Suggest fixing the chapter called \"History of Hot Dogs.\" Nothing wrong with re-using chapter ideas from prior books, but this threw me for a minute. (3) Some of the the recipes do not include the bun in the ingredient list, when the picture shows the burger with a bun. I found this confusing in so far as whether the calorie count includes a bun or not. For example, see the \"Green Chickpea Burgers.\" (4) I believe some of the calorie counts are way too low. The \"Bison Onion Burgers\" is listed as only 200 calories? Is that possible for such a large burger with a large bun? I would have thought 400-500 calories. Also, the 1/4 lb \"Nutty Burger\" can't really be only 150 calories, right? Aside from the above nits, the book is well-written and informative. I would be happy to re-visit my review if the author decides to issue a revision. I encourage the author to make these corrections, as the book would then really shine.", "id": "6"}
{"review": "The book gives you burger recipes to try from bison to turkey. The recipes include approximate nutritional Information to use and servings. The recipes are good enough to make alone but involving your kids can take these burgers to the next level. I recommend turkey Caesar burger.

{"review": "It's good to have a new repertoire of recipes. I have a slow cooker but was making mostly veggie rices and meals like that. In these recipes there is a bunch of preparation with a lot of veggies which is a most in a healthy diet! cons: I know it's a cookbook about Low-Carbs diet, but i don't think having fruits is a bad things. Of course there is sugars in it but it digest and metabolise very well with the fibers the fruit contains. It's not like White-Poison-Sugar hehe. Just saying ; )", "id": "6"}

{"review": "When my wife and I watch TV, some of our favorite shows are the cooking competitions on cable networks like Food Network and Bravo. Lately, it seems like the hottest shows are the ones that tickle our sweet tooth (Cupcake Wars, Just Desserts, Sweet Genius, Last Cake Standing, etc.). And the hottest of the hot are cupcakes, which have become art forms as well as tasty delights. After seeing an online sample of \"Yammy Diet Cupcakes,\" I downloaded the book, which includes more than three dozen recipes for cupcakes that the author says contain fewer calories and less fat than regular cupcakes. The color photographs of each recipe are very appealing, and the recipes are complete with easy-to-follow directions. The author states that these cupcakes contain fewer calories and less fat that regular cupcakes, but with most recipes, it wasn't obvious how the reduced calories were achieved. Some recipes included the number of calories and grams of fat, but this information was omitted for some recipes. I would have also liked to have seen the number of grams of carbohydrates, with a subtotal for sugar. I know that artificial sweeteners have to be limited in baking, so the texture and browning characteristics aren't negatively affected, but some of the icings could have incorporated artificial sweeteners to reduce the total amount of sugar in the cupcake. Using the recipes in the book should yield some very tasty desserts.", "id": "6"}
{"review": "I’m not sure who Cookie Baker really is, but I’m pretty sure that American English is not their native language and they really needed an editor. The book starts off with a description of what cupcakes are: “They are named cupcakes because they are made in small thin paper cups.” Now that we have that clear, Cookie Baker tells us that cupcakes can be served anytime, “as desert and any occasion”. I’m glad we can eat them on the desert, but I don’t live in the desert anymore. This introduction, while non-essential to the recipes, is full of accidentally amusing statements as the misuse of language continues. It varies from awkward and stilted to genuinely a bit confusing, as with “Because of their size, one diet conscious person feels less guilty after having them.” While the “Yammy Diet” is completely unfamiliar to me, these recipes didn’t seem to be lower in fat or sugar, so don’t expect these cupcakes to be healthier in any way compared to your favorite recipes. The photos look like something you’d buy in a bakery or fancy coffee shop, but there is also no hints as to how to get that great look in the directions, which typically tell you to ‘spread cupcake with frosting and garnish with sprinkles’. Even better yet, the recipe for “Paris Cupcakes” tells us that we’ll need “fondant harts” (they look like candy hearts like is sold at Valentine’s Day with words on them.) Each recipe also has pictures, although it would be nice if the pictures were a bit larger, as they are very small. I may use some of the recipes eventually, but this book didn’t jump up and say yum particularly. On the plus side, the table of contents is fully functional. It was not difficult to navigate through the cookbook on a Kindle Fire HD.", "id": "6"}
{"review": "Cookie A. Baker has very wisely discovered a weak spot in all of our food temptations - cupcakes - and has the good idea of making these delectable little naughties low in calories! What could be better? The pleasure of noshing on delicious forbidden sweets without the guilt that would otherwise accompanying that diversion from dietary health makes of a terrific cookbook to keep handy for those `weak' moments. Among the nearly 40 recipes, each accompanied by a beautiful color photographs of the finished product and with detail instructions on how to gather the ingredients and make and bake and frost them are the following: carrot cupcakes with orange icing, chocolate cream cheese cupcakes, Brownie cupcakes with peanut butter frosting, Chocolate raspberry protein cupcakes, chocolate almond cupcakes with coconut frosting, mini vanilla cupcakes, mini Paris cupcakes, cranberry cupcakes with dulce de leche pecan frosting, pumpkin pie cupcakes, lemon blueberry cupcakes, pumpkin protein cookies, pina colada cupcakes, sweet potato cupcakes, white chocolate cupcakes with candied kumquats, tropical cupcakes, strawberry angel food cupcakes - the list goes on. This is a very well conceived, well-written cookbook that should please every taste bud around. Recommended. Grady Harp, October 13", "id": "6"}
{"review": "Yammy Diet Cupcakes consists of a number of very delicious recipes for preparations like Pumpkin With Cream Cheese, Peanut Butter Banana, Coconut Frost, Red Velvet and Cream Cheese Cupcakes.The book is well organized and easy to read and apply. Each preparation is listed with a picture in the preferred mode. The ingredients are provided, although a number of preparations have a lot of sugar - some are listed with brown sugar which is a better choice over white sugar. For people with glucose issues, naturally based stevia is a preferred alternative to white sugar. Many desserts are laden with sugar and this aspect is a major contributing factor in childhood diabetes, as well as, adult diabetes and pre-diabetes. The book would be better offering stevia as a substitute for sugar in all of the preparations. Otherwise, the book has some very attractive dessert preparations.The book is highly recommended although readers should substitute stevia for sugar if they have glucose issues.", "id": "6"}

{"review": "I just finished \"Suspect\" by Robert Crais and happened upon Unspoken Bond. I sometimes like dog stories and was intrigued by the cover, so thought I'd read the sample. I'm glad that I did. I liked the detailed, \"down home\" writing style so much that I got the book and read it with enthusiasm. In Unspoken Bond, the reader is quickly drawn in by a gripping scene where a puppy gets abandoned by the side of a road. Then, the book introduces the main character, David Hess, who is having a hard time during his final year in university. A really hard time: he's seriously disturbed by the breakup of his engagement and his increasing disillusion with his likely future. One night, while drinking with his room mate at a club, a tall brunette makes eye contact with David, acting like she knows him. She walks over to David, leans into him, but before she can ask him a question, her new husband, Colby Taylor, puts a stop to it. A fight ensues, which is one of many action scenes in the book. David, Emma, and Colby are the three main characters and author O'Connor takes time to develop them carefully and, I think, lovingly. The dog, Joe, is an important character, but not the main one. He's more the catalyst for making things happen and there is plenty of action: fights, war, firearms, explosions, trampling bulls, snipers. The list goes on to make for a page-turning book, although a sensitive and thoughtful one. This is definitely not your boy-rescues-girl kind of thing, an action thriller, a war novel or \"just a dog story\" - it's more a story about life itself. Women should like this story about a strong woman, but here is plenty of stuff for men to like too. Unspoken Bond is well worth the time to read and I kept thinking about it when I wasn't reading it. It wasn't until I read the \"About the Author\" section at the end, did I realize that this book was based on a real event.", "id": "48"}

{"review": "I was drawn into this story from the very beginning by the vivid descriptions. The author did a good job of pulling my strings and making me care about the characters as they go through their own personal stories of triumph and tragedy. The individual stories were woven together; paths alternately intersecting and diverging and you find yourself pulling for David and Emma to make the connection. O’Connor kept me turning pages until the end. This is a book well worth reading.", "id": "48"}
{"review": "I live in Austin and graduated from UT a few years ago. My dad suggested I read this book, and at first I was reluctant, but found that I got sucked into the story really quickly. My family has always had a dog, so when I read the part about the dog getting dumped on the highway, I found myself turning the pages as fast as I could. The characters are believable too, because Austin has just about every type of person there is. The scenes in Austin were spot on and the scene in the football stadium brought back a lot of memories. I can tell you that Sixth Street is the place to party, and I have seen guys like David and Colby duke it out over a girl. The writing was fluid, and you'll root for David and Emma to get together. It takes a while, so be patient when reading the book. Close to the middle of the book it got kinda slow, but a lot of books have slow parts, so it wasn't much of an issue. The pace kicks up immediately in Part II with lots of action and interaction between all three characters. Of course, Joe is right there too among everything that goes on. O'Connor ties in the beginning and ending of the book quite nicely, so without giving it away, I think readers will like the way she wove all the characters together. It's hard to categorize this book, but there's something for everyone - dog owners, guys, gals, recent grads, ex-military, and anyone looking for a good story. Overall, well done!", "id": "48"}
{"review": "Although I wish the author had let the characters develop a bit more from their actions and dialogue as opposed to my being told about them, I did think this was a sweet love story and it was an easy read. The characters were likable, although the good guys were almost too good and the bad guy too bad. I loved the dog, Joe. Possible spoiler alert--I really liked the ending where Joe's past comes calling. I'm wording it that way so I don't say too much about the ending. So why a 3 star instead of a 4 or 5? Although I liked the story I found myself skimming it towards the end instead of actually reading it. A really good book should keep me intensly interested right up to the end. Then there were the mistakes that stood out to me: 1. When my son graduated Marine boot camp they did not have a \"stage\". They stood in formation on the parade ground. 2. Marines are always Marines. However, many times throughout the story the Marines were referred to as soldiers. Soldiers are army. To call a Marine a soldier is to invite a dressing down! 3. And I'm not sure if this is a mistake, but again referring to the time my Marine spent in the various \"sandboxes\", severely wounded Marines/soldiers were sent to Landstahl in Germany, they were not kept at the FOB. Then there was the timeline. I wish the author would have put dates in the chapter titles to help keep the storyline from becoming confusing. Overall, this is a book I could recommend for light reading, but it isn't one I will keep on my Kindle now that I've read it.", "id": "48"}

Intasia knitting creates pictures while knitting with yarn on bobbins and I will try the cute owl washcloth project in the book. I might even get the nerve to try a Fair Isle Knitting chart, which looks like pictures on the right side and a tangle of color on the other. It might take me awhile to try Entrelac knitting with all the diamonds, but the basic information makes me think I can do it. Steeking, or cutting knitted work to put in armholes and zippers is presented as is beautiful mosaic and double knit instructions.

You will definitely be the star of the party (well at least your food will be). Most of the recipes are seafood and veggies, however, many of them could have beef and pork substitutions easily. Some of the great ones are Veggie Samosas, Black beans with chorizo, chipotle lime crab crisps, chocolate and peanut butter pretzel twists, Haitian chicken pate puffs and a wonderful onion ring recipe!!!", "id": "6"}

The book is basically divided in two, twenty five unique appetizers and twenty five snack recipes. It is important to mention that most of the recipes here contain shellfish and nuts ingredients so if you are allergy then you are warned already.

{"review": "For those of us interested in history, or perhaps simpler more organic ways of doing things, this will prove a interesting and entertaining read. This book really is about the way our mothers used to do things. It's full of recipes, heavy on sweets, rolls and cakes. ( There is a Jelly Roll recipe in the book I am destined to try.) The book is also chalked full of tips on preserving meats and veggies. Needless to say some of the recipes use some old terminology, like soured milk, but if you have any questions about that a simple google search will produce the desired results with instructions as to soured milks. The real joy for a history lover comes in some of the old household tips. For instance the book lists early potpourri ideas as \" ways to remove offensive odors from the home\" It suggests sprinkling coffee over hot coals from the fireplace. That would work! It also says sugar burnt on the fireplace shovel purifies the air. ( May have to try that and see what it smells like) It is also chalked full of common sense tips like not allowing children to eat snow. Some a bit questionable like to soften to leather shoes rub them with Kerosene. Says nothing of the smell and hazards that might cause or how to remove the smell from the shoes once rubbed with Kerosene. All and all this book is a enjoyable read.", "id": "6"}
{"review": "I only gave this book a 4-star rating because the formatting is not very good for Kindle; everything's the same-size font and line after line. But the recipes would get 5-star ratings because they are very old recipes that you don't see every day. Since when have you seen a Huckleberry Dumpling recipe, or filled cookies, Old-time Gingersnaps, or recipes for Butterscotch that include \"This is very nice when cooled on snow?\" There's Beef Stew with dumplings (not the southern-style, ladies)and for the fun of it, there's Crust Coffee and Coffee Jelly. LOL Cool! What-d'ya expect for free?!", "id": "6"}
{"review": "This is the most interesting book! The recipes call for ingredients like molasses, lard, butter, etc. - all natural foods. In the back of the book there are some housekeeping ideas such as this one: = Dish Washing Made a Pleasure: \"First of all, remove all refuse from the dishes. Place them near the sink, large plates at the bottom, then the smaller ones, then saucers. Have a large pan full of very hot water. Make a good soap suds by using a soap shaker. Wash the tumblers and all glassware first, and wipe at once. Use a handle dish cloth (which can be bought for five cents), for these, as the water will be too hot for the hands. Wash the silver next. Have a large pan, in which to place the clean dishes, cups and bowls first. When all are washed pour over them boiling or very hot water, and wipe quickly. Pans and kettles come last. Always have a cake of sand soap or a can of cleaning powder, for scouring the pie plates and bottoms of kettles. It is very little work to keep baking tins and kitchen utensils in good condition, if washed perfectly clean each time they are used. Wash the dish towels, at least once every day, and never use them for anything else. With clean hot water, clean towels, and plenty of soap dishwashing is made easy. If you live in New England, your sink will be in front of a window. Be sure and plant just outside of this window nasturtiums, a bed of pansies, morning glories and for fall flowers, salvia. These bright blossoms will add to your pleasure while washing dishes.\"", "id": "6"}

Ya gotta, at least once! Just not in like, let's say, Jersey. The recipes do have that 'old granny's recipes' feel to them. I love that. I am a recipe hog and I actually buy old ladies' recipe boxes on ebay so I can find things that have gone out of style.

But if you tell yourself that you can only have 1/2 banana a day, you'll love it so much more!

{"review": "I love lemons and I love using natural cleaners of all kinds but I was not too impressed by this book. The author seems to be adding- on lemon to many very basic and well-known cleaning recipes where cheap, white vinegar would probably work just as well or even better. One in particular that caught my attention was for: Unclogging a Drain: baking soda, 8 OUNCES of lemon juice and boiling water. That's a LOT of lemon juice to waste on a drain! Again, white vinegar would work just as well or better for this problem. I've used vinegar and baking soda in drains for many years but would never waste lemon juice like this. Makes no sense.

{"review": "This is THE book to help anyone prepare themselves properly for an interview in today's world. Most companies now have SBO (Situation, Behavior, Outcome) type questions in their interviews, and if you don't have prepared answers to these questions, you are dead in the water. This book will help you be on top of your game and seperate yourself from the others, if you do the work. It's not hard - you are basically just telling stories about yourself - but you need to take your time and write them down - but this book will guide you. When I graduated college later in life, I had worked at the same company for 8 years and had never really had a \"real\" interview, as my advances were automatic based on my work. I was scared to death to interview. My friend lent me his version of this book, and by the time I was done preparing, I interviewed with several companies and had 4 job offers at one time!

{"review": "I recently changed jobs after over 15 years in the same position. I purchased the book to refresh myself regarding interview questions, tactics, and the overall process of preparation for an interview. The preparation work that Mr. Fry has you go through are very helpful. Basically, you do a self assessment so when you get asked questions like: \"tell me something interesting about your self,\" or \"what mistakes have you made,\" what kinds of people are your friends,\" or \"tell me your life story,\" you're more prepared for that type of open ended, behavioral type question. Also, he provides good answers and bad answers (green light / red light) model for a wide variety of questions which are helpful. Even though I've interviewed a lot of folks, I've not been interviewed in a long time. This book was a great refresher. For the younger folks and millennials, there's a lot of common sense stuff that you should know, but maybe don't.... no offense, but I'm trying to be candid. I recommend this book to all job hunters - especially less experienced folks.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The main helpful part of this book is the beginning section and his \"job data input sheets\". Fry takes you through a long process of cataloging your career to date. It helped put things in perspective for me, and got me to write down details I was starting to forget about older jobs. It also created a framing method for me to look at my previous jobs in a different way, specifically less as a collection of duties and more in ways that are useful in the job hunting process. I also found that I was developing answers to use in \"story\" interview questions. I will definitely be using this method going forward to track future jobs. Like all X number interview question books, this one has a long list of questions with example answers. What makes it a bit more helpful than most, is before giving the sample answers (both good and bad), the author takes a few sentences to explain the thinking behind the question. This helped me to better envision my own response. The short sample answers were also general enough to be useful to me, rather than some books were the answers are so involved and industry specific that I cannot see how to adapt it to my situation. The book is not well-written literature. The stop lights are rather silly and his attempts at jokes rarely work. Some of what is covered is self-evident to all but the most socially awkward. I found myself skipping over some sections. But the core of the book was very useful in getting me through the process of analyzing my career to gain the material needed for the next step - the resume and job search books (loved the \"Knock 'em Dead\" series).", "id": "3"}
{"review": "As a recruiter I would recommend this book to any candidate who needed advice on how to be interviewed. 101 Great Answers to the Toughest Interview Questions, provides a detailed, step-by-step process that any candidate, experienced or novice, can use to prepare for an interview. Candidates are told to prepare a series of worksheets documenting their experience, and formulate answers to predictable but challenging questions such as \"Tell me about yourself,\" as well as the dreaded \"What would you change about yourself?\" The idea is to prepare the best possible response, not as a way to fake it, but as a way to avoid mistakes when one is on the spot. For each question, the book contains an example of a good response, and pinpoints the many areas that might trip up a job seeker . Unlike many books for job seekers, this one provides solutions for experienced and inexperienced candidates. The evaluation technique goes beyond the vague common sense advice provided by most websites. (Be on time, be positive, use spell-check. tell them your greatest fault is that you work too hard...) The book includes good information on phone screens. Given the large number of resumes that companies receive, phone screens are a routine step in the process. This book gives the experienced candidate a way to prepare for a phone interview where things like eye contact, are not possible. Fry advises candidates to be honest, and to present themselves in the best possible way. What could be better than that?", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The title of this review says it all, but I'll add a few comments regarding specific things that I liked and disliked in the book. My background: I've interviewed for a variety of positions in chemical engineering, hospitals, professional schools, and most recently the pharmaceutical industry. I've also interviewed and evaluated candidates in hospital settings. I purchased this book hoping to gain additional valuable insights to augment my past interview experiences, but I found the vast majority of advice in the book is either common sense to any experienced job seeker or too general to be especially helpful. POSITIVE ASPECTS -The recommendations for the dreaded \"Tell me about yourself\" question are spot on and detailed--easily the most valuable ~7 pages of the entire book. -Tips on analyzing one's strengths and past accomplishments should help new job seekers as they prepare for first-time professional interviews. -Easy read--most readers should be able to finish this over the course of an afternoon or less. NEGATIVE ASPECTS -Example responses--if actually repeated verbatim in an interview--would sound extremely artificial, robotic, and would definitely never land you a job. I understand that these only meant to serve as examples, but placing them in quotes may fool some readers into thinking that this is exactly what interviewers want to hear (to be fair, this is addressed in the book, but it's buried in the fine print). -As mentioned previously, this book contains a lot of common sense that most readers should (hopefully) know: bathe, wear a nice suit, maintain eye contact, be confident, research the company/position, match your strengths and skills to the position, answer the question that they ask you, don't ramble, etc. -Sometimes the book reads a bit too sarcastic and unprofessional. Passages such as \"You Brought Your Cat. How Nice.\" and \"You reek, bro!\" don't really add to the credibility of the author. OVERALL Don't bother purchasing--you can download a free pdf version of an older edition of the same book (4th, 2000) that essentially covers the exact same points.", "id": "3"}

Ron lays out the kinds of questions you can expect to be asked in an interview and provides examples of GOOD vs. BAD answers. On top of that he explains WHY they are good or bad answers. This is huge as it helps you get inside the head of the person interviewing you; helps you understand their wants and needs so you can fulfill them with whatever skills/knowledge/experiences you bring to the table.

{"review": "It's been a few years since I wrote my original review for the earlier edition of this book. Back then, I was a student taking the exam in order to get into college. However as a tutor I have taken the exam multiple times since I applied to college, gotten a few more 2300+ scores, and now pass on my knowledge to the next generation of students vying for competitive college admissions. The first thing I tell my students to do is to buy the Official SAT Study guide. It's simply the best. Why? Well, first off, let me start with the changes to this new edition. It now has 10 practice tests, three of which are recycled from the new administration (now that they've given enough tests to disclose them) and seven from the original book. So I'll say now that it may not be a good idea to buy this if you have the older edition, but this newer edition is much more useful since there are three *real* exams. Other than that, it's pretty much the same as the old book. The review sections are divided into three categories: critical reading, math, and writing. The reading section isn't all that helpful. A few obvious test taking tips and some practice passages with explained answers. Good for a warmup, but not much else. The math section, the most substantial in the book, is pretty useful. It contains most of the facts from middle schoool/early high school math that you've likely forgotten by the time you're a junior or a senior. It also has some sample problems to show you the kind of \"out of the box\" thinking you'll have to do: SAT math isn't a factual recall or \"plug 'n chug\" exam, but the section does give you the facts you need to survive. And finally the writing section. The review section has a lot of information, including good writing habits as well as a set of grammar rules. The review sections, as I've mentioned, have good sets of review problems (that do NOT overlap with th practice tests) that will get you used to the *type* of questions, but it is the practice tests that will take you from small sprints to the longer marathon. Each practice test is comprised of real questions or questions of real-standard (mostly recycled from 10 Real SATs -- the predecessor to the first blue book). I usually suggest to my students to do two or three exams untimed but continuously, two exams in pieces (do individual sections timed), and the rest under real, pressured conditions (in a library or other quiet place preferably). Not only does this get the student used to the format, but it will get the student to try to devise ways to make his or her thinking more efficient and suitable for the exam. The College Board, when it says the SAT can't be prepped for, is telling a half-truth. No, you can't prepare for it by cramming lots of facts, but you can prepare through practice, and in that practice your SAT skills don't just go up, but your ability to handle academic situations. Your thinking becomes clearer. So I wholeheartedly reccomend this second edition of the Official SAT Study Guide. It's more useful than its predecessor because it has more tests and more accurate tests, and if used effectively can be the single best tool to prepare for the SAT. Good luck and best of luck with college admissions. Don't see the SAT as an obstacle; see it as an opportunity to show what you can do.", "id": "8975347011"}

I've running out of good materials for my students, and using College Board is really the best prep, since the CB writes the test. However, I was really disappointed when I got this book. They've added 3 tests at the beginning that are taken from October 2006, January 2007 and May 2007 - definitely a benefit if you don't have access to copies of original tests. But the rest of the book just uses the same tests from the original 2005 version, with very slight changes in some of the critical reading questions (changes that were much needed, I think). If you're going to buy this book as you begin your study process, this will help you understand how the test thinks. But if you are buying this to supplement the 2005 version, be aware that you're only getting 3 new tests. You be the judge of whether that's worth your money.", "id": "8975347011"}

The Bad: If you own the first edition of this book, you are going to get ripped off by buying this one. It contains many of the same tests. This is a case where 7 + 7 does not equal 14. There are repeat tests; shame on the College Board. They have access to about 50 old tests, so why repeat tests? One answer: GREED ! The Ugly: How the heck do you include so many ERRORS in one book?

{"review": "I have always believed in that old adage, \"an old exam is better than brains.\" How true! Here is the lowdown on the official SAT study guide: First: You can ignore all of the introductory material. If you have to read it, you are in trouble already. Second: Take the first test first. Score it. Now you know what you need to do. Third: Underline all the words you don't know in the test that you just took. Learn them now. Four: Take the second test. Score it. Repeat step three. The key to this guide is to do each and every practice test if time permits. You will become increasingly familiar with the format and style of the questions. For the verbal questions, keep writing down the words that you don't know. For the math questions, figure out what to do on the questions that you missed. When the real SAT comes, you will find that the math questions are all the same, but with different numbers. The verbal questions are all the same, simply with different reading passages. For 20 bucks, you have just significantly raised your score. And isn't that what it is all about?", "id": "8975347011"}
{"review": "I am a professional SAT tutor in San Diego with nearly 10 years of full-time experience, so I was excited to see that the College Board has finally released a new edition of this book. The last 7 out of 10 tests in this book are taken directly from the 1st edition of the Official SAT Study Guide. The new tests (first 3 tests in the book) are a welcome addition, especially since they provide actual scores in the conversion tables, instead of just score ranges. However, the College Board should have included more than 3 new tests in this book. In the last year alone, they have administered 21 separate \"live\" versions of the SAT, all of them scaled accurately. So why not pack this book full of completely new versions of the SAT, with accurate score tables to boot? Furthermore, there is a glaring (and embarrassing for the College Board) error at the end of the book. The answer key for test #10 is the wrong key, and in that answer key, there are two sections labeled as section 6. All in all, this book is still worth the cost, despite its flaws.

This is a nifty, no-frills guide to maximizing your Kindle's potential using free content. To that end, the author, who obviously loves his subject, outlines many sources of free reading material, including books and newspapers, and he uses screenshots generously to help the newbie or tech-challenged understand. The first few pages of this 53 page guide are devoted to where to get free books. Weber also introduces you to his own website, which sorts through the myriad Amazon freebies each day and picks out the highest rated for the discerning reader. The next section is devoted to tools to help manage your library and convert files to usable formats. He introduces the reader to the freeware program Calibre, which can also be used for newspaper feeds. The author also provides some information on how to use the productivity features of the Kindle Fire, and useful information on apps and utilities. As the title suggests, the bulk of the content is Kindle-related, but there is still useful information for users of other e-readers. I really learned a lot from this book, being somewhat new to e-readers (I have an e-ink Nook and a Kindle app on my i-touch).

{"review": "First off, if you could only buy one test prep book for the ACT, I would wholeheartedly recommend The Real ACT prep guide. This is saying a lot coming from none other than an author of another ACT prep/analysis guide! The main advantage of this book is that it has tests which contain REAL questions made by the ACT organization. While other books may tout having \"(Insert High Number Here) ACT practice Tests\", the one serious shortcoming of all these books is that the questions in these tests are not real ACT questions made scientifically and validated statistically by the ACT corporation, which has adequate funds to employ such methods. Another huge advantage of this book is that it gives detailed explanations for every question in the five tests that it offers. While many other unofficial test prep books give explanations for their answers, the questions themselves are not scientifically validated like the questions from the test makers. The explanations to the questions explain the concepts behind each question, as well as why the wrong answers are wrong. This book certainly provides an enormous amount of useful material for your hard earned money! The book's main downside, however, lies in the introductory content sections before the practice tests are introduced. In the math section, for example, the guide tells you that you need to have a clear understanding of basic trigonometric relationships to be successful on the test. On page 55, the book gives you an example problem and simply tells you that you must use the sin relationship to answer the question. However, it does not state the definition of the different trigonometric relationships needed for the test, such as sin, cos, and tan(and in some cases: cot, sec, and csc). While looking at real ACT tests, I have seen many questions in the math section where the test asks one to evaluate a specific trigonometric expression, such as \"What is the tan of (specific angle in triangle) in triangle ABC\". A clear understanding of these identities is indeed needed to solve these problems, but the ACT prep guide fails to define these, assuming that the reader already has a firm understanding of them. A prep guide does not have to go into the detail of a text book, but it should at least define the core concepts that will be tested. The prep guide also tells you to think about the question extensively before writing anything down- not a very good idea. When approaching a problem, you should always write expressions or representations of the problems, as it is much easier to see relationships on paper than in your head. Using your pencil frees up storage in your short term memory, so you can focus on the approach to the problem. Strategies that are not often beneficial with regards to the time constraints of the test are also present in the science reasoning introductory content section. For example, on page 115, the guide states that it is important to read the text thoroughly and make notes in the margins before you approach the questions. Because of the extreme time constraints of the science section, it is very hard if not impossible to completely understand the introduction to the experiments in each passage and still have time to answer all of the questions. The English section fails to mention a few concepts such as parallel structure and other smaller concepts that I have seen on multiple real ACTs in the past. Despite these shortcomings in the introductory concept sections of the Real ACT Prep Guide, it is still an invaluable resource for ACT test prep. No other company can make ACT questions like the ACT. Even my book, Dissecting The ACT 2.0: ACT TEST PREPARATION ADVICE OF A PERFECT SCORER or ACT TEST PREP WITH REAL ACT QUESTIONS, is dependent on real test materials that the ACT provides free of charge. Using and analyzing real test materials is the single best way to prep for the ACT, and this book has five of them. This book is an improvement over the previous edition because it contains an additional TWO tests on top of the three that were present in that edition(these three tests have not been changed). Aside from these additions, nothing has changed with regards to the content or layout of the book. It is absolutely worth your while to purchase this version if only for the two additional and extremely valuable real practice tests. However, you should save your money and get the non CD edition of the new book, because the CD does not have any information pertaining to test prep, but rather general information about college, planning your major, etc. Bottom Line: A must have book, but use only the practice tests and explanations to the questions on those tests. Ignore the rest of the book since it contains quite a bit of bad advice. This is based on my experience of taking the real ACT and getting a perfect score of 36. For ACT content and strategy there are other better books, but no other book gives you five real ACT tests.", "id": "28"}
{"review": "Five official tests instead of just 3! I have been waiting for this book's release with bated breath. (Yes, this is the exciting life of an ACT prep instructor). However, I wish I could write separate reviews for the book with CD and without the CD. Once again, I paid the extra money for the CD, which promises to include \"supplemental test preparation and skills based exercises.\" And once again, there are no test prep resources on this CD. It is a college planning CD from Peterson's with college planning advice, lists of undergraduate majors, etc. (The back inside cover of the book lets you know the CD is for college 'planing' -- a typo that does not inspire confidence!) I am really disappointed in what I feel is incorrect advertising here. However, I do want to note that The Real ACT Prep Guide itself is absolutely essential for prep. This is my tenth year of test prep tutoring and I always find that students who prepare with real ACTs have more confidence and get higher scores than those who don't. The more tests, the better, so it is wonderful to have five to work with. I should probably mention, however, that the skills review and strategies in this book are sub-par. The ACT company just isn't going to give all that much away. For the past few years, I have used The Real ACT Prep Guide along with Boost Your Score! The Unofficial Software Guide to the Real ACT with great success. It gives diagnostic feedback for the tests in The Real ACT Prep Guide and provides strategies and resources.

{"review": "As a full-time test prep tutor, I know that students who take several real practice tests do better than those who don't. Unfortunately, the previous edition of this book only included three tests - so I was happy to see this edition includes five. Take all five of these tests, and you'll be familiar with what the ACT will throw at you on test day. However, don't expect the ACT to give you insightful advice about its own test in the answer explanations - those explanations are usually convoluted and technical. I highly recommend you buy this book instead of books written by test-prep companies like The Princeton Review, Kaplan, and the like. Those companies have neither the resources nor the motivation to make their practice tests highly accurate representations of the real ACT. Most students and parents, unfortunately, are not familiar enough with the real ACT to realize this until test day.", "id": "28"}
{"review": "Hurray! Finally, a new edition of this book that includes two additional practice tests! I was happy with the first edition and was excited when a second edition came out, but the only difference was the update to the table of national distributions of ACT percentile rankings. That data helps students who take the practice tests to better estimate what their percentile rank will be, but nothing else about the second edition was new. It was a disappointment. So now, as someone who provides ACT test prep for a living, I celebrate the inclusion of the two additional tests in this truly new 3rd edition. Having plenty of practice tests is a huge bonus for highly-motivated students for whom three tests is not enough. In addition to the \"5 real ACT tests previously used in actual test administrations,\" the book includes a complete summary of the format and content of the test, offers practical suggestions for test-taking strategies, and provides detailed explanations for each of the questions on all five tests. If you are looking for the best overall ACT test prep book, look no further. All the other test prep book companies have fake practice tests made by the employees of that company, and please believe me, they are NOT the same as a real ACT test. I worked in test development for years, including at ETS, which develops the SAT, and I assure you that the amount of work that goes into a real standardized test is staggering. Those test-prep companies can't replicate it. Really. Buy this book. If you do all five of these tests and want still more practice tests, search online for old versions of the ACT yearly publication, \"Preparing for the ACT\" in PDF form. They are easy to find. If that's not enough for you - you insatiable test-taker, you! - then go ahead and get a book from Barron's, or McGraw-Hill, or Kaplan, or Princeton Review, but don't be surprised if some of the math questions look familiar, as one (perhaps more than one) of the above publishers \"borrowed\" at least one of the real ACT math tests and just changed the numbers a bit. A little, little bit. Sorry, don't ask which one. Other reviewers have commented that this book does not give a thorough enough content review. And they are correct. Of the four ACT test sections, math is probably the one for which people need the most actual content review, and this book does not provide a comprehensive systematic review of math content. If you need that, you will need to investigate other books. The other three test sections do not lend themselves as neatly to a content review. I do review grammar with my students, but I use my own materials that cover only those principles that are likely to be tested on the ACT. (I have had only one student who was interested in a comprehensive systematic English grammar review!) The concept of a content review does not apply in the case of the reading section, and the science section is not content-based; it is a science reasoning test based largely on the ability to read and interpret graphs, tables, and figures. So the book's lack of \"content review\" is not as serious as it might at first appear to be. Oh yeah, this new book also includes a CD on college planning, which you will probably never use. If you can get the version without the CD for less money, buy that one. In either case, this book is a great value. I have been using successive editions of the book for seven years to coach kids in ACT prep and I intend to continue using it along with my own materials. Buy this book! Use it to its fullest!

My senior year included an English 101 writing course, and pre-calculus. Both classes greatly helped me improve in their respect studies. If you want to improve your reading score, this book will NOT help you. Reading for speed is something you build with practice, and reading for different elements of literature is something you build by taking a moment to reflect on text you read.

{"review": "I am using this book as a study tool for my Gross Anatomy course. Anyone who has taken an anatomy class can tell you that color-coding structures is one of the most helpful ways to remember them. There are drawings of bones, muscles, joints, organ systems and explanations of virtually everything that could possibly be covered in an anatomy class. The drawings are excellent and most of the features of the bones are labelled as well. This was very helpful to me since I had to memorize virtually every tubercle, ridge, groove, or other protuberance on every bone of the body. When I had trouble with the skull because the drawings in my class notes were horrible, the drawings in this book were much clearer and helped out a lot. If you are taking an anatomy class, this is a smart and relatively inexpensive investment that will help you remember everything better.", "id": "75"}
{"review": "IMPORTANT: Make sure you READ ALL the information in the section labeled \"INTRODUCTION TO COLORING\" BEFORE you start coloring your first page. This is located on pages \"xii\" and \"xiii\" in the front of the 4th edition. This book is very well thought out and there really is a \"method to the madness\" if you actually read and follow the directions. I've found it beneficial to read through all the NAMES first, checking for parts that have similar names. Second, choose SIMILAR COLORS for SIMILAR NAMES or FUNCTIONS. For example, I chose Red, Orange and Yellow for the \"Levators\"; 2 colors of Blue for the \"Zygomaticus Major\" and \"Zygomaticus Minor\"' and 2 shades of Brown for the \"Depressors\" (page 44). Then look over the basic diagram to get a feel for the order which they appear in the body. Assign the colors in order by location in the diagram. For instance, go from back to front as follows: Red (back), Orange (middle) then Yellow (front). This natural color transition helps solidify the order they appear from postier to anterior or superior to inferior (whatever the case may be) etc. NOTE: I realize this takes extra time planning your colors, but it really makes it easier to memorize when there is a consistant plan in place for what the colors visually symbolize. Finally, color in the Name First then repeat the names while coloring in that particular portion of the diagram. . I also underline the names on the left page the same as the diagram color - just makes it faster to locate if I want to look for something later...not necessary, but nice.

{"review": "Jonas lives in a \"perfect\" world where war, disease, and suffering have all been eradicated. Everything is in order; everything is under control. The people have no worries or cares. The Community strives for \"sameness,\" in which everyone and everything are the same and equal. To help the Community function as a cohesive unit, each member is assigned a position in society. When Jonas turns twelve, the Community selects him to be the new \"Receiver of Memories.\" Only the \"Giver\" knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas. The Giver is a wonderful book. Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story. She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this \"perfect world.\" The Community's advisors intend to establish security within utopian society, but they really establish a stifling dystopia. To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life, the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people. In effect, the citizens have no freedom of choice; they do not choose their job or even their spouse. Moreover, the advisors inhibit the people's ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life. For instance, individuals must take a pill everyday, which suppresses passionate feelings. The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love. One of the goals of the Community is to achieve \"sameness\" so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different. However, this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image. Finally, to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past, the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world (also known as \"Elsewhere) and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society: the \"Receiver.\" Therefore, the Community lives only in the present, and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life. They are naive; they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories. While receiving the memories, Jonas learns a different and better way to live and realizes what he and the Community have been missing. He decides that something must be done to change the current conditions and enlighten his community. Although it is a Newbery Award Winner, The Giver is a controversial book that has been challenged and even banned. After parents complained that the violent and sexual passages were inappropriate for children, the Bonita Unified School District in California temporarily banned the novel from classes. The Giver has been challenged in other school districts around the country for its \"mature themes\" of euthanasia, infanticide, and suicide. I do not agree with banning and challenging of this novel. It is a great book, and part of what makes it so great is the incorporation of these controversial issues. They force readers to wrestle with their own thoughts and figure out their stance on the issues. Good literature makes readers think. Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore. The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state. A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time. I love this book, and I encourage everyone to read it.", "id": "8975347011"}
{"review": "Jonas, an Eleven when THE GIVER opens, lives in a Community where everything is meticulously ordered: houses look alike, people dress alike, each family unit includes a father and a mother (who can apply for one male and one female child). Children begin their volunteer hours when they are Eights, and the Committee of Elders assigns them their roles in the Community at the Ceremony of Twelves. Because the people have chosen Sameness, nothing in their Community is unexpected, inconvenient, or unusual. They have no hills, no color, no cold, no sunshine. Their feelings are only superficial; their memories encompass only one generation. Pain is relieved instantly by taking a pill. They have abdicated choices. The Receiver of Memory holds the position of highest honor within the Community, serving as the repository for the memories and knowledge of generations. Whenever the Committee of Elders are faced with a new situation, they are able to seek the counsel and advice of the Receiver. They have the benefit of experience without having to bear its pain. Because of his intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and Capacity to See Beyond, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory. The current Receiver, who has held the position for decades, then becomes the Giver. Ms. Lowry paints a vivid picture of this Community. Referring to everyday concepts in a slightly unusual way helps to set that society apart from our own. Babies younger than one year are called \"newchildren,\" for example; children of the same age are \"groupmates\"; the elderly, the unhealthy, or those who have broken the rules three times may be \"released.\" Why might parents or teachers consider THE GIVER inappropriate for their children? I can only speculate on this since I find the book profoundly original and commendable: 1. The setting being a community without freedom. It should be noted, however, that citizens relinquished their freedom years earlier in order to escape the accompanying chaos. They are perfectly satisfied with their arrangement and are not oppressed. 2. The family being depicted as a temporary sociological unit rather than a permanent socio-biological unit. Nevertheless, this family unit provides a very nurturing atmosphere. 3. References to \"Stirrings\" (sexual arousal). These occur only a few times in the book and are only vaguely described. Since Stirrings are forbidden in the Community, young people begin taking a preventative pill upon first experiencing them and continue taking it daily until they enter the House of the Old. 4. The idea of young people bathing the elderly of the opposite gender. This happens only once in the book. It is a gentle, caring, and (given the ages of the participants) asexual experience. 5. The concept of \"release.\" This pervades the book, but its meaning remains uncertain until Chapter 19, when Jonas witnesses a release. I would think that for many readers these concerns would be assuaged by Jonas, the young protagonist who, in the course of his instruction, recognizes the advantages of previous systems and selflessly tries to better his Community. Although there are aspects of this Community that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Lowry is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of the characteristics of the Community that disturb us: Do we attempt to make our lives pain free? Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories? Do we use euphemisms? Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies? Do we have anything resembling the \"House of the Old\"? Do we have a ritual that might be called a \"Ceremony of Loss\"? Do we attempt Climate Control? Do we avoid talking about ways in which we differ from each other? In our own Society, without a designated Receiver of Memory, that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Which memories will we receive? Which will we give?", "id": "8975347011"}
{"review": "In a community that is all the same lives Jonas, who discovers he is very different. Jonas is the main character in the book The Giver, my favorite book. I loved The Giver because the plot was very creative, the theme was magnificent, and the setting was vivid. I think you should read this book for many reasons. The theme of this book is clearly represented: freedom, the right to make your own choices, uniqueness, and individuality are worth dying for. In Jonas's community, a commitee selects one's job, war is unheard of, all people wear the same attire, and all are assigned spouses and families. When Jonas is given the special, wonder-filled occupation of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he finds that there is much more to life. Through his task of becoming the Receiver of Memory, he discovers the meaning of love, pain, frustration, color, and cold. That is when Jonas realizes how much more there really is. Life soon becomes overwhelmingly unbearable in his world of \"sameness.\" He finds life isn't worth living without the qualities (often that we take for granted) he discovered. That is when Jonas goes on a dangerous journey to find a land that is different. The setting in this book made it quite a pleasure. Everything in the community was predictable and pre-planned. The housing units were all the same. There were designated spots for everything. The setting helped develop the plot and theme. The mysterious ending leaves one filled with curiousity and wonder. The book, The Giver, by Lois Lowry is guaranteed enjoyment, especially for someone who likes a good theme and plot that ties in with the setting.

I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid? Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things.

{"review": "The Giver is a very suspensful book. It is a great book forall ages. I would reccommend The Giver to be put on a requiredreading list. It will intrigue you from the very first page to thevery last. The author did a great job keeping the reader interested throughout the whole book. The Giver is about a boy named Joanes. He lives in an ideal world. There is no pain, no worries, and no memories. Each person is assigned a certain role and that role is carefully chosen and well thoughtout . Each member in the community has to work in that job until they enter the house of the dead. When Joanes is twelve years old he is assigned the most important role in the community. This role requires power, strength, and courage. This job also requires pain, and emotional feelings Joanes may not be ready for. When Joanes receives his training the world in his eyes is now seen in a different perspective. His world is no longer a perfect world. Joanes now realizes all the things and choices he is misssing out on. This explores human's desire to live life to the fullest whether there are good things like pleasure and happiness or bad memories like war, hate and death. Joanes realizes he is no longer happy and decides to do something very drastic. This decision could deeply impact the society Joanes lives in. After reading this book it made me think in an entirely different way. I realized that even though I do not get to do whatever I want, I still have the freedom to make choices, and ultimately I can choose my own path. It helped me appreciate my world for what it is, and realize that in order to feel true happiness, sometimes it is necessary, as happened with Joanes, to feel pain, sadness, worry, and uncertainty. This book is the first book I have read that touched me to this extent. I hope many other people read this and get to experience what I have experienced.", "id": "8975347011"}

{"review": "Imagine that you are in your late seventies, and - although you had a rich career as an English teacher - you have only a superficial concept of what the Newbery Medal is, probably because most of your teaching experience has involved senior high school students. Your son, himself a teacher of sixth graders, is discussing THE GIVER with you, sharing the enthusiasm of both him and his students for the novel. In order to introduce you to his world of children's literature, he orders a copy for you. Your daughter reinforces his sentiments, going so far as to lay claim that she and her family (all discriminating readers) thoroughly enjoyed the novel. Amazon downloads your Kindle copy. You are intrigued by the countless memories of a lifetime carved in the face of the old bearded man on the cover. You begin to read. Having recently joined an audio book club, you realize instantly that this is a book better appreciated through a visual absorption. Some common words are capitalized, for example, and this distinction would be lost in a narrator's presentation. Also, as language itself is extremely important in the book's community - the children always being corrected if they do not use the most accurate words possible - the typography (ellipses and italics come to mind) is crucial, and a case can be made for the value of visual as opposed to aural. It's a slow start. The unidentified aircraft seems out of place in the December sky, and it quickly loses significance as part of the necessary exposition. As the characters, and environmental, sociological, cultural, and governmental functions are revealed, you wonder when the action begins. Too many bicycles neatly placed in their designated ports, too much repetition, so many meals eaten at precise times with no mention of what is being eaten, endless references to routine and sameness, and always community, community, community. A disturbing sense of ennui skitters across your mind. Why all the accolades for THE GIVER? Continue imagining that you are committed to completing the book for the sake of respecting your children, although it does occur to you that father, children, and grandchildren are not on the same page ... or even in the same book. On and on it trudges. No chapter titles - just a red 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ... Seven, or the end of seven to be more word explicit, is where the action begins. The author suddenly jolts you into the so-called \"rising action.\" Finally it has begun, and - in spite of your age - you are pulled into the world of children's literature and a darned good story about an age of dystopia. You run a literary marathon and finish the rest of the book without stopping. Your son said it would be like this, and it's nice that you continue to respect his intelligence, but you're not too certain of the reliability of your own. You really didn't give Lois Lowry or her book or her talent a chance. To be fair, you should have reread the first few chapters before continuing. But something's not right. You liked the book, and were caught up in the terrible truths of the community, and were right there with Jonas and little Gabe through the final chapters. Yet a certain satisfaction is missing. You almost feel like saying, \"So? It was good, but I've read better books.\" Imagine then the memory of a bruised ego. You're a retired teacher, for crying out loud ... sort of a Giver yourself. To save what you can of self-respect and stave off complete humiliation (your son said, \"Can't wait to talk about it!\"), you do a computer search, checking out Wikipedia and a few good book review sites. And you make sure that your paucity of the Newbery Award is rectified. You even reread the opening chapters, which, of course, at this point changes your entire perception of the novel. THE GIVER deserves the Newbery, and probably more, if for no other reason than the claim that its underlying theme - the giving and receiving of love- is the key to finding true happiness in this life. Even though the book burners have managed to establish this book as inappropriate for young readers (according to the American Library Association's list of the most \"challenged\" books of the 1990s), THE GIVER continues to remain on countless other lists - those of middle school suggested reading titles. The book is taught even in higher level grades. Maybe it's good to stay in your own community and be happy in your own ignorance... sometimes. But just imagine if ...", "id": "8975347011"}

Jonas makes me think more, though this is a reach, more about the freedom of choice, for in the Community, there is none. The book striked as a powerful reminder that there is not a better world than that the one we live in, for there would be no happieness if it were the same as the Community, and no feelings. Without feelings, we are not human, and the people in this book scared me that some day there really may be a place that comes around here or in some other life where there are no feelings, color, or, most importantly, love.

People always tokd me it was good, but for some reason I never actaully read it until this year. I'm glad I did read it because it's fascinating. It was written for young adult readers (my sister read it in her 8th grade class), but I suggest it for people of all ages because it is entertaining and thought provoking. The book is set in a community where everyone goes through the same routines, and feels no emotions. The main character is a young, teenage boy. The boy is chosen to be the next Giver (you'll have to read the book to find out what that means) which is when the reader becomes more aware of the restrictive communtity that the boy lives in. The book has a fast paced plot, but is not a thriller. It isn't a mystery either, but the reader is given information bit by bit until they realize the dull, restrictive the boy used to lead. I think the book has an underlying commentary about the importance of history in a societym and the dangers of extreme comformity. It's an interesting, quick read for adults, and fast paced and entertaining enough for younger children. I think anyone who hasn't read this yet should definitely give it a try.", "id": "8975347011"}

Since working with a tutor doesn't work for everyone, I'm always on the lookout for resources to recommend to people who don't end up working with me. This latest GRE guide from Kaplan is of poor quality compared to its competition and I recommend that you avoid it. There are a few things I like about the guide: - the essay advice section has extensive drills on how to improve your writing. - the answer explanations are well-thought out and detailed - there is a lot of material to practice with, both in the book and online However, the flaws of this book outweigh the benefits, in my view: - practice question quality is average. Questions are less complex and generally easier than real GRE questions. - the book has no logic questions other than the \"two bolded parts of a passage\" questions. This is an egregious omission, since the real GRE will have 1-3 of this type of question per section! (Strangely, the online practice tests DO have logic questions - would be nice if the book had covered them so you'd have strategy for them.) - coverage of most topics is cursory and not good enough for mastery or even basic competency in many cases - Kaplan strategies will work pretty well on Kaplan-written questions, but aren't nuanced or robust enough to handle many real GRE questions The fact that this is the #1 selling GRE book confounds me - I assume it's partly due to Kaplan's multi-million dollar marketing machine (and some seriously dubious 5-star reviews - check 'em out yourself). If you're looking for a recommendation, Manhattan Prep writes the best GRE books on the market.

If, like me, you have not kept up a working knowledge of geometry, probability/statistics, harder algebra, etc., I dare say it will definitely not help you learn or master the important concepts. You will need to read something else (or find a good class/tutor) to start to learn or remember how to approach certain types of problems. I found the Princeton Review guide of a few years ago (2012 I believe) much more insightful in its explanations of the different types of quantitative problems.

{"review": "I've been tutoring the GRE since 2008, I've taken the Revised GRE, and I've written two preparation books for it (Barron's 6 GRE Practice Tests, and GRE Vocab Capacity). So I'm very familiar with the test (maybe a little too familiar). This version of the ETS Official Guide to the Revised GRE is exactly the same as the old version except for a couple of important things: 1. There's a new paper practice test. This is great, since it brings the number of authentic GRE practice tests available to four. 2. Sample responses to the 2nd paper test's essays are included with grader commentary. This is useful since you can see what the real graders liked and what they didn't. Things I like about this book: 1. The AWA (analytical writing assessment) chapter is well-written. Not only does it clearly explain how to score well, but it includes real sample essays (and there are more sample essays + commentary at the end of each paper test). 2. The book and CD have real GRE questions and tests (obviously). Using real questions is much more valuable that using those written by a third party because they are always more realistic and therefore are MUCH better preparation for the real GRE you're going to take. The computer tests are exactly like the real GRE I took. 3. The book covers all question types and *almost* all of the math concepts. Things I don't like: 1. The question explanations are often inaccessible to the average student, too technical/highfalutin, or too presumptive that the student understands certain concepts. I realize that the book can't explain everything, but more question explanations could be written in layman's terms. Similarly, the math review goes into too much detail about certain concepts and skimps or even leaves out others. 2. The strategies in the book are not very insightful. Any good tutor or test-prep book can offer more helpful strategies than this book - but I guess we shouldn't expect ETS to give us the best tips on its own test - just like we shouldn't expect the IRS to tell us how to save the most money on our taxes. The practice tests on the CD are the same ones you can download from the GRE website for free. Overall, this book is essential to prepare for the new GRE, and your time spent with it will pay off. Even if you think you're very good at math, verbal, and/or writing, mastering the GRE demands getting used to its format, quirks, and nuances. Do not let third-party material (Kaplan, Magoosh, etc.) give you a false sense of confidence! If you're interested in my help, you can get in touch with me through my profile.", "id": "8975347011"}
{"review": "As many other reviewers have noted, this is the only book on the market that is produced by ETS, the company that writes and administers the GRE; however, please know that this does not mean that buying this book is a no-brainer. Far from it. The book may be helpful to you in some respects, but I would never recommend purchasing only it to study for the GRE. I would buy it perhaps as a supplement to a book published by a third-party (like Barron's, the Princeton Review, Kaplan, etc) or not at all. These third party books really are likely to serve you FAR better, as I will try to explain. Here are the things I think you should consider as you decide whether to purchase this book: 1) The majority of the practice questions in this book are available for FREE on the ETS website. Just check out their \"Prepare for the GRE\" page for pdfs. 2) The POWERPREP II software (including two practice tests) which is contained on the disc accompanying this book is also available for FREE on the ETS website. Just check out their \"Prepare for the GRE\" page for a download. 3) Whether you go with the book or get it online, the POWERPREP II software is Windows/IE-compatible only. (Ridiculous.) 4) The Math Review section of this book is also available for FREE on the ETS website. Just check out their \"Prepare for the GRE\" page for a download. 5) Many of the other explanations and general tips contained in the book are also included in the free online materials (I think it's called the Practice Book) on the ETS website. 6) All that said, if you prefer to work on paper rather than on a PDF, and you don't want to print out a giant stack of pages, you may like the idea of having ETS' materials nicely printed and bound as they are in this book. 7) One nice thing about the fact that this book was written by ETS is that you get actual old GRE questions. ETS doesn't license its old questions, so all other books will have questions meant to closely approximate authentic GRE questions, but which never actually appeared on a GRE exam. However, since you can get most of these ETS-authentic practice questions for free, as I've explained, you still may not want to spend on this book. Plus, the questions that third-parties write are, for the most part, similar enough to real GRE questions to still be very good practice. 8) The down side (and I think you should think about this carefully) to this being written by ETS is that it, naturally, sells the \"ETS-Kool-Aid\" - HARD. What I mean is that other third-parties will shoot you straight because they are not invested in promoting the mystique of this exam. They will tell you, for example, the true fact that the GRE really measures your ability to do well on the GRE, whereas ETS' book will claim, as ETS of course must, that the GRE is predictive of your success in graduate school. In addition, third-party books will level with you about how the GRE is written and how it is graded and will teach you tips, tricks, techniques, and work-arounds for the GRE. ETS has to take itself and its exam very, very seriously, which is likely to just scare you and stress you out. Third-parties will level with you. (See also the next point.) 9) (This is to some degree an extension of the previous point.) The Math Review that the ETS has written (recall it is also available for free online) is very misleading in some ways. Firstly, it can be confusingly-presented for those dusting off old, unused math skills. Third-party prep books will serve you far better in explaining these concepts simply, although if you need help with very basic concepts (like long division), you may want to supplement with something like Princeton Review's Math Smart I (or maybe check out tutorials online if you want to save money). Secondly, there are some math topics covered by ETS in their materials that you are simply very unlikely to see on the actual GRE; seeing them in this book will just make you anxious. You do not need to master all the math ETS gives you in this book in order to get a great score on the math portion of the GRE (after all, you can still score in the 99th percentile of test-takers even if you get a few questions wrong on the test). ETS will make it sound like you must know inside and out all the math they give you in this book, but third-party books will be much more honest with you about which concepts you actually need to master, what short-hand tips and tricks you can use, what things you may just want to memorize outright, and what minimum understandings you can totally get by with on some of the trickier math topics that might come up on the GRE. 10) Only third-party books give you actual lists of vocab words that are the most likely to appear on the GRE. This book does not. These lists are very useful in studying for the GRE. Some final thoughts. No book will guarantee you an awesome score on an exam. I suspect many poor reviews of various test-prep books on Amazon are likely just sour grapes. The truth, in my opinion, is that major third-party prep books are probably roughly equivalent in getting you familiar with, giving you good tips for, and getting you some practice on GRE questions. You have enough to worry about without stressing over which book to choose! Just pick up one of the major third-party books and let it be your primary study guide. Get this book, if at all, only as a supplement.", "id": "8975347011"}
{"review": "To make this review short I will just say that if you are an individual such as myself, who has struggled with math since grade school and are now trying to learn enough math to get a humble score on the GRE this is not the book you should be purchasing. This book assumes that you already have a decent understanding of mathematical concepts in Geometry, Algebra, and Statistics. For those of us who are majoring in social sciences or another non math related field this book will feel like it is skimming through weeks worth of math concepts on every single page. I found it to be utterly impossible to understand many of the ideas presented in the book due to the cluttering of these concepts and marginal explanation of how they work together. I found the Princeton Review book to be much more organized and easy to follow due to my severe math deficiencies. The Princeton review does not attempt to teach you 3 years of math by giving you a extremely condensed and limited version of concepts that you barely understood the first time around. Instead its focus is on helping you simply get through the GRE. This book does not even allow you to look at the answer choices in the practice problems as A,B,C,D,E as you would have them on the GRE so it forces you to do the problems their way without actually providing you with enough explanation to understand those problems in the first place. The Princeton review embraces the idea of turning a hard algebra problem into a simple arithmetic problem by plugging in, this book does not even mention this invaluable strategy! Nor does it let you apply it because as stated previously, it does not provide you with A,B,C,D,E answer choices! If you are someone who has done well in math in the past and just need a refresher for the GRE I recommend this book for you however, if you are like myself, an individual who has struggled with math since elementary school, avidly avoided math in college, and are now trying to pursue a graduate education in your (non math related) field then I would highly advice you to look into both the Princeton review and the GRE for Dummies 7th Edition books.

{"review": "As you likely know from either the title or familiarity with the ETS, this book is the Official Guide for the GRE General Test (Revised). I teach the GRE full-time and this is one of two books I require my students to purchase for two primary reasons. This is the only book made by the test-makers, so there is an extraordinarily amount of useful information here: the questions are phrased in the way that the real test phrases them, the content is fairly reflective of the real exam, and the book itself now comes with 2 paper-based and 2 computer-based versions of the test. So, in total, there are hundreds of questions to try your hand at. Secondly, each question comes with a very lengthy explanation as to why certain answers are right and often enough, why other answers are wrong. The ETS is also kind enough to identify which questions are of what difficulty level, so you can even mark your own progress fairly well, too. The book further comes with examples of responses to the Analytical Writing tasks, so you have a very good sense of what the ETS thinks of as \"a good essay\" and \"a bad essay\", as well. The book is, however, fairly lacking on a number of other counts. It is not particularly useful as a stand-alone text and once you've exhausted the questions in the book, there are no other resources to use outside of it from the ETS. Additionally--and most importantly--the book lacks a functionally useful set of questions to really build on basic mathematics skills and takes for granted that test-takers will be able to perform particular operations. My biggest gripe about the book is it's Quantitative Review (Pages 207-305), in which there are no explanations for sample problems and often, concepts are covered in ways that are actually almost unusable for the test itself. Bizarrely, in spite of the fact that the test consistently features Special Right Triangles (Pythagorean Triplets) and often requires test-takers to simplify radicals, the book makes no mention of either of these basic math concepts. These are two among many others. Additionally, the test does not often inform students of the most efficient or effective way of working through a problem. They'll give a very accurate description of how to solve math problems in some cases, but not if it's optimal for ideal test-taking. As a prime example, there are right triangle questions featured on almost every version of the GRE and almost all of the right triangles featured have particular properties to them. But, the GRE Guide makes no mention of these properties and test-takers are left to their own devices to either figure them out or work around them in the most inefficient ways. The book is a sort of oddity, as such: it purports to be the Official Guide of the test but it also seems purposefully left incomplete, as if the test-makers wanted to provide some help in making the test accessible, but not so much help that anyone could effectively study for it using their own materials. The cynical conclusion one might draw from this is that the ETS is heavily invested in maintaining the secrecy and mysteriousness of the test (and is also invested in test-takers re-testing) but they don't want the test to seem unduly unfair. To improve this product, they should include more practice sets that are divided up by concept (rather than simply by difficulty) and further, they should revamp the math review, which has not changed since the good ole' days of the original GRE Guide (which was originally published over 20 years ago).", "id": "8975347011"}
{"review": "I bought this book three weeks ago and took the GRE today. I've read complaints that it assumes that you have already learned the math. This is probably true. The GRE is for college graduates and the quantitative reasoning portion tests pretty much everything that any student should have learned in high school. The GRE does not cover trig or calculus. It is not reasonable to expect a 563 page book to actually teach all of the math courses taught in high school. But, assuming that you did take algebra, geometry, and some basic probability; chapter seven is an excellent refresher to bring you up to speed quickly. The chapters on analytical writing are great at showing you what the ETS readers will be looking for. The reviewer that said that there are no explanations for the answers to the practice exams apparently did not look at the 78 pages that followed the answer key. Unlike the Barron's book, the ETS not only explains the correct answer, but also explains why the other distractors are incorrect. I thought the explanations were quite thorough and very helpful. I agree that the computer based version of the test did not provide feedback (if it did, I didn't know where to find it) but I took them after doing the paper tests. These turned out to be EXACTLY like the actual test, and I thought that they were great practice. The grades furnished by the paper and computer-based practice exams were very close to the unofficial scores I received at the end of the actual test.

{"review": "Saunders is the best Review for the NCLEX hands down. I can't personally say that I have tried other books, but I'll start off by saying that I passed the NCLEX. On my first try. With 1 month to study. After being out of nursing school for a year without reviewing. For reasons that are too long to detail here, I was having difficulty scheduling my NCLEX due to various factors. Due to some miscommunication mostly on my part, I found that they had scheduled me to take the NCLEX and had given me a test date which was exactly one month away. You can imagine the overwhelming panic that came over me as I realized I had been out of nursing school since December 2012, and it was now mid-January 2014. Anyone reading this that is thinking of \"taking a break\" from nursing after graduating before preparing for the NCLEX... do not wait a year like I did. This will help prevent a lot of unnecessary stress. The tools I used to review included this book (the Kindle version) which is the 6th edition, and NCSBN's learning extension review for the NCLEX online. Now the reason that I purchased the Kindle version of Saunders was because I had ordered the physical copy of the Saunders 5th Edition book and it was taking much longer than expected to arrive to me. At the time I was living in a small town in Alaska, and Barnes & Noble or was not readily available to me to purchase an NCLEX review book. As I became more and more anxious for the 5th Edition to come in, I could not NOT study and wanted a textbook in addition to the lessons online on NCSBN. I opted to purchase the Kindle edition of this book so that it could be delivered to me right away electronically and I could begin reviewing. I wanted the physical copy of the 5th edition for a reason though. Many reviews online from students expressed that the CD that comes with the 5th edition hard copy was very valuable and the practice questions and lessons on the CD helped other studying students tremendously. That CD was what I was after, to help me review & master the material that I would be going over in the book. I had an issue with the 5th edition not coming with that CD... and other reviewers online had the same concern. But I will clear the air and say to anyone using the CD as a deal breaker between these two editions, the 6th edition may not come with the CD, but it comes with an online membership to a website containing the EXACT SAME MATERIAL found on the physical CD that comes with the 5th Edition! Once I received the 5th Edition in the mail I was able to compare the two, and really, the content on the Saunders review website with the 6th Edition is the same as the content on the CD with the 5th Edition. Even more, the content of the entire book of the 6th Edition is nearly identical to the content within the 5th Edition. The difference between the two texts are unnoticeable besides the fact that the content is reordered in the 6th Edition. The content in these books were incredibly informative. For someone who had not reviewed for a long time, I was able to get back into the swing of things using these texts, and the \"Pyramid Points\" were absolutely KEY to remember. Every chapter was equipped with important, to the point information, highlighting facts & strategies that were imperative to remember. Each chapter then concluded with review questions that were similar to what I was actually tested on. I would also recommend the audio reviews on the CD or review website. Use the testing strategies that are outlined in these books. When I was stumped on a question because I just didn't know the answer from not knowing the content, I was able to use the strategies they taught to narrow down options to find the right answer. When I took the exam I used up the whole time and I answered questions at my own pace. I tried to not feel rushed, and I didn't really utilize the breaks except for once. At the time I took it, I didn't feel completely confident that I passed, but at the same time I knew that I had been prepared well and a lot of the content I was tested on had been covered in my Saunders texts. A couple days later I found out that I passed! What a gratifying feeling, and I do owe it to Saunders mostly, and in part to NCSBN's review, but if I could weight it I would give Saunders 89% of the credit and 11% of it to NCSBN. Bottom line, I would recommend these books, both the 5th and 6th edition, to any nursing student preparing for the NCLEX. If I could pass the NCLEX studying only for 1 month (technically, 3.25 weeks, as I was delayed in starting from waiting for the 5th edition to come in before I began studying with the 6th edition on Kindle), and I had been out of school for over a year, then you definitely can pass using these tools especially if you have a lot more time to study than I did. Hopefully this helps! Good luck to all studying! Regards, Nicole, RN-BSN ;)", "id": "8975347011"}

I had this book, and through my nursing school we were required to take the Kaplan course. I would study this book about 2-3 chapters per day. Then I would switch to Kaplan and do qbank questions about 75 questions per day. When I reviewed Kaplan rationales, I would also look up the topic in Saunders for a more in depth explanation. I repeated this for the next 3 1/2 weeks. What I didn't like was at the end of each chapter were about 5-10 review questions. Don't bother doing these questions as they're not indicative of NCLEX-style and does not assess critical thinking skills but rather test your short term memory. Another bummer was that there is NO CD included with this book but you are given a product key to enter online. Maybe I'm old school/lazy, but I didn't even bother to use it. If I didn't have Kaplan (or if I started studying earlier than I had planned), I would have used it. This book has 95% of the topics that will come up on the NCLEX.

In a nutshell, first the French tried and failed to build a sea level crossing at Panama. This was in pursuit of a vision held by many national leaders in order to cut thousands of miles from the journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. The Americans picked up where the French left off, and after a decade succeeded in creating a crossing using locks and a man-made lake. What McCollough does so well is flesh out the above nutshell. It is a tale that would not be believed if written as fiction. The level of incompetence, misfeasance and malfeasance, wondrously peculiar personalities, engineering failures and brilliance, vision and size astound the reader and underscore how that age relied more upon enthusiasm, idealism and optimism in the pursuit of grand efforts than does our careful and measured era. The French followed the builder of the Suez Canal into the jungles of Panama. Tens of thousands of French families invested their life savings in the stock of a company that had no plans for the actual canal, very little good data of conditions on the isthmus, no idea of the amount of earth required to be removed, and no budget that would pay for the grand adventure. After spending the 1870's and 1880's mired in the jungle, losing tens of thousands (mostly black Caribbean workers -- the people who really built the canal) to disease and accident, raising increasingly more expensive capital in desperate gambles to stay afloat, the French effort collapsed. Shame, ignominy and jail awaited some of the project leaders. Their effort will amaze the reader -- that such an ill-conceived (that's too much of a compliment it wasn't even conceived at all beyond \"we'll dig it -- viva la France!\") undertaking could consume much of the savings of middle class France reminds one of how susceptible people can be to charlatans and swindlers. Into the breach stepped Teddy Roosevelt. This story once again displays the Presidents immense force of personality, drive and integrity. Evidence strongly suggests he made a revolution in Panama to win that then Colombian province away from a country that could not come to terms with the United States on acquiring the rights to dig the canal. He then ensured, through the use of highly skilled and able administrators, that the organization, logistics, financing and authority existed to make what for years stood as the world's largest construction effort. Great credit for the actual building goes to several engineers and their staff -- many US Army engineers. The success also greatly rested on Col. Gorgas and his partially successful efforts to battle disease: yellow fever, malaria and a host of others that had cost upwards of 200 of every thousand the French employed a generation earlier. McCollough brings scores of fascinating personalities to light. He tells of the financial and great political battles that attended all of the stages of the canal effort. The engineering and workings of the canal are simply and clearly laid out. The important efforts to improve sanitation and fight the mosquito borne diseases are succinctly explained. All of these elements are rendered interesting and tightly woven in this very good book.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "\"The Path Between the Seas\" is narrative history at its best - the story of perhaps the greatest engineering feat of modern times. Writing in the clear and lucid style for which he is noted, historian David McCullough traces the creation of the Panama Canal from its earliest inception by the French in 1870, to its completion 44 years later by the United States. McCullough skillfully weaves personalities and events together to create a powerful narrative replete with political intrigue, financial scandal, and triumph over tremendous adversity. The author first acquaints the reader with the leaders of the French attempt to build the canal - Ferdinand de Lesseps and his son, Charles, and Phillippe Bunau-Varilla, among others - and tells of the ultimate failure of their venture, and their disgrace due to financial scandal. McCullough then chronicles the ultimately successful American attempt to build the canal. Here is seen the political intrigue (the U.S. backed Panamanian revolution against Colombia, with the complicity of President Theodore Roosevelt, Secretary of State John Hay, and Bunau-Varilla); the successful war against yellow fever and malaria, led by American doctor William Gorgas; and the organizational and engineering genius of two American Chief Engineers - John Stevens and Colonel George Goethals - which led to the completion of the canal in 1914. \"The Path Between the Seas\" is more than just the story of how the Panama Canal was built; it is a well researched, historically accurate, and at the same time lively and highly entertaining account of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Highly recommended!", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I hold a personal interest in the Canal as I have just visited it and am a direct descendant of Col. David Gaillard one of the American engineers of the Canal, and all everyone in Panama told me was to read Mr. McCullough's account of its creation. As a history major in school, I read many great and many bland histories; this book ranks in as one of the most captivating books I have read, fiction or non-fiction. Even if one does not have any previous interest in the Canal, after the first pages you will become hooked. McCullough writes with such elegant prose and interesting humor, that the story unfolds like a Victorian novel. From the incredible cast of characters (from Ferdinand de Lessups to Teddy Roosevelt), the intrigue, the conspiracies, the romance, the quest for one of Man's greatest achievements explodes into an incredible book that will keep the reader thinking about the Canal for years to come...and will compel the same reader to venture to this tropical country and view the incredible \"8th Wonder of the World\" himself.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Definitely an extremely well-researched and well-written tome but about three-quarters of the book is about the politics and planning prior to the actual building of the canal. If that's what you are looking for, I'm sure you will enjoy it. I was hoping for more discussion of the creation of the canal community and the engineering of the canal and locks. A lot of reading to get to that portion of the book. Additionally, I think the book would have been served better with more maps and diagrams of the canal. Also, keep in mind that the book was written in the mid(?)-70's so the history from the past thirty years is not included. A minor point, I know, but perhaps worth mentioning.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "McCullough is a master of the English language. This was my first non-biography of his and though it was very entertaining, it was not quite as captivating as his John Adams or Truman. The book is divided naturally into the French effort and the American effort, with ample interlocking references. Fleshing out the individual principal characters is McCullough's strong suit, and as always, they seem to come alive in this book. Research is complete and lends just enough detail without becoming too tedious. The book seems to end rather abruptly, but then again that seems to be historically accurate, as much of the fanfare was lost in the European conflict that had erupted just as the Canal was opened. In any case, this is a job well done and a book worth reading.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I found Mr. McCullough's book about the building of the Panama Canal to be well written, extra-well researched, and highly entertaining! I would recommend this book to anyone who truly wants to know what it took to build such an engineering marvel. Having lived in Panama twice and visited on many occasions, I can attest to the fact Mr. McCullough's book is THE SOURCE for accurate information on the canal and it's builders (both French and American efforts). I would also recommend purchasing the NOVA video, which Mr. McCullough narrates, called \"A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama\". He even quotes out of his own book on screen! I've never read a book so intricately and fastidiously researched. MUST READING for the true Canal enthusiast.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "The Panama Canal represents one of the great battles between man and nature and is truly one of the wonders of human achievement, especially when one considers the technology available at the time it was built. The Path Between the Seas chronicles the many difficulties faced, as well as the men and the scientific advances that eventually overcame those challenges. Ultimately this is more of a history lesson than an engineering textbook. While McCullough does an admirable job of describing the massive excavation operations, that is but a small part of what occurred during the 44-year period the book covers. McCullough grants the reader an insider's view of the \"revolution\" that created the independent nation of Panama and paints a vivid picture of what life was like during the construction period. He also brings attention to the individuals who played a major role in the eventual success of the endeavor, from the men who governed the canal zone to the physicians who discovered, and virtually eradicated, the causes of some of the worst tropical diseases of the time. The book includes a number of maps and photographs that help illustrate the narrative. Interestingly, much of the book takes place far from Panama. Shortly after the close of the Civil War the United States and other powers began surveying Central America with an eye towards building a canal there. In a time before satellites or aircraft this proved to be a demanding and deadly undertaking. Despite the relatively short distance across the Isthmus at Panama, this was not the only location considered for a canal. In fact, Panama was widely considered to be the wrong place to build the canal. An abundance of back-room deals and propaganda campaigns had to take place in both France and the United States to turn a Panama canal into a reality. The Path Between the Seas is a well-written book that I would recommend to others with the caveat that this is a long, densely packed book that is likely to appeal primarily to those with a strong interest in history.", "id": "9"}

{"review": "So riveting is David McCullough's account of the construction of the Panama Canal, that it is one of the few works of nonfiction outside of the sciences that I have read twice. He chrnoicles a mesmerizing saga of despair and triumph, starting with Ferdinand de Lesseps disastrous attempt at building a sea level canal through the disease-infested jungles of Panama. The second half covers the American effort at building the Panama Canal, a project as grandiose as developing the atomic bomb or landing men on the moon. McCullough describes the groundbreaking work of Dr. Gorgas' team of doctors and nurses in combatting malaria and yellow fever; their success made possible the canal's eventual completion by U. S. Army engineer George Goethals. While McCullough does a splendid job in providing facts and figures with his graceful prose, he also excels in recounting the lives of many of the prominent figures associated with the Panama Canal's construction. For example, McCullough describes General Goethals' substantial role after the United States' entry into World War I and his subsequent work as the first chief engineer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Indeed, if there is a hero in this saga, it most certainly has to be General Goethals. Along with McCullough's history of the Brooklyn Bridge's construction, this has to rank as one of the most spellbinding tales written about American technological ingenuity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Thanks to Martha Green, whose name fits the concept, for helping all of us rid those testy problems without the use of potentially hazardous products. She opens this very helpful book with the following intro: `Your bedrooms and bathrooms are two of the places in your home where you spend a huge percentage of your time. Whether it's getting a good night's sleep, getting cleaned up for work or getting ready for an outing, these two rooms get used a great deal by you and your family members. Because of their high volume of usage, it is necessary to clean them on a regular basis so germs and bacteria can be kept under control, leaving them smelling fresh and clean.' And once Martha has established her baseline she sets out to inform us that the most popular current cleaning solutions are full of toxins and unhealthy chemicals. And that is why she has so carefully prepared this informed book - Go Green and be cleaner than ever the natural 9and less expensive!) way. She lists the household products - disinfectants, chlorine bleach, ammonia, antibacterials (they contain triclosan - irritants and carcinogens). Toss those and instead welcome in club soda, castile soap, and borax for starters. Martha then goes through room by room as to how to approach cleaning the Green way (pardon the pun, Martha!). She offers recipes for making green solutions (all purpose cleaner polishing recipe, vinegar and oil cleaner) and then informs us how to use them on furniture, mattresses (get out the baking soda), linens (borax and dishwashing liquid +/- lemon juice for whitening, and a terrific use of a combination of lavender essential oil vodka and filtered water used to spray on the sheets to freshen them. Throughout the book she shares with us the way to clean windows and mirrors, wood floors (wood and ceramic), and sinks, tubs, and showers (toilets are cleaned with a mixture of vinegar and baking soda instead of those VERY costly foaming noxious products that don't last long at all). This indispensible book is full of recipes to help the reader arrive at the Pure Green stage of cleanliness. And it is all presented in such a professional and warm way that you feel like it is your best friend giving you up to date advice. Highly recommended for every household.

{"review": "The hot buzzword nowadays is \"green,\" since we're all being urged to adopt greener lifestyles to conserve energy resources and be more environmentally conscious. Author Martha Green is doing her part with her \"Clean and Green\" series of books on natural cleaning in the home. In this book, she tackles bedrooms and bathrooms, two rooms where most people spend a big percentage of their time. Ms. Green states that many of the commercially available cleaning products are not only expensive to buy, they contain toxic substances and harmful chemicals that have health risks. She then presents ways to save money while using cleaning products that don't pose a threat to your health or the environment. In previous books in the series, Ms. Green showed how a number of common, inexpensive household products can be safely used for cleaning, including vinegar, baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, cornstarch, cream of tartar, lemon juice, and table salt. In this book, she adds club soda (carbonated water), castile soap (soap made from vegetable fat rather than animal fats), and borax (a natural mineral also known as sodium borate). The book covers wooden furniture and cabinetry, with tips on cleaning and polishing. The book moves on then to discuss mattresses and how to clean them. Both light cleaning and deep cleaning are covered. For deep cleaning, a steam cleaner is required. Sheets, towels, and bed linens are next, and - surprisingly - vinegar plays a key role here. The book even includes suggestions for cleaning windows and mirrors. Next up are floors, with cleaning methods described for the different types of flooring. One of the toughest cleaning jobs in most homes is the bathroom, with the toilet, sink, tub, and shower presenting a real challenge. The book is quite thorough in its coverage of bedroom and bathroom cleaning products and how to use them. It's a valuable resource for anyone who would like to \"go green\" in their approach to cleaning.", "id": "48"}

{"review": "Warning: This is not light reading. The book is well-written but is not designed as entertainment. If, however, you are concerned about the Internet and potentially where it might go in the near future, or more specifically, how it might wind up controlled, this book will be an interesting and informative read. Important too because communication and information dissemination are vital to the freedom of us all. Columbia University Professor Tim Wu takes us on an in-depth tour of the history of the communication empires of telephone, radio, television, and now the Internet. Wu's analyses and conclusions are both brilliant as well as at times somewhat surprising. Every page gives evidence of Wu's thorough research, careful thinking and insights that went into the writing of this fine work. The internet has become part of the lives of almost everyone, with its freeing and empowering presence; in fact in important ways it has become indispensable. A not-too-surprising worry might be that the federal government may someday try to control it, not so overwhelmingly as does the government of China of course, but the possibility is there. What Wu so sagatiously points out is that that threat of control could just as easily, or actually more easily, come from the private sector, because in fact the existence of the internet and its smooth functioning are dependent, not on the government, but private enterprise. A different kind of monopoly looms ahead of us as a distinct danger, and this present information age presents new policy and regulation challenges. One hopes that the right government officials at the federal level take heed to this awesomely researched book. If you would like to understand more accurately recent decades as well as the present time the huge corporations that have in the past but also could one of these days control the ways and means of communication, by all means give this worthy work a read.

{"review": "Unless you're very young, you have memory of the \"Dark Ages\" of technology. Yes, there was a time before the Internet...even a time before the ancient 14 kbs modem. I know it's hard for us to believe, but you used to have to be there if somebody was calling AND you didn't know who it was until you picked up the phone! The answering machine could have been available in the 1950s, but why didn't they come out until a few decades ago? The book has interesting points on technology cycles, which I'll get into in a moment, but first I'd like to congratulate the author on doing such a great job of giving a background history lesson. The topic helps because the history of information empires is every bit as interesting as the rise of military empires. It's all about strategies, \"bloody\" battles, and luck. It's just the weapons used that differ. Still, most of us have seen even exciting history made boring by poor writing. Mr. Wu keeps things interesting by giving the personal reasons for certain decisions and the circumstances leading to them, not just a bunch of dry dates. Some of the history discussed I was familiar with, but a lot of it was brand new to me. Several ideas presented on the cycles were thought provoking. Most of us are conditioned to immediately think monopoly = bad, but the point of view of the monopolists helps explain why society allowed them to exist. For example, before modern telephone infrastructure existed it almost took a gigantic AT&T to have the drive to force to link up every person to a phone line; while their methods of dealing with opposition were at times abhorrent, they still succeeded in using the monopoly's advantages (economies of scale, no duplication of research by different companies, steady income, etc.) to do a great deal of good. Bell Labs not only researched phone related technologies for the company but also provided resources and advancements in entirely unrelated areas. On the other hand, all was not altruistic. The same advantages that helped it expand and provide service also stifled progress as the monopoly jealously guarded itself against competitors and devoured or squashed possible competitors. They succeeded in connecting nearly everybody for the common good, even rural farms that likely would have been unconnected far longer because of greater costs per user in small population areas. However, those who are old enough will remember when there was only one choice of phone and it was an AT&T phone only. Once AT&T was broken up, we saw tremendous advances in technology and cost benefits to customers. The point being, things aren't purely black and white. The issues of information control and free speech were also fascinating. To me the most interesting was censorship in Hollywood. It's a lesson in unintended consequences. The big studios' very \"monopoly\" allowed them to succumb to rules of conduct that had married couples depicted sleeping in separate beds for years. In that case rules came from the private sector in the form of religious groups threatening boycotts. There too you see a dichotomy. On one hand, the threat was private individuals in a sense voting with their money and what could be more democratic than voting? On the other hand though, people who didn't agree with those rules had their ability to watch uncensored materials taken away from them in the name of somebody else's view of the public good. It's this kind of struggle for balance we see over and over and over again with the advent of new technologies. I love reading about history and watching documentaries. The adage \"History repeats itself.\" is shown to be true time after time. It's funny how we all think we're so unique, doing things for the first time, but looking back (in some form) most everything's been done before. From the phones, to radio, to the Internet, you can see how the cycle of inventor becomes a wide open free-for-all becomes a tightly controlled industry, and eventually is usurped by some new idea from the outside that changes the rules of the game. It's all one big cycle of progress. Now if only I could figure out what the next major cycle will be, I'd be a very rich man...", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The Master Switch is part history, business theory and technology presented in a clear and enjoyable read. This is neither a business book, nor a history book, nor a novel but it has the best elements of all three. Some advice for the reader, be prepared to read a book about business information and technology this is deep, complex, expansive and thoroughly enjoyable. Wu demonstrates throughout the book his ability to research and capture the historical events that led to the world we have today and present them more like James Michener than a dry recitation. The details and descriptions led me to feel like I was reading a historical novel more than a business book. Yet all of the conversation revolves round issues of information, technology and business ownership of it. Wu demonstrates his business thinking through the book and research findings. This is a business book as it discusses how information and new technologies often start out as an explosion of small companies that coalesce into a few dominate firms that then often explode into smaller more innovative companies. Those ideas, the decisions and actions behind them are the context that gives the business history context. The Master Switch is a rare combination of history, theory and technology. People looking to read the book from one of these perspectives will either be delighted or deeply disappointed. As a history, the book is a delight as I learned things I never knew before. As a business book, one with a very clear argument, sequential prose and an explicit `bottom line' this book suffers because it meanders through the history parts. Readers looking for a business book should reset their expectations and get the Master Switch. Reset their expectations from the perspective that rather than loading your brain with `programmed' messages, it may be better to get a broader perspective that will let you think through these critical issues. Setting your expectation to read something enjoyable, informative and comprehensive and you will not be disappointed.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "I have a two-hour wait while my kids take lessons. Right after I received \"The Master Switch\", I took it and a novel to lessons, the idea being that I'd start the former, and when I got bored I would switch to the latter. I never switched. Though \"The Master Switch\" is dense, it's not just well-documented non-fiction it's engagingly written non-fiction. This is the saga of modern information/communication systems, starting with the telegraph & the movie industry, then telephone, AM radio, FM radio, television, cable television and the Internet. Information systems go through what Wu has named \"The Cycle\". They start out competitive free-market with innovations flying, then consolidate (frequently by nefarious methods) into 1-3 major players (monopoly or oligopoly). The big players, frequently with the help of the government, squash upstart innovations and particularly any new system = rival. For example, the U.S. had a \"vibrant decentralized AM marketplace\", which the government literally wrecked in favor of regional monopolies (which became national oligopoly). The title comes from Fred Friendly, CBS News president from 1951 to 1966. In speaking about whether or not there's free speech, Friendly said that you first had to determine \"who controls the master switch\". I find this quote very interesting, because Friendly resigned from CBS when the corporate chiefs decided to run the regularly scheduled episode of \"The Lucy Show\", rather than air the beginning of the U.S. Senate hearings questioning our involvement in the Vietnam War. This isn't mentioned in \"The Master Switch\", but I think it is illustrative of the very point Friendly was making. You can't have free flow of ideas and information if the content is selected by just a few. The chapter on the Internet is open-ended. At this point, it isn't for sure that the Internet will follow The Cycle, and end up with it's content controlled by a very few corporate monoliths. But based on what has happened to prior information systems, we should be watchful. How would you like all your available websites to be picked by a FOX or by an MSNBC? That may seem impossible now, but no one in the 1930's thought there would eventually be only a handful of radio station owners nationwide. Do you remember the 1992 documentary \"The Panama Deception\"? It won the 1993 Oscar for Best Documentary. Do you remember the brouhaha when PBS tried to air it? Nearly whole states were not able to watch it because the monolith corporate cable owners in their areas refused to air it, stating that it was unpatriotic in its implied criticism of the Panama \"war\". (The local PBS stations were forced to show another show in the time slot). Wu doesn't mention \"The Panama Deception\", but he has other illustrations and notes that \"a medium [of communication]... is literally something that comes between the speaker and the potential listeners.... If it becomes the means by which most people inform themselves, it can decisively reduce free speech by becoming ... the arbiter of who gets heard.\" I was particularly struck by two of Wu's themes. First, the methods used by an information company to gain power do not have to be straightforward to succeed. Secondly, government regulation can both promote free market or squelch free market. Take the 1st theme. AT&T, nationwide monopoly, was ordered to allow rivals access to it's switching equipment by renting them space in its buildings. AT&T complied, at rents 5000 times the going rate, and who could afford it? Similarly, Wu proposes that the greatest danger to a continuing free-market Internet is dedicated equipment. If everybody dumps their open-system PC for a closed-system iPad, that means that only Apple's browser would be available and there are lots of ways to block sites that haven't paid the a requisite fee to be available, or at least not easily available, on said browser. I'm not saying it definitely would happen, but how much faith do we put in a corporation INdefintely resisting good old greed when there's quarterly profits to be reported? The second theme concerns the role of the government in promoting free flow of information. President Nixon forced AT&T to allow computer networking/Internet on it's lines, and also required it to accept non-AT&T equipment attachments, such as fax machines.* Similarly, President Clinton required AT&T to allow access to ISP's without deal-killing \"rental charges\". Both of these presidents, a Republican and a Democrat, did their parts to insure that the Internet, as an information system, was free-market. On the other hand, the court of Chief Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, under Republican George W. Bush, gutted the Telecommunications Act, on the assumption that no regulation is good regulation. This is distinctly different from fellow Republicon presidents Nixon and Reagan, who believed in regulation that benefited competition. The Bush administration actually wrote that \"competition didn't necessarily require that there be any extant competitors\"! As I mentioned, this book is a dense read, but it raises questions I didn't know enough to care about. To paraphrase Mr. Wu, the conseqences of allowing an information system to devolve into a monopoly are incalcuable. It's not just possible censorship (whether in the name of ideology or monetary greed), it's the guaranteed lost or delayed (can I use \"squashed\" one more time) innovations. This review is written from the Uncorrected Proof. * Bell Labs, part of AT&T, has many incredible technological breakthroughs to its credit. However, AT&T deliberately squashed or successfully delayed others, such as mobile phones, fax machines, voice mail, speaker phones, packet networking, fiber optics, and very early on, a phone answering machine with magnetic tape. Invented in 1934 by a Bell engineer, management killed it because, according to an internal memo, it would encourage people to not use the telephone! Magnetic tape would be invented (again) in the 1990's by Germans, and imported to the U.S sixty years after an American first invented it!", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The great thing about prophecy is the prophet cannot lose, regardless of his prediction. If his doom-and-gloom prediction comes true, the prophet can rightly say \"I told you so\". If instead, disaster is averted, the prophet can claim his warning put us on the right path. So what to make of Wu's latest tome? After 300 pages of doom-and-gloom leading up to the climax, Wu hedges his bets and makes no prediction either way. He suggests the \"Separations Principle\" as a way to preserve the openness of the Internet but then like a wide receiver going over the middle, pulls his arms in and ducks the ultimate prediction -- does Wu think the Internet will fall to the \"Cycle\" or not? Don't be fooled by Wu's statement \"why the Internet will be different\". A careful reading reveals he's not convinced that it WILL be different, only that it CAN be different, if only the government imposes his \"Separations Principle\". As you know, Wu coined the term \"Net Neutrality\" in the early 2000s. He wrote his book before the FCC's December, 2010 net neutraility decision (which will be appealed as soon as the rules are published in the Federal Register). That should please him. But the last time the FCC ordered net neutrality (in the Comcast decision), the DC Circuit struck down the decision. But I digress. Wu spins an elegant story. But I'm no expert in movies, television, radio, or cable. So it's hard to know just how accurate he is in describing the \"Cycle\" as applied to those industries. But I know a little bit about the history of telephony. If Wu's accuracy (or lack thereof) in his telephone chapters is representative of the book as a whole, I have to doubt some of his conclusions. Take chapter 18 for example (\"The Return of AT&T\"). On page 246, he accuses SBC of a series of nefarious deeds, but one will look in vain in the end-notes for a reference to ANY of them (I'm not saying that SBC is innocent, just that it would be nice to have references so the reader can decide for himself). At the bottom of the page, he cites the Trinko case as an example of the courts allowing the free markets to work at the expense of competition. The Trinko decision says nothing of the sort -- essentially, SCOTUS decided in Trinko that the 1996 Telecommunications Act governed behavior between carriers and that there had been no anti-trust violation. And while the Court didn't cite lack of standing per se, its clear to anyone reading the decision that AT&T, if it were truly harmed by Verizon's behaviour, should have brought the suit, not a customer of AT&T. On p247, Wu cites SBC opposition to the \"line-sharing\" provisions of the '96 Telecom Act. Again Wu gives no reference, so it's hard to know exactly what he means. In the telephone business, the term \"line-sharing\" has a very specific meaning (it means resale or leasing of DSL). If Wu means the telcos opposed leasing their voice lines to competitors, then he is wrong. Incumbent telcos had to do this in order to enter the long-distance business. If instead, Wu is referring to leasing DSL to competitors, he would be correct. But of course, he fails to mention that nothing in the '96 Act requires incumbents to lease DSL to competitors. In a footnote at p247, Wu refers to the FCC eliminating the \"platform\" sharing requirement, at the suggestion of the DC Court. Again, Wu fails to mention that the '96 Act does not require incumbents to lease a \"platform\" to competitors. The Act requires incumbents to lease switching capacity, access lines, and computer systems (\"OSS\"). The Court overruled the FCC and rightly so, but you'd never know it just by reading Wu's account. All this is to say Wu goes to great lengths to paint incumbent telcos and AT&T in the worst possible light to support his theory of the Cycle. Anyone versed in telephone history can see the bias in Wu's presentation. As one not so versed in the history of film, radio, TV and cable, I have to wonder if evidence of Wu's bias is so apparent in other sections of his book. Disclosure: I used to work for SBC and AT&T, but I no longer do (in fact, AT&T/SBC involuntarily \"downsized\" me three years ago so I have no reason to defend them). My opinions are strictly my own and do not reflect the position of any employer, past or present. © Copyright Fred Goodwin, April 17, 2011 americas_team@hotmail.com", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The strongest section of Tim Wu's history of American \"information empires\" is his analysis of the American film industry. If you've ever wondered why the merely boring Heaven's Gate destroyed a Hollywood studio and exiled a major director to the margins of the film industry and the execrably bad Phantom Menace spawned two more films, The Master Switch provides the answer. Heaven's Gate was a standalone work of art that had to make its money at the box office. The Star Wars prequels were essentially branding efforts designed to sell not only theater tickets by toys, trinkets, coffee cups, t-shirts and anything else they could use the film to advertise. Tim Wu's discussion of the film industry and of the kind of media conglomerate created by Steve Ross and best characterized by companies like Viacom and Time Warner is so clear and so elegant, it makes you wish the rest of the book were as good. The weakest section of The Master Switch is, interestingly enough, the last part, Wu's analysis of the Internet and of net neutrality. It's not necessarily bad writing, and it obviously has the disadvantage of covering current events and not history, but it reads too much like a press release for Google. The first half of the book is a solid history of the telecommunications industry. The writing is clear, precise, and never boring. He introduces figures you've probably never heard of, Harry Tuttle, for example, who barely shows up in a Google search and doesn't even seem to have a Wikipedia page. Wu also discusses events that are as important to understanding our history as they are obscure, Western Union's machinations to help Rutherford B. Hayes steal the election from Tilden. All in all, I'd give this book 4.5 stars if I could, but I think it closes out too weak for a fifth star.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "For the last 20 years we have been listening to starry-eyed techno-vangelists insist there has never been anything like the Internet, the Internet changes everything, no force can constrain Internet freedoms... well, if ever you were cynical, even skeptical, about the grandiosity of Internet-era rhetoric, grab Tim Wu's masterful book for comfort and backup. Recounting the history of communications/tech empires since Bell, AT&T and Western Union, Wu ably demonstrates that the \"Internet era\" is traveling a familiar cycle -- one that doesn't bode well for users. Communications technologies have a nagging, predictable habit of exploding all over the landscape in egalitarian Wild West style, but then coming under the control of a monopoly or at most a cartel of oligarchs who maximize profits while foreclosing freedoms and options for the \"user base.\" Thus did the Bell System become a benign monopoly offering the American people reliability instead of options or innovation; this did radio evolve from a woolly pack of hobbyists to a more profitable -- and much duller -- centrally controlled handful of networks; so it went with movies and television; so, contends Wu, it is bound to go with the Internet. Wu's thesis, backed by his colorful 140-year survey of every serious telecommunications boom, is impossible to dismiss. If he is right, and the evolution of the World Wide Web is fated to follow Wu's \"Cycle\" pattern, then net neutrality is, pragmatically, a pipe dream; we can look forward to web content being controlled, suppressed, and tier-priced by a handful of unassailable networks in the same way that your local cable TV supplier controls what channels you receive, or your choice of smartphone dictates what apps you can access. This is the titular \"master switch\" -- a private interest's power to shut down, or at least dictate terms for, a critical communications network with one stroke. When it comes to the Internet we are, Wu makes plain, a lot closer to that state than we think. This brilliant book is part business and economic text, part cultural survey of the information empires of our lifetime, and part warning. It proves two things. One, today's \"information revolution\" has painfully familiar rhythms. Two, we've probably already seen the Internet's free-rein heyday, and can look forward to a future whose terms are dictated by oligarchs such as Fox and Comcast. If the web were all LOLcats and Snooki this would be less worrisome; but as it's become our political, social and economic spinal column in very short order, the prospect of rich, elite private interests controlling... everything... is real and chilling. Wu is an excellent, visionary writer who gives the Internet era what it has long lacked: history, antecedents and perspective. Please read this book and consider the awful consequences of Wu's \"Cycle\" in today's information marketplace.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "Mr. Wu has given us an important angle on business history: how the telephone, motion-pictures, TV network (broadcast and cable), and Internet companies not only created new communications media but how they fought off earlier ones, such as telegraph. The book shows how these companies prospered and came to monopolize their fields. More importantly, we learn how they could stifle innovation as well as create it: the painful experience with early FM radio, for instance, or how the few motion-picture studios could enforce a Decency Code, or the fact that voicemail, modems, fax, private (non-Bell) and the Net itself was possible only after the 1980s breakup of Ma Bell. The \"vertical\" integration of a medium, how, say, the movie studios could dominate not just production but distribution -- individual movie theaters and chains. We learn just how important patents can be, and how difficult it may be for the original inventor to keep control of his invention. The book has immediacy, since Net neutrality is going to be up for review in 2011, and any changes would have major effects on the Net and the economy. Other proponents can tell you how important net-neutrality is now, but this book tells us how, time and again, past communications industries could stifle their competitors and the medium itself. This, above all, is a study of business, not how an innovation can succeed, not even how much money it can make its owners, but just how much power it can create. Strongly recommend. UPDATE, April 2011: Given the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile, which would narrow the major wireless-telephone providers to three, or maybe two, this book is more timely than ever -- especially given the book's fully-told history of the previous AT&T (Ma Bell) monopoly.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "THE MASTER SWITCH is a highly entertaining tour of the history of today's major media industries: telephone, radio, television, motion pictures and the internet. It is also a work of theory, as Wu uses several lenses by which to view the developments in these industries. There is the \"Kronos Effect\" - where dominant companies swallow upstart firms who might grow to be threats; there is \"The Cycle\" - the constant push and pull between open and closed models; and there is \"The Master Switch,\" which Wu demonstrates has been the constant goal of many a mogul and media titan, to centralize the flow of information so that it may be controlled by a single man. (They have all, so far, been men.) The book reads like an extended New Yorker article, with the personalities and drama behind the developments of revolutionary technologies sketched briefly, yet with riveting, compelling detail. Coming from a man who (it is claimed) coined the phrase \"net neutrality,\" I expected there to be more theoretical discussion of what constitutes information control and information freedom. But in the end, Wu mostly allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. The chapter on how Hollywood films were able to be censored for years by a few pious moralists, simply because those censors needed only capture a few choke points, is particularly illuminating. This was not a government intervention, but a self-appointed private group. Wu implies that we need to fear similar interventions in our modern telecommunication systems since today's business leaders, Steve Jobs most definitely included, have designs on consolidating information behind their own Master Switches. It is precisely because so much telephone traffic goes through AT&T's switches, Wu points out, that the US government was able to enact its warrantless wiretapping schemes post-9/11. All in all, this is a fascinating, informative book, well-researched and deftly composed. Highly recommended for folks who liked THE LONG TAIL, THE TIPPING POINT or THE BLACK SWAN.", "id": "3"}
{"review": "The Master Switch is an interesting read on history that many Americans probably do not know. In The Master Switch we learn that while knowledge is power, the ability to distribute information is more powerful. Movie, radio and phone technologies are covered extensively, along with the influences of multiple parties in how those industries developed in the US. These are powerful technologies with the ability to dictate the course of human thought and societies. Those that hold the power can either use it for the public good, or abuse it, but no matter how the power is used, that same power tends to want to perpetuate itself at the expense of innovation. The cycle is simple. A technology takes hold through small steps. Then it is consolidated over time, usually by a corporation, and with infrastructural considerations and support from government. Disruptive innovative technologies are slow to enter the marketplace because the giants are too large and present either huge financial or legal obstacles. Eventually, a disruptive technology cannot be ignored, and the old ways must adapt; just as TV replaced radio as a primary entertainment medium, and the web is slowly eroding many different telecommunication industries. Then the giants slowly embrace and work to control that new medium, consolidating power once again. The Master Switch makes a case for moderate regulation with the input of industry, but not at the expense of neutrality or diversification of power. There are some interesting ideas about net neutrality in this book, but in the end, the devil will be in the details, and it is still questionable if the cycle can be broken. The evolution of Bell Labs, ATT, CBS, NBC, ABC, Apple, the FCC, and google are contrasted and compared. Clearly written and interesting history worth reading and understanding as we at a cross roads of the cycle in regards to the continued evolution of the web.", "id": "3"}

{"review": "Instructions in this textbook are step-by-step and are usually short, and this makes the process to complete each lesson very easy. Lots of pictures--all in color--show you what each finished map or command should look like on the computer screen. Each chapter begins with conceptual information, then instructs you how to do something particular in the program. The layout of the instructions is great. What you actually have to do on the program is bolded and green. Information about the action you just performed comes after in smaller, black text. Each step is numbered. Because you have to keep looking from the book to the computer screen, this design for instructions is genius. You can easily spot where each step is and keep your place, and you don't have to sift through a ton of text to find the next step. If you don't have much experience with computers, you can still learn GIS with this book. Each window, tab, button, toolbar, or tool is clearly described either by its exact place on the screen or by its appearance. Most of the time, there is even a picture of whatever it is in the book, right next to the step, in color. The book may even be excessive or repetitive in this respect, showing or describing to you each time what you need, but never bothered me--quite the opposite, it really helped. This repetitiveness is also true for the steps it takes to complete certain processes. You will be instructed how to complete a process for the first time in one lesson, then in following lessons you may be asked to complete that process again for a different map. Many times after you learn the process for the first time and are asked to repeat this process, there are instructions in case you can't remember how to do it. When this isn't true, the book clearly tells you exactly what process they want you to do, so it is easy to go back and find the instructions. The only thing I dislike about the book and program is that it is so easy to complete the actions without really taking note of what you're doing that you can very easily forget how to do what you just learned by the next lesson. You are taught to do so much in a very short amount of time, and there is no built-in review or \"on-you-own\"-style practice. I think a review or a practice at the end of each lesson would be helpful in retention by making you think critically and reinforcing the steps and processes in your mind. At my school this course is required as a core class of the geography program. GIS is a very important system for geographers to know nowadays, (as well as professionals in many other fields). That being said, I had no interest towards this class or program and found it boring. But I cannot criticize the textbook because it makes the class simple and as painless as possible. The book is of course dull, but only because it is an instruction course for a computer program. It couldn't possibly be interesting.

'Understanding the Concepts' does just what it says, it tests your understanding of the concepts covered in the chapter. Then you have an additional list of questions and problems. If you do every single problem and question you come across in every Chapter, by the end, you not only know the information but you understand it. Love, love, love this book.

Cooper's an interesting character in an over-the-top military style thriller. Definitely a bit of an all-action hero with the physical prowess and durability of a tank, he's also got a touch of humour about him that somehow makes him slightly less hard-boiled than you'd expect. It did, however, leave this reader with a sneaking suspicion that there could be more than just Cooper's tongue firmly planted in his cheek. The scenario that STANDOFF puts him in is straight out of the wild ride handbook. Very very wild. Towards the end, positively lunatic. Oddly believable for a hefty portion of the plot, with only a couple of points at which the reader might be forgiven a slight sneaking doubt, particularly when it comes to motivation. Although that's really isn't all bad for this style of book. Of course the violence is extreme, and the mayhem pretty full on. But back to the plot. Which is nicely evil to start off with, with the baddies very bad, and slightly mad; and the good guys very mad, and only sometimes bad. There's lots of twisting and turning, and some evil women who were, and then weren't, there just as sex symbols, and a reason for all the mayhem which was... well madder than most of the mad thriller type scenarios. Which makes it all a bit hard to put into any context. On the one hand I really liked Vin Cooper. On the other I've no idea if STANDOFF's slightly weird plot is typical.

David had always pushed the limit to which you'd need to attain in order to get the suspension of disbelief right, especially in Ghost Watch and Warlord, but Standoff is just f****d up stupid, really.. CIA threatens OSI into a non sanctioned black bag..wtf is this nonsense..and then there's the most gruesome gore detail on just about every page - why would you find enjoyment in describing scenes of almost animalistic, mindless, absurdly grotesque, disgusting, Tarrantino-esque violence which do not add any value to the story.. sick! You'd expect something like that from a $2.99 per book trash writers who flood amazon these days with garbage but not from Rollins..so, something had to have happened to him because this story is not even close to the quality of the first three in the series, there is no unique narrative style that made the series stand out, it's broken, absolutely no damn good.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "With this author, my expectations were high and I was disappointed by this book. There was too much emphasis on action, bloodshed and an absolute disregard for human life which may be typical of the drug scene on the Mexico/US border but the story line around it was weak. I would happily recommend David's other books to anybody who enjoys a good read but they should give this one a miss unless they are fans of 'blood and guts' stories.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Vin Cooper returns! This is a thrilling and exciting novel from an action author who is clearly at the top of his game. OSI Agent Cooper is investigating an airman who has gone AWOL when he winds up caught up in another investigation - that of an airport massacre. The trail leads to Juarez, and Cooper winds up betrayed, set up and behind enemy lines, facing off against some of the most dangerous people on the planet. This is an excellent instalment in the Vin Cooper series, it's action-packed and keeps up the momentum until the final pages.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "Vin Cooper's latest adventure is high on excitement, suspense and Rollins' quick, laugh out loud humor. I never cease to be impressed by the accuracy of his military references; he must have a wired-in veteran proof read his text for each work. The story this time has its classic villains (two), and you end up severely hating them by book's end. You want to see them go down, in a big way! Vin underplays how keen he is, touring crime scenes and seeing things others before him have missed. A la Columbo/Peter Falk, most dismiss him to their extreme disadvantage, and he gets them. A great read. Thank God for Kindle editions; books from \"down under\" can be pricey for us Yanks. Take advantage of the very reasonable cost of this one, and be prepared to stay up very late with your Kindle on your lap.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "I have all the Vin Cooper novels by David Rollins, and remain a die-hard fan. Cooper is a larrikin hero, who has never let his readers down. His similarities to the great protagonists of Nelson-De-Mille, are once-again apparent in this enthralling novel, STANDOFF. All the Vin Cooper novels are a fantastic read that will absorb you, make you laugh, and deliver some good old-fashioned action (non-stop usually!). My only surprise is that more of this series, have not yet been made into motion pictures. My only complaint is that they are so engaging, you can't put them down, and the ride is over all too soon! Congratulations Mr Rollins on another wonderful book. Please keep them coming.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Another exciting thriller with Vin Cooper fighting the Mexican drug cartels. Author David Rollins has done some good research, even visiting El Paso, Texas and talking to border protection officials. He made one small mistake though, describing Chihuahua as a 'province', whereas it is one of the 31 states of Mexico. Some of the encounters with the drug cartel goons are very graphic, and you may not want to be eating a ham sandwich while reading about smashed kneecaps, faces being smashed in, pools of blood and so on ! It would seem to be an ongoing and never ending war for the US authorities on the Mexican border.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Rollins is one of the authors I really look for. He is an Australian. Oddly, this book is set in Mexico and at the border. It has the action and gore you expect. Vin must be a master actor to worm his way into something as closely held as a Mexican cartel. His leaving Mexico is way over the top! David does a lot of research to support his works. I enjoyed this book a lot and I'm looking forward to his next work. Amen to 2014 being a better year for him than 2013 was.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "An interesting plot with plenty of twists and turns; villains that you love to hate; a great protagonist; and, most of all, lots of action. It's been a while since the last Vin Cooper outing and worth the wait. However, I hope we don't have to wait as long for the next one!

{"review": "I recently read an article comparing detectives to ancient shamans, the people who could see how things truly worked and interpret them for those of us without the gift ([...] This seems an entirely appropriate calling for Jake Samson, protagonist of Shelly Singer's Samson's Deal, the first in her PI series. Hopefully the rest of the series will come along on Kindle. Jake Samson is an ex cop and an unlicensed investigator who seems, in this first book, to fall into a job through an old girl friend. He's middling - age, fortune, prowess, and, according to his own testimony, intelligence - but he has an intuitive gift and a gifted sidekick in a kickass female carpenter named Rosie who is handy with a two by four. The novel is pure pleasure, dealing with the late 70s or early 80s obverse of 60s left-wing radicals, that is, the current rash of rightwing nuts that have made such a resurgence lately. Which makes the novel quite timely. Descriptions, though: Berkeley and Oakland at a particular time. You don't have to have been there to appreciate the bars, the growth centers, the cantilevered houses on the hills, the seedy apartment buildings, the burning campus. And the range of characters: mostly women, many of whom, in good private detective fashion, Jake manages to bed. It's all a romp and great fun. Sometimes I had a feeling Jake might know a bit too much about furniture and decor, and then I realized I would probably try to know a little something about pretty much everything if I were tracking down killers. You never know where they come from or what they're up to, and being observant is part of the job description. And like a good gumshoe he likes to drink everything from white wine, to wine spritzers, plenty of beer, and an occasional margarita. Or two. Samson's Deal: he plays poker, he's dabbled in real estate, and he handles difficult situations even when getting beaten up, so he deals with pretty much anything that comes along. And of course he makes a deal with his client. And he has two cats named Tigris and Euphrates. You gotta love a tough guy who picks names like that. No spoilers here. Get this book and read it. It goes down smooth. Like good Scotch.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "This book was okay--a fairly good mystery. Maybe it's just me, but the book started to drag about midway. It seemed to me Jake was more interested in hooking up and drinking than he was in finding the killer. The more I read, the less interested I became. I finished it only because I wanted to know the identity of the killer. I think 3 stars is very generous.", "id": "18"}

And there is much to bemuse Jake in \"too-groovy\" Berkeley, though the neo-Nazis, arson, and murder are all too serious. Samson's Deal is a well-written mystery with well-developed suspects, but it's Jake Samson himself who seals the deal. For all of Jake's romancing, his platonic relationship with his guardian-angel tenant, Rosie, lends Jake the kind, droll humanity which makes the reader want to spend time with him. And then there are his cats, Tigris and Euphrates. What's not to love? A good whodunit, a lovable protagonist, and all set against the vibrant backdrop of Berkeley, California.

Jake runs the gamut from pop meditational ashrams to Neo-Nazi rallies in his dangerous trek to nail the murderer. Shelley Singer has a way with making her characters not only off-beat, but engaging.

{"review": "Okay, five-star reviews are getting overdone, just like standing ovations at concerts. That said, \"The Best Boy Ever Made,\" the latest entry from Rachel Eliason, deserves the designation. Ms. Eliason is one of those authors whose growth as a storyteller is evident with each new addition to her body of work. This story works on so many levels that it is difficult to know where to begin talking about it. The first thing, though, is probably the setting,that rural Midwestern world of 4H and FFA, which Ms. Eliason skillfully reveals to have a less than Norman Rockwellian underside. Set against this background, Ms. Eliason seamlessly weaves together the dramatic and psychological threads that make up life in a small rural community, and deftly juggles themes of friendship, jealousy, paranoia, bigotry, and willful ignorance that a group of young people and their families must contend with. It is a coming of age novel, but more than that, it is a thought provoking, sometimes heart wrenching love story as it explores first the \"best friend\" love of adolescence, which gradually grows into a controversy beset romantic love that divides families and the community. Ms. Eliason pulls all these threads together without dropping a stitch. Throughout the story, the narrative voice occasionally changes tenses from past to present, giving a sense of actually being told this story by someone who lived it, rather than someone who is relating a story about a group of imaginary characters. In other words, it unfolds with a genuine Midwestern voice. \"The Best Boy Ever made is a Terrific read. It is a pretty safe bet that Rachel Eliason will continue to be heard, and will continue to expand her skills as a writer.", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "Woah. Honestly, I haven't been transgender's greatest fan. But Alecia not only did amazing in the debate, she changed my mind. Sam and Alecia were so perfect for each other. Loved how Brit and Alecia became closer and the preggy plot twist. Lots of people are quick to judge when it comes to same sex marriage and transgender. They don't think about the people they talk crap about, feel strongly about that kind of stuff enough to put up with their crap. Wished the book didn't end so quickly though. Also, wish Emma was at the wedding. But over all, if you (like me) can keep an open mind about everybody--you'll read and enjoy this book.", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "I received a copy in exchange of a honest review. I kind of don't know where to start with this book. I think it's best to just start at the beginning. The book opens with this as the first sentence: \"Hi, my name is Alecia Mueller and I will be your narrator for this story.\" I feel like that is such a classic beginner's mistake. The beginning just read like you read a diary of a person or something and it's just such a cliché. And it feel like it doesn't do the story justice (or at least, what it could have been). And things like this continue throughout the story: she keeps talking to you like you are there and what you both could be seeing if you actually were there and the more it happened the more it annoyed me. So as you read, Alecia is the main character of the book, along with Sam who is a Female to Male Transgender. Alecia seems a bit like a twelve year old: her way of thinking and acting comes across as a bit childish. But as the story progressed I think that may also be because her parents treat her like such and because how uneducated they are (so it could be done by the writer because of that, or the character is just not that well thought out of). So yeah, Alecia's parents: total a-holes. They can easily win the worst parents of the year, nope make that decade award. Alecia has a sister who is also kind of an a-hole, but she has some great development throughout the story and there's a little brother who's never really seems there (or he's just not important to the story). Then you got Sam (actually Samantha, but towards the end Samuel). All his life he knew he wasn't really a girl and when he was 17 he decided to really look into options and told his father. His father who is by the way super nice and supportive. So he starts therapy and later on tells his best friend Alecia the truth. Alecia gets really confused, having never been educated by her a-hole parents and school about LGBT. But she accepts, because Sam is her best friend and somewhere she always knew. Not everyone is so supportive though. Alecia's parents ban her from seeing Sam and people at school also aren't that nice. The rest of the story is just really overcoming all of that (and the start of a romance). There are certain points in the story that I feel moves a tad bit fast. A thing that makes it difficult to keep track off is that there also isn't a real transition when the writer moves on. You're reading and all of a sudden you a month later; you just don't see it coming. Also, certain events seem to happen really fast, which makes it seem unreal to me. There is also a couple of times that I noticed there were mistakes in the story. Character's names were mixed up, some facts were wrong (at least from mentioned in other parts of the book) and those are just things I wished attention was paid to it. And can I also just say that the story had a really Degrassi - Adam feel to it? Not sure if you know the show and the character, but I just really felt like it could have been Adam and Becky: they were going through quite the same thing, though Adam had already had most of his transition done. It was an okay book, but I thought it could have been a lot more.", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "This is a young adult book with a transgender theme. But it is much more than that. The main character is not the transgendered boy of the title, but rather a teenage girl, Alecia, from a conservative family. I think that was a brilliant move on the part of the author. Alecia is a stereotypical high schooler. She has a kid sister who tends to the wild side, and parents who seem strict but loving. Other than strongly identifying as a country kid rather than a town kid, she has a normal share of normal teenage problems. And she's not really sure why her best friend, Sam, has been so unhappy lately. But when she discovers that Sam's refusal to be feminine is not just a matter of being a tomboy, she finds herself defending Sam's right to just be Sam. Her struggle to understand pits her against her conservative parents, and against the school system and the town kids (the country kids consider Sam on their side of the country/town divide - one of the things that to me, was a brilliant move by the author). Events come to a head when... I'll leave you to read the rest. It's worth it. This book is not an angst-filled \"no one understands me\" YA book. Instead, we see the protagonist as a normal, slightly rebellious girl, perhaps a little on the sweet and naive side. Initially, she approaches LGBTQ issues as an ally, out of love for her friend, and a desire to understand. And even after Alecia realizes her love for Sam is more than just that of a best friend, she doesn't consider that love to be lesbian; she has fully accepted by that time that Sam is a boy, just one born into a girl's body. It is all very deftly and well done.", "id": "301889"}

{"review": "This is the complete review as it appears <a href=\"http://ianwoodnovellum.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-best-boy-ever-made-by-rachel-eliason.html\">at my blog dedicated to reading, writing (no 'rithmatic!), movies, & TV</a>. Blog reviews often contain links which are not reproduced here, nor will updates or modifications to the blog review be replicated here. Graphic and children's reviews on the blog typically feature two or three images from the book's interior, which are not reproduced here. Note that I don't really do stars. To me a book is either worth reading or it isn't. I can't rate it three-fifths worth reading! The only reason I've relented and started putting stars up there is to credit the good ones, which were being unfairly uncredited. So, all you'll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn't a rating, unfortunately). I rated this book WORTHY! WARNING! MAY CONTAIN UNHIDDEN SPOILERS! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK! (A list of book errata is on my website) This is a novel about a trans-gender person, Sam, who was born technically a girl, but who is actually a boy for all practical purposes. Rachel Eliason is herself trans-gendered (mtf), so she knows what she's writing about. The novel is told in first person by Sam's best friend Alecia. I don't normally do book covers because my blog is all about writing, not selling, and unless they self publish, the writer really has no choice in their cover: they get whatever cover Big Publishing™ deems fit - which is all-too-often an ill-fit at best. In this case (which isn't Big Publishing™), I have to raise an issue that involves some fence-sitting, and it ain't comfortable, let me tell you, but it is country! Maybe this discomfort is appropriate, too, because for far too many people transgendering is an uncomfortable issue, so perhaps the cover artist is smarter than your typical cover designer? Here's the rub: the arm on the left looks very masculine, yet we know that it's supposed to represent a transgender male. It's not that trans (ftm) males can't look masculine for goodness sakes, that's what they are, after all, but the question I have is more subtle than that: is this the best cover design? Do we want to use an actual male, which really betrays the story, because the subject of the story isn't a biological male, but an XX who identifies as a male. Do we want to use a female so the arm looks feminine - which to me betrays the story even more than using a male arm, because the trans character isn't feminine except in a birth sense? Do we try to find a real ftm transgender person to pose? To me, that would have been ideal, and perhaps that was what was actually done here - I don't know - but this cover made me ask questions, so maybe it's not a bad thing the way it is. Maybe the masculine arm is a statement, and not simply eye candy. I do think it's worth some serious thought though, especially in a novel dealing with a topic as important and as misunderstood as this one is. The story takes place in Iowa, where I've actually lived and have never ever felt the need to go back there again! Iowa winters will do that to a person. Here's a song which I dedicated to Iowa, sung to the tune of Do They Know It's Christmas?: It's winter time, and there's some need to be afraid. In Iowa, where ice storms break and blizzards rage, And in this cold and darkness, you can warm a heart with joy: As the topside freezes-up this winter time! But say a prayer: pray for the Iowans At winter time, it's hard, but when you're having sun There's a world outside your window and it's a world of frozen feet Where the heat bills reach a total that's impossible to meet And the only bells that ring there are the icicles of doom Well tonight thank god it's us instead of you! Oh there won't be cold in Africa this winter time That's the greatest gift they'll get: to stay so warm oh-oh where nothing ever snows No blizzards, no ice floes Do they know what it's like to freeze your butt? Here's to you staying warm in Africa Fresh from those freezing tail in Iowa Do you know what it's like to freeze your butt? Heat the world! Heat the world! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here! Heat the world! Let them know it's cold up here!

There are hungry children everywhere. But I digress! The novel is narrated by Alecia, a very sheltered young woman of seventeen, who often comes off as younger than she really is. You can blame this on her life under the iron-yoke of her Catholic parents. They're a pair of the most blinkered people imaginable, but organized religion often does that. By its very nature religion is divisive and intolerant, bifurcating populations into us (the saved, good, people), and them (the sinners who will go to hell). Bring it on, I say. I'd rather be in hell than spend eternity with bigots and pompous holier-than-thou blow-hards, quite frankly. Can you imagine spending eternity with those guys?! Alecia's best friend since forever is Samantha, who insists on \"Sam\" and no substitutes, and who is a tomboy - pretty much since Alecia has known her. Alecia 'gets' Sam, but she cannot understand what it is which has made Sam so distant over the last few months, until Sam finally comes clean with her and tells Alecia that she's not truly a female. She's a male who happens to have been born, unfortunately, in a female body - and she wants to correct that post-haste. This feeling isn't a rarity in nature as Joan Roughgarden reveals in her book Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender and Sexuality in Nature and People, which I highly recommend. Sheltered as she is, Alecia struggles with all of this because she doesn't quite get that there's a big difference between a tomboy, a lesbian, and an XX female who feels in her every cell and neuron that she's an XY boy, has done so for years, and now wants the world to accept it the same way she has done. Alecia is a trooper though, and never once does she lose sight of the importance of friendship and loyalty, a commitment which means supporting her friend in sickness and in health, for better or for worse, as long as they both shall live. Together, they embark upon this journey, and damn the warped parents. Actually damn Alecia's parents, who are completely negative about Sam - quite the opposite of Sam's own parents. In this spirit (the only spirit which matters), Alecia accompanies Sam to a gay bar on teen night. Sam has to go there to satisfy her social worker that she's not merely a confused lesbian - that she really doesn't want to be a girl who loves girls, but a male who loves females. Alecia goes along with her and finds herself - what is that feeling? Jealous? - of the attention Sam gets from out lesbian Emma, who is very much a girl. Alecia has a father and a brother, but these males figure very little into the story. More involved is her mom, and younger sister Brittney, who isn't quite the good Catholic girl that Alecia is. I have to ask, since this family is so Catholic, how come the girls ended-up with names like Alecia and Brittney rather than, say, Esther and Ruth or something Biblical like that. Obviously not all such parents go that route, but it seemed to me that if Mom & dad were so rigid and devout they would be far more likely to chose Biblical names for their children than to choose the ones we get. Maybe that's just me. One thing which seemed weird in this novel, to me, was the use of \"I am\". Despite employing all kinds of other contractions, such as \"I'd\", and \"we've\", there was never an \"I'm\" that I noticed. It struck me as odd, and it made for rather stilted conversation. Other than that, I enjoyed the way this was written. It was perhaps a bit simplistic in places, with very little descriptive prose, but for me it was an easy, comfortable, and compelling read. Once I began, I did not want to put it down, and I want to read more by this writer - perhaps even more about these two characters if a good sequel suggests itself. I normally detest first person PoV novels, but this one seemed perfectly fine. Some writers, a few, a happy few, a band of brothers and sisters, can carry it off, and Rachel Eliason is quite obviously one of these. I think it helped that she had Alecia come right out and embrace this format from the off, introducing herself like we'd just met and she was about to answer some questions for me to clear up some lack of understanding I had! That approach worked for me, and from that point on it seemed normal and ordinary, rather than artifice, so kudos and gratitude for that! I'm not sure that Sam's social worker was entirely appropriate in answering Alecia's questions to the extent that she did, but this was a minor issue. A bigger issue was whether or not Sam would be seeing a social worker or seeing some kind of psychologist or psychiatrist. I don't know, I've never been there, but it seems to me that she would need someone with a bit more academic and medical muscle behind them if she were going to start gender reassignment as a minor. OTOH, as I mentioned, the author is transgendered herself, so I bow to her greater expertise on this topic. Sam had evidently talked a lot about Alecia, and the social worker wasn't exactly blabbing all her secrets. Plus Alecia's motives were pure - she wanted to put herself in the best possible position to support Sam - and perhaps get some reassurance herself. If I had a complaint or two, what would they be? I guess the first would be that while the novel talks a heck of a lot about the significant difference between a lesbian and a transgendered female to male, it never really went into what those differences were. I think it would have benefited from including that as a discussion between Sam and Alecia. And no, that doesn't mean one of them yelling \"Penis!\" and running! I actually worked in the burn center in a hospital where female to male transgendering was performed. It was done in the burn center because they were the experts on cosmetic surgery (in a medical, rather than a purely cosmetic) sense and they had some very skilled doctors and nurses working there, and yes, a penis is an option. Another complaint would be about raising the issue of prejudice against gays and transgendered people while rather hypocritically exhibiting prejudice in other areas! Alecia frequently chanted a refrain championing \"country folk\" over \"city slickers\" - like country was somehow more wholesome and smarter than city folks, who were somehow backward for never having seen a tree or touched a goat. This merely made Alecia seem backward, shallow, bigoted and hypocritical to me. Besides, it isn't the black and white issue Alecia blindly pretends it is. Not everyone lives either deep in the city or way out in the back of beyond. There are very many people (I am one) who live on the fringe between the two. Besides, who would pay the farm subsidies if it were not for the urban taxpayers? Alecia's attitude and her strident spouting of this supposed dichotomy was annoying and uncalled for, and was the most obnoxious thing about her for me. About 42% in, Alecia makes what could be taken as a derogatory comment about vegetarians, too. This was in context of her being country and therefore loving nature and animals - yet she has no problem slaughtering them and eating them wholesale. She doesn't seem to grasp that it consumes massive quantities of grain to feed cattle so people can, in turn, eat the meat. She doesn't know that if meat eaters of the western 'civilized' world gave up maybe a twentieth of their meat consumption it would release enough grain to feed the world's starving populations. To me this made Alecia seem ignorant instead of wise about the world. It made her provincial and way younger than her seventeen years. There were some technical issues with the novel, too, that some serious editing would have cured. One thing which really jumps out is the scarcity of chaptering. Text runs on from one unrelated event to another with little more than a sharp sign (#) to indicate a break, and sometimes not even that. This makes for crude interruptions in reading while the reader tries to figure out if they turned more than one page/swiped more than one screen. A few more chapter breaks to divide-up the narrative would have improved reading flow for me. Having said all of that, this novel was definitely worth reading. Aside from the issues I've raised, it was well-written in a very engaging style, it fearlessly broached sensitive and important topics, and I was one hundred percent on-board with it. If Rachel Eliason is looking for beta readers for future projects, I volunteer right now!", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "This book was amazing. There wasn't one thing I didn't like. It felt so realistic. I will say that I hate reading. In school I never got involved in ready couldn't get into a book. Or maybe I just wasn't sure what I was looking for. This book felt so real. It was so honest on how people really act towards people being different. Which is sad but true. I connected with this book the moment I read the summary. I got the sample and loved the first two chapters that I had to buy it even though I knew I was going to be buying it anyways lol. I felt a connection, mostly because I know how Sam feels. I'm going though the Sam thing only I had to go through school without changing medically. I can't my image but that about all I could do. I had other issues going on which was a distraction of finding out and coming out of who I truely am. My family doesn't accept just kinda does what Alecia's mom is doing, silence and picks fights when she wants about the situation. which I believe and know that makes it worse than talking about it. I don't really have people to talk to about it besides my counselor. I would recommend this book to transgender people and to their friends. It would help them understand a little. I know I have even a better look at it and I'm the one going through the transition. It makes you realize you aren't alone in the world.

{"review": "I didn't like this book. But maybe I misread the classification, I'm going to go back and check. If I was a teenage girl this book might and that's a big might had been ok. The subject matter was very interesting and it could have been a great book had it not been pure fluff. The plot line was good ....and then it got silly and totally unrealistic. I expected such a deep and serious subject to be , well deep. It was superficial at best and the editing was crap. The book is written from a young teens point of view or the authors ridiculous version of what a teen girl thinks like. I have read books from I a teens point of view and it has sounded both deep and realistic, this was written like a teen movie script. I can see this being a subpar movie in the future. If you want an amazing book, from a teens point of view, with LGBT undertones read ; Tell the wolves I'm home by Carol Rifka Brunt, amazing book that will break your heart and heal it all in one novel.

Kudos to the author for a thoughtful, insightful, novel for young people that is easily enjoyed by an older audience. Since I am a member of the older crowd who enjoys coming of age novels, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this book. I especially enjoyed the narrator MC, a young woman whom I could easily identify with. It is never easy to be \"different\". The story accurately depicts the various levels of support and non-support a young person in this situation would go through when announcing their intention to change their assigned gender to their experienced gender in small town, rural America. The secondary characters and their issues were also well depicted. High school and farm life, family life and young love were well drawn by the author.

{"review": "Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better... The Importance of Being Earnest. Regardless, if not for the plot, read it for the experience in exceptional writing.", "id": "17"}

His wish is granted and you should follow the outcome of his life.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "I have long been a fan of Wilde's plays, but have only just gotten around to reading his only novel. As with so much written by Wilde, _The Picture of Dorian Grey_ is eminently quotable, as Grey juxtaposes the life of an aesthete with those of \"proper\" Victorian values. As Wilde puts it, \"Ity is a sad thing ... that Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.\" And so Dorian Grey sells his soul to remain forever young and beautiful, his vices and immoral behavior etched on his portrait rather than his face. I can understand why those giving the book negative reviews were not fond of the language - Wilde writes in a style and at a pace different from the contemporary; given time and patience, though, readers are rewarded not only by a compelling story (as my former company first seargent once put it: \"in your twenties you get the face genetics gave you. By your thirties you have the face of the life you lived\"), but also the biting and razor-wit of one of the greats. To cite Wilde again, \"I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good character, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.\" Sage advice from a master playwrite. _The Picture of Dorian Grey_ is a modern-day morality tale, and a brief, wonderful read. If you struggle with the prose, I urge patience - you will be richly rewarded for it. Highly recommended.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Arguably one of Wilde's best works, and deservingly so. The novel is a constant thriller that leads you through the streets of London on a wild chase yet takes time to stop and smell the roses allowing for some character development. This book was an amazing read, I loved it and its enticing view of a boy who becomes a corrupt man, destroying his opponents, and feeling remorse doing so. Great read, recommended highly.", "id": "17"}

I quite liked the combination of Jesse and Tomas - in the beginning it wasn't all fireworks but there was something special about each of them and they somehow worked together. I didn't quite understand their immediate attraction and why Tomas would put himself out there to bring Jesse into his home, so near his family, particularly his brother with his homophobic attitude. Tomas was a puzzle. I struggled to understand the way he thought about sex and what he deemed was acceptable behaviour. I loved that he was respectful of Jesse and didn't want his actions to demean him, but his ideas seemed a bit odd. Plus he seemed to resolve, what were seemingly deep rooted ideas, pretty quickly. Once they started having sex it was pretty passionate! Other than those minor points, it was an enjoyable story and provided an interesting take on how one man accepts his sexuality with the love of another. I also loved seeing Jesse blossom under Tomas care, become part of the family and bond with his dog. After rejection by his family and losing his home and all his possessions, he definitely deserved his happy ending!", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "Daisy Harris has once again put readers through the emotional wringer with her latest release, From the Ashes, that brings together two completely opposite men struggling to deal with who they are amongst familial and societal pressure. Surrounding this intriguing main couple comes a colorful cast of secondary characters with baggage of their own whose stories I look forward to being told. Take all these facets and you end up with a super steamy story that moves at a sensual pace and resolves in an immensely satisfying way while leaving the door open to return to these appealing yet flawed characters in the future. Jesse is a young man forced to make it on his own after his father throws him out after discovering him with his boyfriend. He's new to living the gay lifestyle and longs to experience everything it offers but still maintains a sense of naïveté and lots of blushing. He's barely making ends meet when a fire destroys his newfound freedom and he's left with only the clothes on his back and an unwanted dog who's as lost as he is. Luckily the protective instincts of firefighter Tomas kick in and what starts out as a short-term fix ends up becoming something longer-lasting and more profound. Jesse is immediately drawn to the strong, caring, and sexy Tomas and can't believe he wants to help him for nothing in return. He enjoys being taken care of and looks forward to the day he can call Tomas his boyfriend and do all the naughty things he's always dreamed about. I enjoyed Jesse's exuberance and agree with the description of him being puppy-like in being desperate to please others. He's comfortable in his own skin but respects the boundaries Tomas needs at first in order to accept his own sexuality. Coming from the stoic family that he does leads to his being hesitant in public displays of affection. He's also cautious in giving his heart to Tomas as he feels like he owes him for so much and doesn't want to confuse affection for appreciation. There are times though that his youthfulness becomes grating as he tends to pout and run when the going gets tough. He expects Tomas to always change to fit his needs but doesn't reciprocate as he handles their relationship as a child does early on as opposed to an adult. It's not until late in the story that I finally feel that they're on an even level which results in an immensely satisfying HEA. Tomas has long known that he was gay though that part of his life is hidden as his family is very old-fashioned and couldn't cope with it, particularly his brother Diego who lays down certain rules in Tomas's sexual dealings with other men that have led to shame and guilt of himself and his partners. This has led to numerous alleyway encounters that have deepened the guilt and shame and almost destroys the relationship he and Jesse have just started. He's immediately drawn to Jesse's kind heart and desperately wants to protect him from hurt. He enjoys being his hero and taking the lead in their sexual encounters. Away from the prying eyes of family and coworkers he freely shows affection towards Jesse, particularly jealousy. It's not until he's threatened with the loss of Jesse's love that he stands up and admits wholeheartedly who he is and who he wants. From start to finish Tomas was a character I truly liked and cared for. I could understand his dilemma in not wanting to disappoint his family and how truly confused his brother made him and applaud how loudly he ultimately stood up for his relationship. I was left with a very heartwarming feeling seeing Tomas's family subtly accept Jesse and finally give him a place to call home. Along with the internal struggles of the main couple we also met a few secondary characters with issues of their own. Jessie's friend Michael has especially been put through the wringer and it has left him bitter and held him back from finding a real relationship. Tomas's friend Rick considers himself a ladies man and never holds back in using sexual slurs. I think he protests too much though and believe that the fiery meeting between him and Michael will lead to something more in the future and I leave it in the capable hands of Ms. Harris to lead these bitter men towards a HEA. From start to finish I found myself fully immersed in the emotional issues of Tomas and Jesse and rooted for their HEA. Their sexual interludes were super HOT and varied but didn't distract from their character's development or the overall emotional impact of the story. Ms. Harris has become one of the authors I can count on for a richly rewarding m/m read and look forward to the next installment of this series.", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "I've read about 15 new releases in books in the last two weeks and this was only one out of all of them that really blew me away. The book description is quite accurate and the only thing I would add is the fact that Jesse and Tomas' relationship is wonderful because they just 'got' each other from day one. It was great to read about such a solid relationship between two very different people. Whatever challenges come up, and there were a lot of them, they face them together and put their relationship first. Their little apartment fixed up in a garage sounded very homey and comfortable. :) All the other characters were well-developed and the story was balanced nicely. Absolutely the best book I have read in a while! If you like this book you might like the manga, \"Little Butterfly\", Little Butterfly: Omnibus Edition (Yaoi) *coff* 'Little Butterfly' is expensive but you can google it and read it online too *coff* You'll want to buy it here then anyway.

{"review": "I didn't dislike From the Ashes, but I didn't have overwhelming feelings of love for it either. I don't have strong feelings about the book in either direction, and the characters didn't leave much of a lasting impression on me. I did find reading it enjoyable, but I promptly forgot most of what I read a day later. Just some thoughts: 1. Closeted characters are kind of like Daisy's theme. It's her thing. But it's never the same experience, and I think she does it well. 2. So, as expected, themes of denial and general closetedness run rampant. 3. Jesse and Thomas fall in lust, and then love, rather speedily. Ok, really speedily. This usually has the unfortunate result of demolishing any chance of me becoming invested in the relationship. 4. Hotness abounds. It's not filled with smexin. BUT when it happens you'll know, because it's SO spicy. 3 Stars", "id": "301889"}

{"review": "Jesse is gay with no real family since they sort of disowned him because of his choice of relationships. The book starts out with Jesse walking up to his apartment building seeing it a blazed with fire fighters extinguishing it. Losing everything that he just started out with on his own was upsetting to him. Thomas is closeted gay. He was one of the fire fighters that was there at the scene of the fire at Jesse's apartment building. Sensing something about Jesse, Thomas jumps up to help. Starting with the landlord's bullmastiff that Jesse takes ownership of when the Animal Control comes. Thomas tells Jesse that he and the Chardonnay (that's the dog's name...) can stay with him but things quickly heat up. Passion is ignited but ...Will Thomas come out on what he is and wants? My thoughts When I read that first line \"He wanted a boyfriend. What he got was a hero.\" in the synopsis and then I read about the dog... My initial thought this should be good... I really like the way the author wrote this book and told the story of this contemporary erotic M/M romance. It is one book that someone can easily get engrossed in and wanting to see what is next in story. There is one downside, I hate being a pain in the... but I noticed some consistency problems (Example in chapter 3 second line - Car when they began the ride in a truck... umm.

{"review": "Sometimes when you lose everything, you find what you've always wanted. Jesse has just lost everything he owned in an apartment fire. He'd saved up and moved out of his parents' disapproving home finally but after only a short time, he's back to zero. Except this time without anywhere to go and a dog he's unexpectedly claimed. Thankfully, hunky firefighter Tomas offers his home to Jesse. With nowhere to go, Jesse accepts and the two immediately click. While they are exploring sex together in new ways for both of them, their relationship isn't quite as smooth sailing. Tomas is in the closet and Jesse is out and proud. The two struggle to find a middle ground. From the Ashes is a nice story with a gentle romance. The two main characters, Tomas and Jesse, are friendly but have a definite attraction. Thus they get sexual pretty quickly, but with Jesse a virgin and Tomas having some sexual hangups, they ease into sex in a really nice progression. It fits with their relationship in general. However, Jesse is out and proud and insists on not hiding either who he is or who he loves. He can't understand Tomas' desire to be in the closet with his family, but eventually comes to recognize how Tomas' family operates. Both men must give a little to get a lot in return and their road has some easy bumps that doesn't upset the balance too much. The characterization is nice and gives both men room to mature and expand. They're not perfect and definitely make mistakes, together and individually, over the course of the story. I had some issues with the way Jesse and Tomas would act, but appreciated that they could actually talk things over instead of assuming and running off, with one exception. I found some of the scenes overly melodramatic, such as the scenes with Jesse's parents. This scene and others, usually those involving the coffee house friend Michael, seem to add very little to the characters or the story. I think the author is setting up the secondary characters to have their own books but I never connected to them so felt these scenes were superfluous. Harris' writing is engaging and easy to read. It has a melodic quality that fits with the characters and their romance. This isn't a hot and heavy read, but more so gentle and quiet as the two men slowly find their way to understanding and love. They certainly fall in love fast but that doesn't mean all problems are solved. It's nice to see that although they love each other too quickly, they still have to learn about each other and make mistakes to actually grow. I enjoyed reading From the Ashes and can recommend it for those readers who like a gentler, sweeter romance. Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews", "id": "301889"}
{"review": "~Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog I was really excited to read FROM THE ASHES. I've liked Daisy Harris work before and then mix that in with firefighters, yeah I couldn't wait. But the story actually wasn't as strong for me as I was expecting. First there's Jesse. He's down on his luck, his apartment burned down. He's a bit too much of a sad case for me. He was a bit too much like a victim and couldn't really take hold of the situation and be better from it. He was lacking strength. Then there's Tomas. Sexy Tomas. He's the firefighter that comes to the rescue. When Jesse has no place to go, he lets him stay with him. But it was just so awkward that he lives right behind his family (big Latino household) and they obviously don't approve of him being gay. I guess this was just a case of personal taste and different expectations. I like my characters with a bit more backbone and less weak. I do still like Daisy Harris' writing, but I think from now I may stick to the awkward college kids of Holsom College. *ARC provided by author", "id": "301889"}

The three volumes are only 40 some pages total. I am also a stickler for details and this author needs to pay a little more attention to detail in order for the scenes to be even slightly believable.

{"review": "Jamie Fuchs Just like a crack dealer, author Jamie Fuchs is giving you the first one for free in her latest series. It's short (23 pages) and far from sweet and tame. It's hedonistic! Her latest series of erotica is going to leave you feeling a bit unsteady and slightly off balance. We suggest you take a seat or be horizontal while reading. Consider this first book a small teaser of bigger things to come. No pun. The first book in her series, is KEPT. It's about beautiful 19 yr old blondie, Casey, who has been listening outside her single handsome neighbor's window, when he has beautiful women every Friday night, since she was 14. Hearing his Dom/Sub after hours lifestyle has only given her steamy images in her head of what could be going on. She'll soon find out first hand... but is it all she was hoping for? This is for mature adults, although giggling is allowed. As we read it in a public space, someone actually asked if we were all right, because we were so flushed. So hopefully you get the idea.

{"review": "NOTE: This is a Free story written for 2014 Love's Landscape Event. The author chooses a letter (see Above) and writes a story. At some time in our lives we have all suffered heartbreak. We have also realised that though this person left us aching it is for the best. That perhaps something was actually missing, but we were content to avoid that part of us we keep hidden so tightly. The heartache can be a release. This is what happened to Chris. He came home from a business trip to find a letter from his lover that he had left. He wasn’t able to eat and threw himself further into his workouts. Greg sees Chris and can tell he is dangerously overexerting himself and losing weight. He offers his help. One day Greg meets Liam and finds out that Liam and Greg are in a relationship but willing to take Chris on and help him through his troubles. This was a very intriguing, emotional yet extremely sexy story. Sara has a way of writing stories of broken men with such a flare, that you are hooked immediately.

I like the way the author portrays a light sub-dom relationship without over powering the story with it.

Who wouldn't love to have someone take us under their loving care and help guide us through the hard times with a loving hand.

{"review": "This book explores what it means to “communicate seductively”, or, to communicate with your audience in such a way that you’re able to persuade them of something, to convince them to do something, or to motivate them to do something. Basically, you’re trying to win someone over with your communication, but I find it interesting that the book points out, this doesn’t mean simply talking to a person. This type of communication also entails listening and empathizing with the other person’s point of view, needs, and feelings. The book goes over the basics of how to communicate in this way, and it does so in very simplified language, so even if you’re not a great public speaker or don’t feel like you have a lot of natural charisma, you can utilize these tips and learn how to be a more seductive communicator in situations at home, at work, and in the public world. In the end, you’re not only able to better speak to people to convey a message, you’ll be a better listener as well.", "id": "10"}

{"review": "I was turned off by why someone bragging about celebrity clients would need to promote a book with so many fake reviews, but I read it anyway, it was free. I have always felt the one size fits all diet didn't make sense, just the differences in food intolerances and weights in my one house make it seem so obviously wrong. This book looks at digestion and chemical imbalances as causes for excess weight. Will it work? I don't know, because all though in Chapter 1 we are told to step away from our maple syrup/cayenne/lemon juice concoctions and just eat real food, in Chapter 3 we need.... supplements. 3 of them, 1 of them only available from 1 source. A quick check says they will cost $116 + whatever shipping is (wasn't entering my address to find out). It wan't real clear how long it would last, but, based off the book quantities, I estimate its a typical 30-45 day supply. I'm not sorry I read the book, it was easy to read, not loaded with errors, but I'm not sure I would rate it worth $10.95, the information is available elsewhere. Ironically, I don't think any of the glowing reviewers have tested this theory either. None of them mentioned the supplements, or an improvement in the condition they are taken to treat, and only 1 of them even mentioned any weight loss at all.", "id": "10"}

After working through this book and absorbing all the information that Tony has provided, I feel like I have a much better understanding of how to help myself, my family and my clients. For years, I fell into the trap of trying different food combinations (i.e. \"diets\", writing meal plans, recommending supplements and ended up getting all-over-the-board results with my clients...nothing consistent). I chalked it up to \"they're just not doing what I'm telling them\". I was wrong! I have all my clients reading this book and they all have seen drastic results in how 'healthy' they feel now. They've lost weight, gotten stronger and have more energy and now they know WHY... they are actually digesting their food. How simple!!! The hardest part is preaching patience but because I have so many success stories now, it's easier to encourage them to keep at it. I have athletes that have made massive strength and performance gains and now have zero injuries (their bodies are truly strong!) and my \"everyday\" client is finally losing that belly fat and feeling better. I know this is more of a \"professional\" review but I cannot recommend this book enough. I also want to give a shout-out to the support group on social media that T.C. Hale has set up to help us all work through questions that come up. How many authors make themselves available like that?? In a world of instant gratification, this book and its methods might drive you crazy at times. But as T.C. says, nothing that happens naturally, happens fast.

At normal font size, it would be just 30-40 pages, actually, which is short for a recipe book. Mind you, trying to fake a higher page number constitutes a lie, which tells you all you need to know about the author. A chunk of the book is used to ask you for your testimonials (another tell-tale Internet marketing sign) and photos of your dishes so they don't have to actually make and photograph them themselves.

Some recipes are a mix of packages and processed goods - while this may make them quick and easy they do not live up to the claim on the front cover re healthy eating. Store bought juices, marinades, mayonnaise, canned fruit, etc contain preservatives and a lot of sugar and salt. The information on health and wellness does not seem to stack up to close scrutiny - Ms Brown should do her research more thoroughly before making claims which cannot be supported by scientific evidence.

Being an avid reader and follower of Robin Sharma (The Monk who Sold his Ferrari), one always wants to develop and sustain all round excellence: mentally, physically, emotionally and of course financially.

{"review": "I have never rowed. I have never read a rowing book that I can remember. If all stories about rowing were written like Daniel Brown's fabulous multi-level biography, I would read every one of them. This is a wonderful account, told with such detail and precision that I sometimes felt as if I were in this tale. Mr. Brown totally sucked me into his adventure. These young men who rowed for the USA in the 1936 Olympics faced huge obstacles. It was the Depression. Many were dirt-poor. They came from a small (then) and nondescript town of Seattle. They could not have had more difficult problems thrown their way. But by taking every sliver of hope, and mixing in superb craftsmanship (from George Pocock), excellent coaching (Al Ulbrickson), and these nine perfectly attuned young men learning together........the result was perfection. This is a true Team sport. I learned that. It is nice to learn something you never knew, but is common knowledge to an entire set of other people. If you want to read a great, true story of success, this will fit the bill in spades.....and you will understand rowing to boot. The research is mostly based on primary resources, including interviews with some members who were still living as the book was pulled together. Family members did supply additional information to make this undertaking feel solid and well thought out. Concepts from Daniel Brown to consider that are mixed into the story to teach all of us: 1) One of the fundamental challenges in rowing is that when any one member of a crew goes into a slump the entire crew goes with him. 2) There are certain laws of physics by which all crew coaches live and die. The speed of a racing shell is determined primarily by two factors: the power produced by the combined strokes of the oars, and the stroke rate, the number of strokes the crew takes each minute. 3) To defeat an adversary who was your equal, maybe even your superior, it wasn't necessarily enough just to give your all from start to finish. You had to master your opponent mentally. When the critical moment in a close race was upon you, you had to know something he did not- that down in your core you still had something in reserve, something you had not yet shown. 4) The things that held them together--trust in one another, mutual respect, humility, fair play, watching out for one another--those were also part of what America meant to all of them. There are other great ideas to ponder in this epic almost 400 page, could-not-put-down story. I am not giving away anything by telling you that they DO win Gold at the 1936 Olympics. It is HOW they did it that is so darn exciting. Even knowing the end result does not diminish this bigger than life adventure. This is a must read, period.", "id": "26"}
{"review": "This is a wonderful and true story about the 1936 University of Washington varsity crew, eight young men who rowed into history. Daniel James Brown writes so well that history becomes personal, the distant past becomes immediate, and the now dead men and women are alive again in the mind of the reader. He describes the sport of rowing in great detail and with accuracy, no mean feat for someone who never rowed. His writing is comparable to David Halberstam, author of The Amateurs, in quality and in scope. In fact, Mr. Brown has surpassed him with this book. The author, who is unfortunate enough to share a name with Dan Brown of DaVinci Code infamy, does a thorough report on the men in the boat, their families, their coaches, the history of the 1930's, and the science of sport. Many of the old luminaries of American rowing are in this story, the good, the bad, and the legendary, including Hiram Conibear, Tom Bolles, Al Ulbrickson and George Pocock. The story of the Pocock racing shell, which was still the best racing boat in the US when I started rowing, is detailed, along with the life story of George Pocock, his personality, and his contributions to Washington crews. At times the author gets a bit over enthusiastic, and comes close to melodrama. Some of the rowing details were overwrought, particularly during the races. He describes the crews as \"furiously hacking at the choppy water...\" That doesn't describe the sport of rowing, except for raw beginners. Nevertheless, I only have minor complaints: it is a well written story. This is a recommended read for anyone who has suffered through a season of rowing. It brought back all the anxiety of fighting for a seat in the boat, the hours of self doubt, the pain of training in bad weather, with bad combinations of rowers, and the joy of getting it right, feeling the boat fly. This is an inspirational story, one that will lift you up, and it is wonderful, not only because Brown is a great writer, but because it is true.", "id": "26"}
{"review": "Based on meticulous research including considerable primary resources and oral narrative, Daniel Brown's story of the University of Washington rowing crew that won gold in the 1936 Olympics, gives an experiential look at the athletes who lacked the amenities, family devotion and corporate sponsorships that today are pretty much viewed as essential for achieving such success. Shaped by the social, economic and political challenges of the Dust Bowl, Depression and the simmering hostilities in Europe, these young men developed the \"harmony, balance and rhythm\" necessary not only to triumph in Berlin but to thrive in life. Knowing nothing about rowing, this book was intellectually and spiritually satisfying. Brown did an excellent job of developing the character of the individuals as well as the society in which they lived. Parallel developments in Europe provided a good counterpoint and context for understanding the complexity of thought and behavior of the time. It also points to the significant role that coaches play in the formation of any athlete and the importance of seeing the whole person vs. some subset of the totality that is who we are. \"And so they passed away, loved and remembered for all that they were ~ not just Olympic oarsmen, but good men, one and all.\"", "id": "26"}
{"review": "Daniel James Brown's \"The Boys in the Boat\" is an outstanding account of nine man crew that captured the gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Like \"Seabiscuit\" this book transcends the subject of \"rowing\". It transports you to another place and time. The story is told through the eyes of Joe Rantz, a remarkable man who overcame much adversity to be sitting in that shell on the Langer See in 1936. So many colorful characters are brought vividly to life, the coach, Al Ulbrickson, the boat maker, George Yeoman Pocock. The writing is suberb. this is a MUST READ!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!", "id": "26"}
{"review": "Wow, what a wonderfully written book. I did not feel like I was reading a book about the past, but that I was in the past watching events happen. The descriptions of the people, places, and times allowed one to experience the events taking place. The descriptions of the characters allowed me get to know who they were, how they got to where they were, and what happened in their early lives that lead them there. This is a book about overcoming obstacles and winning against odds. The sport could have been football, or tennis, or even checkers. The greatness of this book lies not in the sport or people or the times being described, but in the wonderfully done descriptions of the sport, the people, and the times. It is simply excellent writing that allows one to live the history that the author describes. I completely enjoyed reading this book.", "id": "26"}
{"review": "As a lifelong Husky fan, I was excited when I read the synopsis that this was about the 1936 University Of Washington crew. I'd always been more familiar with the eight that won the 1948 World Championship over the USSR crew in Moscow(since the brother of an advisor to my Scout troop had rowed in that crew), but I love tales of \"small-town\" Seattle and the Greatest Generation, so I dove eagerly into it. Trust me, this is not a book simply about rowing, but also is about what the West, the United States, and Europe were going through in the mid-1930's, as Nazi Germany was flexing its muscles. It also touches on class systems in the US and Great Britain. I was immediately strongly reminded of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit: An American Legend and her Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption, and the subjects of both books come up in \"Boys In The Boat\", as both Seabiscuit and Louie Zamperini were running around tracks at this time(and Zamperini was to also compete in Berlin). Some non-fiction books are so well-done that they almost read like novels, which is the case with this book, the Hillenbrands I mentioned, George McGovern's The Great Coalfield War, and Timothy Egan's The Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl. Coincidentally, Egan & Hillenbrand are both cited in this book.(as is the patron saint of Lesser Seattle, Emmett Watson) Although I've seen many races through Seattle's Montlake Cut, I never knew until reading this that crew races were formerly staged over 3 miles(rather than 2000 meters) on Lake Washington(and the Oakland estuary and the Hudson River), or that they ran north of Sand Point all the way to Sheridan Beach, or that viewing trains ran along the course from University Station(?!?)on what is now the Burke-Gilman Trail(the former Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway). I'd never known that the famous shell builder, George Pocock, had won the Thames boatman's race(Doggett's Coat and Badge) before emigrating to Vancouver and Seattle with his brother. I'd known for years(pre-\"House\") that actor Hugh Laurie had rowed for Cambridge, but was unaware that his father had also won his rowing Blue and rowed stroke oar there and on the 1936 England Olympic crew. Actually, Laurie didn't know until he found a medal among his father's socks. The coxswain on the Cambridge and England eight was John Noel Duckworth. When captured by the Japanese, Duckworth objected to his captors' treatment of his fellow prisoners who were wounded and offered that he himself be mistreated. He was a POW at Changi camp in Singapore(think James Clavell & \"King Rat\"), and then was moved to the Siam Railway project(think \"Bridge On The River Kwai\"). We American's aren't the only people with a Greatest Generation. Brown chooses to focus on one member of the UW crew who he happened to become acquainted with, Joe Rantz, and Rantz's childhood, adolescence, and struggles to pay tuition are almost worthy of a single book. Rantz was able to endure his mother's death, being abandoned as a teen by his father & new wife, and muscling a jackhammer(while dangling from ropes)working on the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. Once the UW crew and the Olympic team reaches Germany and Berlin, Brown gives more insights into life in and around mid-1930's Berlin, as well as into the disagreements between Joseph Goebbels and Leni Riefenstahl's. Having seen both Riefenstahl's \"Triumph Of The Will\" and \"Olympia\", this was very interesting. I really can't recommend this book highly enough. While I loved \"Seabiscuit\", I'm not a horse racing fan. With Louie Zamperini's spiritual redemption in \"Unbroken\", I could care less about Billy Graham, but loved the book. As regards \"Boys In The Boat\", while I'm not a huge crew fan(though I'll always root for the Husky Navy), as I said previously, this is not simply about the sport of rowing, but is so much more.", "id": "26"}
{"review": "Nine men working as one, oars feathering and dipping in perfect unison into the silent water, causing barely a ripple on the dark surface as they glide the Husky Clipper with supreme grace between the sea and the stars. This image is one of many indelibly imprinted on my mind from Daniel James Brown's excellent book \"The Boys in the Boat.\" Far more than a sports book, this is a story about life, love, teamwork, perseverance, national pride, and more, impeccably researched and beautifully written by Mr. Brown. \"The Boys in the Boat\" definitely rates as one of the best books I have read this year, and probably the past several years. In the 1920s and 30's rowing was one of the most popular sports in the United States. The sculls of the privileged eastern Ivy League schools ruled the water for years until rivals from California and the University of Washington began to challenge them seriously in the yearly national championships. The eight man scull (nine counting the coxswain) was the premiere rowing event of the time, and California won gold in the event in the 1928 and 1932 Olympic Games. The fall of 1933 saw America and the world in the midst of the Great Depression, and Seattle was still mostly thought of as a backwater. On the University of Washington campus, however, something historic was happening. Coaches Tom Bolles and Al Ulbrickson were beginning to put together what many consider to be the greatest eight-oar crew of all time. Their goal - American victory the 1936 Olympics in Berlin Germany in front of Adolph Hitler and the rising Nazi party elite. Whereas the crews from the traditional eastern powerhouses of the Ivy League were mostly made up of wealthy sons of privilege, the Washington crew was made up of poor boys, true sons of the depression. They had to work off-season jobs as lumberjacks, farmers, shipyard workers and jackhammer operators dangling from cliffs by ropes on the new Grand Coulee Dam project just to (barely) pay for school. The story is told mainly from the perspective of Joe Rantz. Joe is abandoned by his father and his stepmother at an early age to fend for himself. Toughened by years of hard work and hustling just to get by, Joe is finally accepted into the nearby University of Washington where he guts it out to make the rowing team. The team rows in the cold, in rain, in choppy conditions, and even in the ice and snow of the Pacific Northwest. Joe fights for a seat in the boat and over time learns about love, friendship, trust, balance, and how to fly or \"swing\" in the boat, truly touching the divine. No recount of this book would be complete without a mention of George Pocock, the English boat building legend who hand crafted his unmatched wooden racing sculls in the loft of the Washington boat house. Pocock is nearly Yoda-like in his dispensing of sage advice about rowing and life in his own quiet way, and becomes a vital part of the Washington team. I am not a rower and knew very little about the sport before reading this book other than watching it in the Olympics and seeing the boats ply the Charles River in the early morning on past trips to Boston. Author Daniel James Brown makes the sport and the history of this remarkable team truly come alive in a way I did not expect. Very highly recommended. Special note: The photos included in the book are excellent, and deserve a special mention. Doing additional research after finishing \"The Boys in the Boat\" I was surprised to find terrific footage of the team in action on YouTube in a clip from Leni Riefenstahl's controversial film about the 1936 Berlin games, \"Olympia.\"", "id": "26"}
{"review": "Daniel James Brown did an incredible job telling the tale of the nine young men who rowed for the USA in the 1936 Olympics and their coaches. For the most part, the story is told from the perspective of one of the rowers, Joe Rantz, who surmounted numerous challenges from his early childhood onward that would have crushed many people twice his age. The author also provides some interesting background on George Pocock and how he came to develop the racing shell used by the Washington Crew team. While outside of rowing, it was also fascinating to hear about Joe Rantz's childhood in the 20s and 30s and what it was like being part of the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam. Along those line, the author's description of the current world events of the time -- namely the Great Depression and the rise of Nazi Germany -- provided great context in appreciating the story. In fine, the context and descriptions provided made it very easy to visualize and appreciate the magnitude of accomplishments of the Washington Crew Team. One final note -- I very much appreciated all of the photographs and end notes in the book; the former provided a welcomed additional dimension and the latter allowed me to delve a little deeper into the story. I heartily concur with the PR stating that if you enjoyed books such as \"Seabiscuit\" and \"Unbroken\" you will also enjoy \"The Boys in the Boat\".", "id": "26"}
{"review": "\"The Boys in the Boat\" is the well-researched tale of the University of Washington rowing crew that captured a gold medal in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Author Brown adroitly ties together a wide net of coaching problems, family issues, myriad rowing technicalities, and timely political hot points to name a few. Readers will definitely learn how a serious crew is put together. The author also shines a sometimes critical light on the Nazi rise to power of the early 1930s. There was no escaping the intrusion of politics in this particular Olympiad, since the Nazi hierarchy carefully planned the Games as a major propaganda ploy. This knavery appears to have succeeded-in the short term. Of special note is the portrayal of a gussied up Berlin and the dramatic opening ceremonies. The preceding is the positive news. The more bothersome aspects of BB include: The technicalities of competitive rowing are vastly overstated. What was fascinating at first became repetitive and even mundane. All sports have their technical parts. Even an outwardly simple game like baseball can be made blindingly boring by the paralysis of analysis. Also, there were far too numerous \"crucial\" meets on the road to Berlin. All those big time races in Oakland, Poughkeepsie and Seattle blended into each other. This pronounced buildup almost manages to make the actual Olympic events an anticlimax. This text needed to be thinned out. That proverbial \"stern editor with a sharp blue pencil\" was sorely needed here. That statement is in no way meant as a criticism of the author. Brown is an enthusiastic guy who may have become carried away with his work. The burden here lies with the publisher to restore some order. Maybe all those editors have been laid off, but the need for pruning continues. The rating above is a tad stern but one has to call them as he sees them. Serious crew fans, Seattle natives and Husky fans will wish to add a star or two to the rating above. Those good folks may have strong, even patriotic feeling about \"The Boys in the Boat\". Those sentiments are fully respected by this reader. It is that kind of story.", "id": "26"}
{"review": "Daniel James Brown has written an excellent book about a little-known story, at least to me. The book tells the story of the 1936 University of Washington eight-oar crew and their journey to win an Olympic gold medal. This journey took them through the crew teams from the eastern US universities, then through famous British university crew teams, and finally through the heavily favored German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler. Mr. Brown draws upon diaries and journals to tell the stories of the team members. He covers all of the young men but focuses particularly on Joe Rantz, a young man with no family and no particular prospects. The crew comes together under a somewhat puzzling coach and an eccentric British boat builder. All of this makes for a fascinating story. This is an extremely good book which could be enjoyed by anyone. If you enjoy tales of underdogs coming together to reach a goal in the face of huge odds, then you will like this book. It has been compared to Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken. I'm not sure that it is quite in that league, but it is a very good book .", "id": "26"}

{"review": "Walter Lord weaves an exciting tale as he relates the British 'evacuation' (i.e. retreat) of Dunkirk. The Brits were aided by several 'miracles' that are closely examined by Lord: Hitler's decision to stop his tanks from annihilating the escaping British (he was saving the tanks for France), 9 days of calm seas on the English Channel, and literally thousands of small private English boats that aided in the escape of some 338,000 troops - essentially the entire British Expeditionary Force and a sizeable force of French soldiers. Lord describes the Churchhill's efforts to keep the French happy as they were left alone on the Continent. In his \"We Shall Fight on the Beaches\" speech of June 4, 1940, Churchhill acknowledged to the House of Commons, \"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted.\" The escape from Belgium encouraged Churchill: \"We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.\" Lord interviewed some 500 survivors of Dunkirk to write his book, which informs the telling with an immediacy and verite missing from more academic treatments. Highly recommended for the general reader of history, especially WW II.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "There have been few books on this subject (at least those available in the U.S.), and this book describes this crisis well. Over 300,000 troops escaped envolopement from the Germans by evacuating from Dunkirk. Lord does his capable best in writing how the British and French were outflanked and almost destroyed, but the Germans turned a great victory into a minor one. Goring and his Luftwaffe did inflict terrible damage and caused much death, but the fact is the greater part of the British Expedionary Force was allowed to escape and fight again another day. One thing I like about Lord's writings are his personalization of the conflicts. We hear from soldiers who actually fought and escaped through Dunkirk. His writings also tell the story through a description of what went on and the military strategy involved. Lord is one of my favored authors. He devoted much time (2 years) for each book he has written. It is a shame we no longer have him here to write great books.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "The evacuation of Dunkirk after the Nazi blitzkreig of 1940 has always amazed me. This is a period and event that don't figure too prominently into most textbooks, even though it was one of the most crucial times in World War II (just because Pearl Harbor wasn't bombed yet, after all, doesn't mean there wasn't a war on). I was quite pleased with the way Walter Lord was able to pull together all of the information about the evacuation and the events leading up to it. The story is complex. Columns of refugees heading to the coast, the British plan for evacuation, the Belgian surrender nearly dooming the effort, resistance to keep a pocket around Dunkirk and the beaches, weather conditions and how they affected air battles, the use of the mole...Lord has managed to fit it all in and more. The book is very good in presenting a general account of how events occurred. Lord has also managed to find several personal stories and tidbits, from the acts of officers in helping the evacuation to the unsuccessful attempt to use kites as barrage balloons at the harbor.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "\"The Miracle of Dunkirk\" is a view of the incredible rescue of the British Expeditionary Force from France in 1940. Dubbed Operation Dynamo, its story is mostly told from the perspective of the individual soldiers and sailors involved without neglecting the big picture. Author Walter Lord tells the story of the collapse of the Allied lines, the alternative lines of withdrawal and the ultimate retreat into the Dunkirk perimeter along with the strategies devised in London, Paris and Berlin. Once the option of fighting to join the French forces to the south closed, the development of the sealift began to materialize with the call for all types of vessels to assemble for sailing to France. This book, as any book dealing with Dunkirk, addresses the question of why Hitler held back the land assault for three days. Was he making a political overture to the British? Did he really believe that the Luftwaffe could do the job alone? Was he holding the tanks for other tasks later? Read the book to find Lord's conclusion. As I mentioned, this story is largely seen through the eyes of the individuals involved, and they had quite a story to tell. The accounts of the fighting along the perimeter, the relentless bombing of land and sea, the gaps in air cover and the harrowing crossings give the reader some insight into the heroism and horror of those eight days of deliverance. Walter Lord is a master story teller who holds the reader's interest and is never boring. This book belongs in the library of anyone with an interest in World War II.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "The book shows you not just the human courage of the evacuation itself but it also sets the scene admirably and explains why the British Army did what it did and how the Admiralty rose to the challenge that it was handed. The work of the Royal Navy (and indeed the civilian volunteers int he little ships) is absolutely astounding. Dunkirk was obviously a place of contrasts. Some units show an amazing level of discipline and initiative. Others appear to be a rabble, and the book captures this in a way that is very plausible and understandable. It paints a very good protriat of the BEF in May and June 1940. It also gives an interesting insight into the French High Command problems. The book is very readable and should appeal to the casual reader as well as the scholar, especially since the notes on sources are pretty comprehensive which is just what the academic is looking for, no matter how readable.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Typical of Walter Lord, this book is assiduously researched and also has a gripping narrative. He also manages to capture the human aspect: the description of the remaining French soldiers silently watching the last British and French troops leaving is quite haunting.

It will rate highly alongside some of the other, higher-profile accounts of the withdrawal.", "id": "9"}

{"review": "I like this book because it is an account of an event that I lived through. Yes, I am one of Richard's fellow surgical technicians who worked at 3rd Field Hospital in Saigon. His account is truthful. The events he describes are real and were probably more traumatic than he makes them out to be. His book is more significant not only because it tells a story that needs to be told, but because he also explores the politics surrounding the war in Vietnam including government decisions, the families waiting at home, the college protesters and the experience of returning home. Sadly, we are still seeing our politicians getting involved in places outside of our country and recklessly wasting the lives of our military. They have not learned and Richard's account of the Vietnam war helps demonstrate this. History is a powerful learning tool and we all need to be more aware of it's lessons.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "While I was not alive during the Vietnam War, I have lived through several other wars in my time and can truly identify with the anger and frustration Richard Pena felt having to serve in a senseless war. While both of my grandfathers served in World War II, my father, unlike Richard Pena, was fortunate to have escaped the draft in Australia by dousing his hands with chemicals for several weeks and getting a letter from a family doctor indicating he was not able to serve. I am also very fortunate that I have never had to experience war. War is and will always be hell and Richard Pena’s harrowing accounts of his work as an operating specialist give us a glimpse into the devastating human cost of this senseless war, while John Hagan provides astute historical and political context for these journal entries. This makes for a very easy and fascinating read as the book is both historical and personal. I think we are only too lucky that Richard Pena’s wife noticed that picture of him in the Ho Chi Minh museum boarding the last plane otherwise his story might never have been told. Importantly, Richard Pena’s journal entries document a particularly tragic moment in history when the Americans had essentially lost the war and those left in Vietnam were just trying to make it out alive. While there have been a number of books on combat in Vietnam, I am not aware of as many by operating specialists, who’s experiences of human suffering would have been traumatic, as Richard Pena’s entries attest. Though at times the entries can be disturbing to read, they are at once simple and profound accounts of the best and worst of humanity, as well as the sheer absurdity of fighting a war for some abstract and elusive ideology that is highly topical even four decades later. While this book will undoubtedly resonate with those alive during Vietnam and even more so, those who served, I believe it will also serve as a timeless tale of the horrors of the Vietnam War so that we as a society may never forget the damage war does to the human spirit and humanity more generally.", "id": "9"}

Also, I needed to remember what went on during that tragic place we called Nam! I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm one of those Americans who was so caught up with Watergate that I missed what was happening over there. Apparently I'm not alone. Watergate overshadowed the final months of Vietnam. Thank you Richard Pena for helping us to never forget what went on at the end of that tragic war.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "As one that volunteered for the draft in 1966 even though I held a 2-S deferment, and having made it back from the 'Nam fulfilled a promise to myself that I would finish college and get a law degree. I read and speak about the Vietnam War frequently. It is the defining event for men my age, now 68, and all males of the baby boom generation weigh our decisions made as 18 to 20 something year olds against what we did during that war. Decisions made then have lifetime consequences. I was 11Bravo, light weapons infantry, arrived in Vietnam in early January '67 and spent 11 and 1/2 months in the boonies with Dogface Charlie, Big Red One. My core job became squad leader, but I walked beaucoup point. So, for the initiated, it is understood that my experiences in that war are far removed from Richard Pena's experiences as described in Last Plane. His descriptions of his down time sounded like R&R to me, but I wouldn't trade my job for his OR duties then or now. Similarly, I'm certain that he wouldn't make that trade either. Our experiences in Vietnam are as different as night and day, yet--they are the same, and the impact is forever. Pena's observations are solid, thoughtful, and on occasion too dramatic but, to me, a welcome addition to the Vietnam War literature. For 1972-73 the work is authentic, not so for 1966-68, but that is Vietnam. Each of us that paid our dues in that war have a story to tell, a story unique to us. Congratulations to Pena for sharing his story. Hagen's academic contribution to the work is thought provoking, in large part, but he is so far removed from the grunts that actually fought the NVA and Viet Cong in the jungles, where there were no civilians, and the enemy tried very hard to kill us as we did them, he doesn't seem to appreciate that there was a war on the ground where, ultimately, wars are fought.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "The personal experience of the Vietnam conflict is relived through the informal journals and memoirs of Richard Pena who, as one of the country's last draftees, served as an Operating Room Specialist in the U.S. Army Third Field Hospital in Saigon. Mr. Pena's reflections provide a poignant back story to America's closing involvement in the decade-long, controversial war that galvanized social, political and cultural upheaval and turbulence of the late 1960's and late early 1970's . Last Plane is a quick read that allows the reader to share Mr. Pena's insights into the air of \"organized chaos\" that can charge the atmosphere in a field medical facility. More importantly, it focuses on the emotional impact and stress that is generated in caring for seriously wounded military personnel with horrific, battle-related injuries. It should be noted that many of the casualties and deaths at this juncture were compiled while the United States designed its exit strategy and the Paris Peace Agreement were being arduously hammered-out. The reader also gets a glimpse into the routine of Mr. Pena and his comrades who bonded in their off-duty hours and contemplated what it must be like, back home in the \"Real World\". Mr. Pena provides brief sketches of his fellow soldiers and medical cohorts, rather than complex in-depth character development in the style of other Vietnam era writers like Tim O'Brien or Ron Kovic. Juxtaposed, with Mr. Pena's chapters, are introductory prefaces by John Hagan, Professor of Sociology and Law at Northwestern University. Mr. Hagan succinctly highlights the key political events and social trends that weave through the time frame of this book. His summaries provide historical background and real time insight into the context of Mr. Pena's memoirs before, during, and after his Vietnam experiences. In light of America's decade long involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, this book is a timely, prophetic reminder of how each conflict has its own blend of sacrifice and loss that have longstanding influence on the individual and the fabric of society. Valuable and costly lessons are learned on many levels in each of these endeavors. These lessons must be preserved to enlighten future decision makers from making the same mistakes and miscalculations. Mr. Pena's book should be recommended reading for anyone who wants a personal look at the Vietnam experience and its historical, political, and social significance to America then and now.", "id": "9"}

{"review": "In the book, Visions of War, Dreams of Peace: Writings of Women in the Vietnam War, Mary O'Brien Tyrrell, a veteran of the Vietnam War, tells of a conversation with her thirteen-year-old daughter that took place in 1986. \"Why write about it now? Tyrrell's daughter asks, referring to a collection of poems that her mother had written about her experiences in Vietnam. \"What difference does it make?\" the daughter wants to know. In the last stanzas of her poem titled \"Hindsight,\" Tyrrell makes it clear that her poetic recollections provided a long overdue salve for \"the wounds, the waste, the loss.\" Tyrrell finds that the letters she sent home during her time in Vietnam were lacking: \"No mention there of war and pain, casualties and loss.\" \"I need to write it now,\" Tyrrell explains. More than forty years after the end of the Vietnam War, Richard Pena and his co-author, John Hagan, have released Pena's recollections of his time in Vietnam. Using the words of Mary Tyrrell's daughter, one might ask Pena, \"Why write about it now? What difference does it make?\" Even as he was composing his journal back in 1972, Pena questioned whether he was wasting his time. He muses at one point in his journal, \"Why write anything at all? Then he quickly answers, \"[t]here is a story here which must be told to all; there is a story here which must never be forgotten.\" Years later, Pena would ask himself the question, \"What would the soldiers whose names are on the National Vietnam Memorial want now?\" Pena's answer to that question is simple. He believes those soldiers would want the truth to be told. Pena elaborates, \"It is for the sake of the 58,286 soldiers whose names are etched on the Wall, their families, the 3,100,000 soldiers who served in the Vietnam War--and, most of all, the truth, that John Hagan and I have pushed this book to publication.\" Exactly what are the truths that emerge from Pena's book? I have identified three that stand out for me. First, there was little justice, fair play or logic in the conduct of the Vietnam War. Pena would write in Winter 1972, \"What was right back home is the wrong approach in Vietnam--if you want to survive. And what was wrong back home is right in Vietnam--if you want to survive.\" It seems to have taken Pena eight months of observation to have grasped that paradox. One can only feel regret for those soldiers who may have lacked equivalent powers of observation. Second, politicians are not infallible and, frequently, are not even honorable. To support this belief, Pena and Hagan quote no less a source than Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Years after his role as one of the primary architects of the war, McNamara had written, \"Yet we were wrong, terribly wrong. We owe it to future generations to explain why.\" Third, it is impossible to overstate the tragic proportions of the Vietnam experience and what the United States lost in the war. At one point, Pena tells of tending to an Army sergeant who had survived the crash of a C-130 in the Mekong Delta. Unbeknownst to the sergeant, he was one of only three survivors on a flight carrying 40 soldiers. \"There were some really fine boys on that plane,\" the sergeant tells Pena. The same can be said of Vietnam in general. There were some really fine soldiers, male and female, in that war. I enjoyed Richard Pena's reflections. I enjoyed his writing. There are points where, amazingly, his words appear, at first glance, to be in inherent conflict with each other but actually unveil a thought that strikes me as being truly profound. When describing the joy that a soldier experiences as he prepares to board a \"Freedom Bird\" out of Vietnam, Pena writes, \"[t]his is a state in which the object of happiness is happiness itself and the event that triggers the happiness is but the vehicle.\" So, there's a \"vehicle,\" an initial stage of happiness and a second, more sublime phase of happiness, with the process culminating on the soldier's arrival on U.S. soil. I liked the way that Pena characterized the process. Does Pena accomplish the goals he has set out for himself? I think he does. For me, it was very interesting and enjoyable reading. Like Mary Tyrrell, he tells of the wounds, the waste, the loss. He does so in a compelling manner.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I've known Richard Pena for many years as a top-flight lawyer and bar leader. So it is fascinating to hear the full story of his experience in Vietnam. I also am a Vietnam vet, having served at Camp Red Devil in Quang Tri province in 1969-70. It is clear after reading Richard's account that a tour of duty in a hospital operating room exposes you to war in its most concentrated form, since the wounded and dying continually parade through your days and nights. That's one reason this book is so valuable. Those who make the decision to send us to war need to know the dramatic consequences of their decisions on the bodies and minds of their sons--and now daughters. The recent book by Nick Turse, \"Kill Anything That Moves,\" provides compelling evidence of the corrosive effect of the relentless guerilla war in Vietnam on our command structure, leading our troops to behavior that too often violated American ideals about protection of the innocents on behalf of whom the war is fought. For those of us who made it back from Vietnam--or from Iraq or Afghanistan--the most useful perspective may be to live the fullest lives possible, in honor of those who didn't make it. In the words of Captain Miller from \"Saving Private Ryan,\" we need to \"earn it.\" And one way to earn it may be to do what we can to avoid sending American lives and fortunes and sacred honor into some future military adventure where the victory to be won is too tenuous or obscure or uncertain to justify what we now know, beyond all doubt, to be the consequences of modern American war fighting. Richard Pena has earned it.", "id": "9"}

{"review": "I read this book in two days flat and I know that, had I had the time, I would have read it in one sitting. This is a book that grips you, draws you in and leaves you feeling a slightly better person for having read it. The story is that of Louie Zamperini - a track and field star of the 1930's, who participated in the Berlin olympics, was part of the US air force in WWII, was shot down over the ocean, was adrift in the Pacific for over a month, was held as a POW by the Japanese forces and finally made it back to his life and has had the courage to live it to its fullest. Hillenbrand is a marvellous author. I was never tempted to read Seabiscuit and this was my first introduction to her work. She is one of a few authors who can write a non fiction story in the most gripping and vivid way imaginable. Instead of being flowery or overly embellished her prose relies squarely on research and on witness accounts and yet manages to never be dull. The swiftly moving story takes the reader from Zamperini's early beginnings, his swift rise to track star, the Berlin olympics and then to the World War. This is where the story really blooms. Hillenbrand settles in for the long haul here and we get to see the air force and the B24 bombers through the words of the men who actually flew them. The sequences where Zamperini and his friend Phil are adrift at sea are vivid and strangely beautifully described. The horrors that await them at the Japanese prison camps are not glossed over but neither does Hillenbrand wallow in the gore and violence as some authors may be tempted to do. There is always a strong sense of the respect the author holds for the men whose story she is being allowed to tell. History has perhaps focused its eye too exclusively on the war in Europe to the extent where the situation in the Pacific and the plight of POW's there has not recieved the attention and the respect it deserves. Hillenbrand's book and detailed research certainly makes a strong attempt to change that. Solidly based on statistics and army reports from both sides of the war, Hillenbrands book paints a clear picture of the hellish conditions that the POW's endured and the utter madness of the war that was being waged in the Pacific. This is a hard story to read but one that is well worth it. The falling apart of Louie's life and his slow path to regaining his life and sense of purpose is a story that is truly inspiring. This book will find a permanent place of honor on my bookshelf.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Louis Zamperini? Who is he? Laura Hillenbrand's near 500-page reply will answer the question not only once, but for all. He is the California boy who was a kleptomaniac. He is the running prodigy who competed at Hitler's Berlin Olympics, shook hands with the Fuhrer, and was almost shot by Nazi guards for stealing a Nazi souvenir. He is the American serviceman who entered the Pacific theater, crashed into the sea, and spent a harrowing forty-odd days floating on a disintegrating raft circled by aggressive sharks, scorched by a relentless sun, and gnawed to the bone by an inescapable hunger. Who is Louis Zamperini? He is a man who overcame all THAT only to be \"rescued\" by the wrong side -- the Japanese. He is the man who went from being a prisoner of starvation and sharks that actually leaped up and tried to snatch him out of the foundering raft to being a prisoner of Japanese guards who were every bit as predatory as the great white of the seas. He is the man who was beaten every day by a particular Japanese corporal named Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a.k.a. \"the Bird.\" He is, in short, the Unbroken One -- the man who kept getting up, coming back, rebounding, and holding on to the tenuous thread that connected him with life and hope, past any duration that any of us could possibly imagine. And, as YOU can imagine, his story is compelling. In fact, in the capable hands of Laura Hillenbrand, author of SEABISCUIT, it reads like a thriller, a page-turner, a fictional product of a keenly talented mind -- proving once again that truth can trump fiction when it comes to stories and mankind's love of hearing them. When you reach the end of this man's incredible journey, you will be awed by the scope of Hillenbrand's writing. It is clear that she did a vast amount of research -- reading letters, telegrams, newspaper clippings, radio transcripts, etc., AND interviewing not only Zamperini himself, but his family members, friends, surviving fellow servicemen, and even Japanese captors. Woven in her biography are many statistics and facts from the history of World War II as well. You will learn about the science of survival -- why certain men live and certain men die -- and about the strengths and weaknesses of America's planes that carried servicemen over the vast distances of the Pacific Ocean. You will learn about the war strategy, the Japanese culture and its effects on treatment of POWs as well as on conducting (and refusing to surrender in) a war to the bitter end. And, sadly, you will learn about the aftermath of war in Japan. It's all here, bigger than life, packed into the small frame of one man from Torrance, California -- a man that could, and did, live to tell about a page in history we hope never to repeat. Both a personal tale of redemption and resilience, UNBROKEN is destined to become a classic in the category of narrative nonfiction. Ordinarily I'm a fiction guy, but I was spellbound from the start. Honest. Give it a try. It's big, but reads small. I think, when you reach the end, you, too, will sing its (and Louie's) praises (at 93, Zamperini is still alive and still \"Unbroken\"!).", "id": "2"}
{"review": "No one can accuse Laura Hillenbrand, author of Seabiscuit: An American Legend, of ever doing a half-effort job of research when she writes narrative nonfiction. Spending seven years on this effort, the Author has produced one of the most detailed stories of an American POW being held by the Japanese during World War II that I have ever read. With the many interviews with the subject during her research, along with interviews of family members, other POW's and their families, reading over unpublished memoirs, personal letters, and military documents, it would have been easy for this book to have become a long drawn-out and sterile narrative that would read like a text book. Instead we're treated to a captivating and at times heart-wrenching story that takes a group of unknowns and present them in a way that you truly come to know them. The subject of the book is Louis Zamperini, whose life would have been an interesting read even before the events during WWII. A relatively trouble child who stole everything in sight, he grows up to become one of the greatest track stars of his time, shattering the national high school record in the mile and becoming one of the youngest members of the U.S. Olympic team in 1936. Many felt that Zamperini would become the first person to break the four minute mile. With the onset of the war, he was drafted into the Army Air Force and became a bombardier assigned to the semi-unreliable B-24. After surviving a number of bombing missions against Japanese targets his plane goes down in the middle of the ocean while searching for another downed plane. What follows is a story of survival by sheer will, first being adrift at sea for 46 days and then spending over two brutal years as a POW in Japan. Hillenbrand takes us step-by-step through the events, introducing us to other Allied prisoners as well as a number of the Japanese guards and personnel. Her descriptions of the brutality Louie, as well as other prisoners, went through are very detailed and heart-wrenching. His daily beatings from a guard known as \"The Bird\" would have been enough to break anyone but Zamperini endured each one. One thing I found interesting is not only did she name names of the guards that tortured the prisoners mercilessly she also did not shy away from pointing out the Japanese personnel who did their best to shield the prisoners even at the risk of their own safety. Then after the war the Author takes us through the post-traumatic years as Zamperini's life spirals downward, and his eventual rebirth as he learns forgiveness and peace. I would highly recommend this to those looking for an inspiring story of, as the sub-title of the book says, \"Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.\" Just be aware, a large portion of the story will focus on the brutality and suffering inflicted on the POW's by the Japanese war machine. It can be at times a very disturbing and difficult narrative to read, one that can bring tears to your eyes. It is both one of the best books of the WWII POW experience I've read, and one of the most troubling.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is the long (500 pages) extremely detailed, meticulously researched and extremely moving story of a Hero. And yes, the caps on \"hero\" was intentional. In the first half of the book we get a detailed biography of Louis Zamperini- bad boy, then track and field star and Olympic contender. Possibly too detailed here, I admit. We then segue into WWI and Lt Zamperini's Air Corps career as a B-24 bombardier. Great stuff here, goes into fascinating detail about the B24 Liberator and the men who flew them in the Pacific. The last portion here is a harrowing tale of survival in the open seas, one of the best I have read. Then, Louie Zamperini gets captured by the Japanese. Folks, watching Bridge on the River Kwai will not prepare you for the brutality and inhumanity of the horrors Laura Hillenbrand brings to life here. Now, this is a gripping adventure story, well told, one that is hard to put down. But I had to put this book down in a couple places here, the story was that brutally true. A tale of unbelievable endurance, hardship and heroism. A real page turner, extremely well written and readable.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "In \"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption,\" author Laura Hillenbrand (of Seabiscuit: An American Legend tells the story of Louis Zamperini, a bad boy turned track and field star, who participated in the 1936 Berlin Olympic and even met Hitler. Narrowly escaping arrest for attempting to piler a Nazi flag, Zamperini returned home, washed out as a pilot and eventually ended up in the Army Air Corps as a B-24 bombardier. Then, in May 1943, his plane goes down. He and one of his crewmates endure over 47 days before they find land, but, unfortunately, they land in enemy terrain, and are sent to a POW camp, where the story gets even more harrowing and brutal. The story of Zamperini's ordeal, survival and eventual return home, with its own attendant struggles, is one of the most gripping tales of heroism and sheer toughness, mental and physical, that I have ever read. I must admit, I was a bit worried that Ms. Hillenbrand, after having written the excellent Seabiscuit, would suffer a \"sophomore slump.\" My worries were completely unfounded. Ms. Hillenbrand has the rare gift for setting atmosphere, including vast amounts of tightly-integrated background information, yet her narrative never drags or slows. Every detail was meticulously researched - I can only imagine how much work that took - and she did an incredible effort of setting the stage. I also appreciated the even-handedness of her approach, particularly when singling out the kind and humane guards in the Japanese POW camp, who took tremendous risks. Another standout section of the book, although brief, was the difficulty soldiers had in returning back to \"normal life\" after the war. This is one of the best books, historical or not, that I have ever read, and would make an outstanding movie as well. Five-plus stars.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I remember quite clearly when reading Laura Hillenbrand's \"Seabiscuit\" about the famous racehorse that this might be a once-in-a-lifetime book for the author, that she would probably never find so compelling a story to focus upon. Hillenbrand herself says much the same thing in the afterword to her new \"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption\" (due to be released to the public in the next couple weeks) -- but then she learned about Louie Zamperini. Zamperini, as the son of immigrant Italians in California in the 1930s, seemed a sure candidate for everybody's \"Most Likely to Go to Reform School\" list. Then, his older brother convinced him to try out for the high school track team, and a great natural gift for running was discovered. In short order, his academic and disciplinary record reversed itself, and soon Zamperini was a student at USC and one of the brightest stars of the American track scene, often touted as being the man most likely to break the fabled four minute barrier in running the mile. He was on the US team at the 1936 (Berlin) Olympics where he did respectably, although it was believed that with a little more maturity his real opportunity to win gold would come at the 1940 (Tokyo) Olympics. Then, World War II started. Louis Zamperini found himself a B24 bombadier in the Pacific, where long distance over-water flying in aircraft of dubious mechanical reliability probably killed more air crew than combat. In 1943 Zamperini's plane disappeared while on a search-and-rescue mission, and Zamperini and the rest of the crew were presumed killed. Instead, he and the pilot survived 47 days in a life raft before being found and \"rescued\" by the Japanese, landing Zamperini in a succession of POW camps for the next two years. It was a horrid, brutal experience, and it makes for intensely distressing reading. Zamperini was singled out by one particular chief guard, perhaps because of his sports fame, perhaps because of his unbowed attitude, for unrelenting, sadistic attention. Yet, despite the beatings and torture and almost nonexistent food and terrible living conditions Zamperini survived. Restored to the States after the end of the War, Zamperini married but quickly descended into a desperate spiral of alcohol and anger that threatened his marriage and his life. But, improbably enough, when he was dragged reluctantly to a Billy Graham camp meeting by his estranged wife, Zamperini found it within himself to let go of his wholly understandable anger and thirst for revenge, and literally reformed himself overnight, becoming an inspirational speaker and advocate for troubled youths. As of this writing, he is still hale and hearty, an indomitable optimist. Hillenbrand has once again found herself a perfect subject (Zamperini told her that it would be easier to write about him than Seabiscuit because he, at least, could talk), and again has demonstrated her skill in constructing a highly compelling story, vividly drawing upon the memories of a large cast of friends and family and former enemies. \"Unbroken\" is a marvelous book. The account of Zamperini's POW years is tough stuff, to be sure, but Hillenbrand's focus on an extraordinary character is unwavering.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "There are thousands of books written about World War Two. Some tell the story of battles; some follow the history of the whole war, or this or that theater. Some focus on the plight of the Prisoners of War. Some are memoirs, or biographies. Unbroken must join the bibliography of the Pacific War as one of the best personal narratives written. Laura Hillenbrand, famous for her story of Seabiscuit, picks up the story of one young man, Louie Zamperini, troublemaker, runner, bombardier, and runs with it. He was lost in the crash at sea of his B24 Green Hornet. Lost at sea, he drifted for weeks in a life raft with two of his crewmates. They broke all records for survival in such a craft. Two of them made it, through shark infested waters, hunger and thirst to land. That's where their ordeal began. Now, a survival against nature story turns into something more terrible and ominous. Zamperini must contend and deal with the blackest shadows of human nature while a POW in wartime Japan. Against all odds he survives, after being officially declared dead and returns to a grateful nation. He and his fellow POWs suffer the after effects of their ordeals for years after the war and again, Zamperini sinks into his own private hell. Then, when in deepest despair, he meets a young Billy Graham and his life turns around once more. He finds finally redemption and returns to Japan not as a messenger of hate but as a herald of hope and forgiveness. I loved this book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is likely to be the book of the year for several reasons. It is beautifully written and beautifully structured. It has a compelling and inspirational subject. It is filled to the brim with fascinating facts (Which parts of a shark are edible? What was the mortality rate in Japanese prison camps versus that in Italian/German ones? What is it like to fly a B-24?). It is the product of exhaustive research. It combines the advantages and attractiveness of biography with the strengths and strategies of suspense fiction. By now, most will be familiar with the subject. In Seabiscuit Laura Hillenbrand studied a California racer. She does the same in Unbroken, with the distinct advantage that (as her subject pointed out to her) he can actually talk and tell her what happened. Her subject, Louie Zamperini, was a difficult child who matured into an Olympic runner, racing in Berlin in 1936. He joined the Army Air Force in WWII, serving as a bombardier. His hideously-unreliable B-24 plummeted into the Pacific and he and two fellow fliers floated in an open raft toward the Marshall Islands, fighting heat, thirst, starvation, sharks and strafings from a Japanese plane along the way. Interned in several Japanese prison camps he was treated mercilessly and criminally. Saved by the American forces in the Pacific, the relentless bombing of Japan by B-29's and, quintessentially, by the flight of the Enola Gay, he was freed and returned home. Enslaved by persistent memories and alcohol, his marriage on the edge, he was saved by none other than Billy Graham. He remains alive today at 93, still feisty and active. This is the perfect Christmas gift for anyone, but particularly for those who remember the war, those who experienced it directly and those who need to be educated concerning it. Be warned, however. Once they start reading the book they will be absent from the rest of the family's holiday activities until they complete it.

{"review": "A riveting account of what happened during the \"battle of Benghazi\". The book is hard to put down. It is the account of what happened during the attack on our diplomatic outpost and CIA annex by the heroic defenders of the compounds. The book describes what the State Department's security team experienced during the attack. The book contains little of the political back and forth just the facts of what happened during the attack. The book reads like a great thriller novel. The story shows heroes still exist in this world of ambivalence.", "id": "9"}

{"review": "The Wars of the Roses are one of the most confusing periods of English history. From the origins in the rivalries between Edward III's children to the final resolution with the founding of the Tudor dynasty by Henry VII, there are eight kings, including some of the best and worst England has had; and literally scores of major figures and families: the Nevilles, the Percys, the Woodvilles, the Beauforts, the Cliffords, the Bourchiers -- the list is endless. Making this all comprehensible the first time through is simply impossible. Weir almost manages it, though; her style is very readable and friendly, and exciting without being sensational. Weir begins with a short section describing what England was like in the fifteenth century; then she starts the story proper with Edward III, whose five sons and their families are the central players in the history. She ends her story in 1471, with the defeat of the Lancastrians and the subsequent murder of Henry VI. She only gives a page or two to the remainder of Edward IV's reign, and to the story of Richard III and the princes in the tower, and Henry VII's ultimate accession in 1485. This is almost certainly because she has covered this ground in another book, \"The Princes In The Tower\". The omission is understandable but still rather a mistake -- the conflict doesn't end till the Tudors are on the throne (and not even then, really -- there were pretenders for years). The only other criticism I have is that the genealogy tables at the back are too small to read easily. I tried using a magnifying glass but the reproduction is poor enough that some letters are blurred into unreadability. Even when it's readable, it's more work than it should be; this is a real problem for a book about the Wars of the Roses, where understanding the genealogy is crucial to keeping your bearings. Overall I can recommend this strongly, just because it'll give you the overall narrative clearly and excitingly, but you'll need another source to cover the period from 1471 to 1485.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This is a wonderfully readable history, covering the finalconflict between cousins (the House of Lancaster and the House ofYork, and then the House of York and the House of Tudor) over the crown of England. As the author states in her introduction, the full story begins in 1400 begins with a murder and ends in 1471 with another murder. Weir writes a history of people who come alive on her pages. The characters history has given her are ambitious, incompetent, promiscuous, indolent, and lustful. The tale history has given her is one of these characters acting outside the law, each for his/her own purposes and, in so doing it is an early story of violent \"politics of destruction\" in the literal sense. This story changed forever the history of England. I often judge how good a book is by whether I am moved to read another one by the same author, or on the same subject. I am now reading Weir's book on Elizabeth. If you are interested in a well written history of a pivotal period in English history, I would highly recommend that you give The Wars of the Roses a try.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "In terms of her attention to detail, the author has clearly done a thorough job. However, I've read much (if not all) of Weir's work (concerning Eleanor of of Aquitaine, Princes in Tower, wives and kids of Henry the VIII, and Elizabeth I), and I had to *push* myself through this one. I don't know how much of this is her fault, and how much of it is the fault of the Yorkists who were slow in finally eliminating Henry VI as a challenge to the throne- at one point I thought \"I'm gonna kill Henry myself if nobody else does soon.\" It is a taxing read and while I really enjoyed the other books, this one was more frustrating. The reversals of fortune were particularly frustrating- for example on one page, Jaspar Tudor has the title to Pembroke, which is stripped from him, given to somebody else who is called Pembroke repeatedly but then is killed about two pages later and the name of Pembroke is given back to Jaspar Tudor. So on one page, the name Pembroke is for the House of Lancaster, but then any reference to \"Pembroke\" means the guy is for the house of York, and then when it switches back to Jaspar, Pembroke is pro-Lancaster again-- So at some point you think to yourself, \"Wait, why is Pembroke for Edward- I thought he liked Henry... Oh yeah...\" One wonders why (for the sake of clarity)- Jaspar Tudor just can't be called Jaspar Tudor throughout. She is accurate, but at some point I wish clarity had become a priority. While this is a complaint that I and others have had about all of Weir's (and other historians' books), it's particularly troublesome here because of the vast number of people involved, as well as the number of years that it covers. If you are interested in the wars of the roses or the succession of the British monarchy, please, by all means get this book. My primary purpose in this recommendation is to set your expectations- I'm very glad I read the thing- I just wish I'd known what a task it would be. Reading this book is like going to the gym- I don't actually like doing it, but I like having done it.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I really enjoy learning about British history - and Alsison Weir does a great job. I did find, however, that The Wars of the Roses was the most complicated of her books that I have read. I believe this is because she almost has too much information and tries to share it all. Additionally, the names of people become very confusing in that people take on the names of their title. For example a man would be the Duke of York, then when he died, his son would be the Duke of York. Weir would say \"York...\" and it would be tough to know whether or not the switch had happened, and because there may be more than 2 people with this name through out the book, it serves to require a lot of effor to understand who was who, while reading the book. The charts at the back help, but again, it would have been nice to have a little more information to make the story easier to follow. Overall I find Alison Weir to be a great teller of history, but I were a new reader to this, I would start with The Six Wives of Henry VIII.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "\"The Wars of the Roses\" is an altogether fascinating account of what may be, I suspect , a not so well understood era of English medieval history. Alison Weir tells the story of the wars between the Houses of Lancaster and York in 15th century England in a most compelling manner. She allows the reader to get to know such disparate characters as the weak and unstable usurper Lancastrian King Henry VI and his ambitious and ruthless queen, Margaret of Anjou; the Duke of York, who led the fight against the Lancasters, at first attempting to establish good government in England under Henry VI, and later, with an eye toward taking the English throne for himself; and York's son, Edward, conscientious and competent, who, after the Duke's death, picked up his father's fallen banner and deposed Henry VI, becoming King Edward IV, and ultimately ending the Wars of the Roses. Weir weaves personalities and a highly complex series of events into a well organized, easily understandable and highly entertaining narrative. I found \"The Wars of the Roses\" to be thoroughly enjoyable and very well written indeed.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "I can say nothing but huge amount of praises for Allison Weir's War of the Roses. Its superbly readable, entertainingly fun and quite educational. But why would an author of her scholarship end the account of the War of the Roses at Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471? This is supposed to be a book on the War of the Roses, right? Its like writing a book on World War II and ending it at Stalingrad and Fall of Tunis in first half of 1943!! I read Weir's Princes in the Tower and that book is more like an investigation of their death and the blame. War of the Roses stuff were basically background material. So it can't be considered as \"second volume\" of this book. Since anyone who knows anything about War of Roses knows that the war \"officially\" ended with Battle of Bosworth in 1485 which saw the fall of Richard Plantagent to Henry Tudor which resulted in the total change of the royal line (even if they are all related in one ways or another), this book should have gone on that point. Weir probably thought that after Tewkesbury, there wasn't much going on military wise for 14 years until Bosworth but politics can be considered as a form of warfare back then and there were a lot of that going on to make War of the Roses one of the more interesting military conflicts in history. But until she stopped, Weir does a very good job and maybe, she can write a real \"second volume\" of this book.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "The time was fascinating enough for Shakespeare to have devoted three plays to it, and several more to its prelude. The various descendants of Edward III were fighting each other for the crown of England (and parts of France) throughout the middle 15th century, in a battle of cousin against cousin (even brother against brother) that later on became known as The Wars of the Roses. In this book Alison Weir gives a blow-by-blow account of the various conflicts in the reign of Henry VI and Edward IV. She has a long prelude wherein she sets the stage with the deposing of Richard II by Henry Bolingbroke (who became, then, Henry IV), his subsequent career, and that of Henry V, who died leaving the baby Henry VI king, setting the stage for the power struggles to come. Weir has clearly mastered her material, but still this story seemed curiously lifeless. There are murders and betrayals aplenty, and even occasional selfless and heroic behavior, but presented rather matter-of-factly. Besides this, there are a couple of problems that I see. One is perhaps typical of a history: unless the historian has the flair of a storyteller, it just becomes one damn thing after another. I found little that was compelling in a narrative with great possibilities, nor motivation for what seemed to be bizarre behavior on everyone's part. Another problem here was simply in a lack of supporting material. Maps of territories being contested, and diagrams of battles, would help to place these events in space and give each fight an identity. What is more, a dense chronicle like this one needs to be bristling with dates, perhaps as a running comment in a margin. We are given the day and the month constantly as things go on, but I found myself having forgotten the year, and unable to find it. Rather than constantly wading through detail, a reader should be able to get out and see the wider picture from time to time, too. It is with some relief that I turn to the Henry VI plays, even though the history is compressed and distorted to serve the drama. In Shakespeare, it all makes sense, somehow.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Weir does nothing so well as interpret fact. She succeeds more than most writers in conveying historical context, which is critical for a reader of history. It is almost impossible for us in the 20th century to put ourselves in the places of the people who participated in the Wars of the Roses without the help of someone like her. I especially recommend this book for readers of historical fiction. Weir's prose flows almost as smoothly as any novelist's, but you are left with history (as best as it can presented), not some fantasy. The Richard III fans out there should read this BEFORE reading the Princes in the Tower. While it is sometimes easier to read history when you already know what happens next, this book will hammer home needed perspective; such as, why pretenders to be kings (and princes) were doomed to death and not just doomed to losing their crowns.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "While Weir's book on the Wars of the Roses is very easy to read and very interesting, I find myself feeling lukewarm towards it. On the one hand, it is detailed just enough to be informative and not too convoluted; it is smoothly-written and gives a clear chronology of events; it begins at the root of the wars and continues until the Battle of Tewkesbury; and it attempts to illuminate the individual characters of important historical figures of the age. On the other hand, it was at times hysterically written, putting together known facts with completely unsupported statements (I still cannot figure out how, without any definitive accounts of Richard of York's appearance in existence, Weir confidently describes him as short, stout and square-faced, and then dismisses out-of-hand other possible descriptions of him). Then there's this gem taken from page 323: \"Edward was oblivious to the fact that [Elizabeth Wydville] was also calculating, ambitious, greedy, ruthless and arrogant.\" Let us forget for a moment that Weir forgot to put a comma after \"ruthless\". What irked me about this statement was that, despite its condemning and final tone, it is never backed up with any substantial form of reasoning. The reader is simply told this and never given any explanation. Weir brings up the fact that Elizabeth Woodville made her mother serve her on bended knee and her brother kneel to her in public, but this was common practice for queens of the era. Weir also calls the family rapacious for taking positions in court, a practice which was, for one, natural of a new queen's family, and two, not as extensive as she makes it out to be. While a case can certainly be made--justly or unjustly, as it may be evaluated--that Elizabeth was in fact greedy, ruthless, or calculating, it should not be made based on the flimsy support that Weir has employed, and certainly not in such an absolute manner. This is where I believe Weir was using hysterical writing to heighten the dramatic and gossipy feeling of the book. It's entertaining, to be sure, but not necessarily in good judgment, and leaves the reader somewhat shortchanged. The writing in itself is very standard and nothing special. In fact, it's almost average, but that did not hinder my reading of it because this is, after all, a history book which I was reading for history's sake. It's always nice when historians have literary talent too, but it's not strictly speaking necessary, at least in my opinion. One thing that did bother me, however, was the fact that the editor failed to catch a few mistakes where quotes were left open-ended (in other words, the end quotation mark was missing), leaving the reader to figure out where the quote ended and Weir's narrative recommenced. Though it was mostly a simple task to figure out, a few instances were hard to discern. Also, though this is no fault of Weir's, I would warn prospective buyers that this book only covers the events up to and including the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. Those wishing to read further must then acquire Weir's book on the princes in tower. Overall, I found The Wars of the Roses to be a fun, entertaining history, although Weir can fall into the habit of overstating her conclusions about certain figures and events which begins to seem a little like bias, although it doesn't totally cross that line. It seems that she was, for the most part, trying to be balanced, and this is a useful tool for anyone who wants a basic knowledge of the Wars. Buffs will not gain much from its reading, as it is mostly a chronology of main events with the usual detail. 3 stars. Recommended.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Weir does a good job of portraying a complicated period in English history. With that said, following are the main reasons why I did not give this book 5 stars. First, Weir is not consistent in the way that she refers to people. She would do all of her fans a big favor by referring to people by the given names, surnames and titles. This is especially true in a book like this where people's titles changed throughout the book due to their loyalty to one monarch or another, to the death of a father or to their marriage. Second, Weir's sentence structure is overly complicated at times. Third, although Weir includes eight genealogies of the main families involved in the book, they are very difficult to read because they use script for the typeface, rather than a more readible typeface. She does a masterful job of giving the reader a vivid picture of the personalities of the individuals involved in the Wars. Weir is also careful to point out the differences in opinion held by historians regarding issues like the number of people involved in the battles or the people responsible for deaths of certain individuals such as Henry VI. For those who are interested in pursuing this period in more detail, I recommend Charles Ross' The Wars of the Roses (an excellent survey of the period) or his biographies of Edward IV and Richard III. Ross is an expert on this period and was a professor of medieval history prior to his death. Although Ross is a traditional historian who uses loads of footnotes, his books are very easy to read.", "id": "9"}

{"review": "I read Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony by Lee G. Miller and loved it. It’s the story of, (surprise surprise), the lost first colony of America at Roanoke Virginia. Because Lee Miller is an historian and a clever person she postulates very convincingly a political motivation for the colony’s demise, turning America’s first European adventure and tragedy into an historical whodunnit. It’s a wonderful book and led me to write three outlines for possible novels based on the ideas, characters and situations she introduced me to. Yeah, I like it. Miller’s book is not perfect, people who approach it after reading a romance might be disappointed. Readers who just put down a history textbook might also wonder what’s going on. It’s non-fiction written to entertain and I think it succeeds. Miller sifts through thousands of historical sources I doubt the average reader would ever get around to. She adds a bit of logical conjecture, makes her arguments and leaves you knowing more about the time and place than you did before reading her book. It is an enriching book that stays with you. If you’re interested in history, early American colonization in particular, this book should already be on your list. If you’re one of those people who think that things just don’t happen in a vacuum, if you’ve ever fashioned a hat out of tin-foil or questioned the official story or lack thereof of anything, you’ll like Miller’s book. If you didn’t know that the Indians cut the underbrush of the forest, leaving only the oldest trees in a shady canopy so high and so nurtured that the first Europeans said they could gallop a horse through it, you’ll like Miller’s book.", "id": "9"}

The book offers a fascinating look at the political intrigue and infighting in the courts of Queen Elizabeth I and her successor, King James that may have contributed to the colony's demise by putting any rescue attempts on the proverbial back burner. Miller's premise that the John White and the colonists were intentionally set up to fail may be overstating the case a bit, but one can't argue with the notion that the colonists had bigger problems than those caused by the weather and ticking off the nearby native population. If you're looking for explosive new revelations brought to light by heretofore unknown evidence, keep on looking.

{"review": "When David Limbaugh let his friend Steve know that he had doubts about Christianity, he was surprised by Steve’s response. Instead of a blast of arrogant judgmentalism, Steve responded like a Christian should—with grace and evidence. What has happened since that time is told in this excellent new book. Limbaugh artfully tells his journey from skepticism about Christ to skepticism about skepticism and ultimately to trust in Christ. David is a lawyer, but he doesn’t write like a lawyer. While he’s intellectually precise, he writes as if he’s sitting across the table from you, anticipating your questions and objections. This is rare for a book of Christian evidences (often called Christian apologetics). Such books often read like technical manuals, but not Jesus on Trial. Limbaugh not only does a masterful job of highlighting the abundant evidence that supports Christianity, his insights into what the scriptures actually say will have you marveling at the tapestry of scripture and the Savior who wove it. From the very beginning, Limbaugh bares his soul, holding nothing back about how his previous doubts were shielded by an embarrassing lack of knowledge. He writes, “I knew, after all, that I hadn’t really given the Bible itself a hearing, much less a fair one. To my surprise— and this is embarrassing to admit—Steve showed me how verses of Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, were tied to others in content and theme with remarkable frequency. Amazingly, I had never looked at a reference Bible before, and I was blown away. My ignorance was on display, but Steve wasn’t remotely judgmental— to help me learn more, he even gave me that Bible. I was genuinely intrigued to discover that the Bible was not simply a mishmash of stories, allegories, alleged historical events, and moral lessons. There was obviously a pattern here, and for the first time in my life the Bible appeared to me to be thematically integrated. The scales on my eyes started peeling away.” His two chapters called “Aha Moments” reveal the numerous tipping points in Limbaugh’s journey where scale after scale fell away—tipping points that no honest seeker of truth can ignore. Of course, as Limbaugh admits, many who are not interested in truth, or have their own agenda, ignore or remake Christ in their own image. He writes, “We must not casually remake Jesus in the image in which we prefer to see Him or which conforms to the popular culture’s misperceptions about Him. Our politically correct culture may, presumptuously, choose to recast Jesus as indifferent to sin and saccharine sweet, no matter the circumstances, but this Jesus is God, and God cannot look upon sin. What do these revisionists make of the Jesus Who made a whip of cords and drove the moneychangers out of the Temple (John 2: 15)? … What do the revisionists say about the Jesus Whom Paul describes as “revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus ” (2 Thess. 1: 7– 8)? What of the difficult moral standard Jesus laid down in the Sermon on the Mount? Did He show indifference to sin there?” Limbaugh rightfully concludes: “This idea that Jesus is meek, mild, indifferent, and non-judgmental is the stuff of pure myth.” In addition to correcting the culture’s emasculated view of Christ, Limbaugh has two fantastic chapters tackling the paradoxes of Christianity. These include: God’s plan of salvation, including the relationship between grace and works; the acknowledgement that we are sinful yet commanded to be perfect; the Trinity, that God is one in essence yet three in persons; that Jesus has two natures, human and divine; that you must give up your life to find it; that Christians are strong when they are weak; that God is sovereign yet humans have free will; that God knows all and is unchangeable, yet we are to pray; that the Bible is inspired yet written by men; and many others. The insights Limbaugh brings to these paradoxes are some of his own, and the best nuggets mined from Christian scholarship that I doubt you’ll find in one place anywhere else. Limbaugh devotes several chapters to the evidence for the Bible, including its unity and reliability as evidenced through history, archaeology, prophecy and science. He debunks several myths and misunderstandings along the way, and then saves his final chapter for what many think is the atheist’s trump card against God: Evil. Many years ago David provided me an “Aha Moment” during one of our very many theological discussions. He said, “Evil really bothers me, but only Christianity has a sensible answer to it.” There’s no question he’s correct. We wouldn’t even know what evil was unless good existed, and real objective good could only exist if God exists. As David explains, evil turns out to be a backhanded argument for God. In fact, evil is the very reason God entered human history in the person of Christ. Only his sacrifice can solve the evil in my heart and yours. David puts it this way: “Don’t be offended by the notion that you must have saving faith in Christ. Don’t assume that God is making you jump through unnecessary hoops. He is the One Who suffered for you. He did this so that you could live. He doesn’t ask you to believe because He is on a divine ego trip, but because He loves you and wants you to latch on to Him in order to be saved from your sins.” I just can’t recommend Jesus on Trial highly enough. Every thinking person should investigate the claims of Christ, who is unarguably the most influential human being to ever walk the earth. If his claims are true (and Limbaugh shows they are), then we won’t be putting him on trial—he will be putting each of us on trial. Only Christ can secure you a favorable verdict.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "Let me start by saying that this man is nothing like some of his other famous family members, which at one time were chunky and obnoxious and now are manicured, face-lifted, teeth-whitened but still too much of a \"know-it-all\" attitude for my taste. In short, I dislike any person (irrespective of their POV) who uses name-calling, wordsmithery, and hand-waving to ward off opponents and make their point or defend their position. I do, however, love the Lord, and any Christian who can fend off the rising tide of neo-atheism that is attacking his church at least deserves a chance to be heard. . This book is something completely different. I was pleasantly surprised by the measured, thoughtful, respectful tone of this tome. This book is compelling, well-researched, and engagingly written. It tells the story of his traditional mid-Western upbringing (complete with Sunday school), his drifting away from the faith when he went to college, and then his rediscovering of Christianity as an adult who \"knew something was missing.\" . At the beginning of the book he shares the tough questions he asked when adrift from Christianity including: Does a mythical god even have a plan for our redemption? How does this god exact justice? How does he draw his creatures closer to him--assuming he cares in the slightest about them? Where is he anyway? I'm not sure he completely answers all of this by the end of the book, but at least the reader knows that he isn't operating on \"blind faith,\" but has asked himself some tough questions about his God and his faith. He further admits that \"without even investigating the Bible as a young adult, I had serious doubts about Christianity.\" I have found this true in my own life and other's too: Virtually everyone I know who is an atheist or anti-theist does not know anything about the Bible's overarching theme--they've just been turned off by religion in general, the \"stifling\" Do's and Don'ts, or the modern misconception that it is a book full of \"stories\" (with some even questioning the historicity of Christ, which almost no scholar--even atheist ones--would do.) . Limbaugh shares with us that the genesis of his faith's rekindling started (appropriately) around Christmas one year when he was visiting an old college friend. Limbaugh shared that he \"just doesn't believe in Christianity anymore.\" His believing friend asked him why and a deep conversation ensued. He friend--much more well-versed in the Bible than he--began to show him prophetic scriptures from the Old Testament that pointed to Christ. Limbaugh shares that he was \"blown away\" and began to realize that \"the Bible was not simply a mishmash of stories, allegories, alleged historical events, and moral lessons. . . For the first time in my life, I began to realize that the Bible had a theme.\" . I won't spoil the read by saying any more except that Limbaugh has quilted together scriptural quotes, historical references, personal insights, and meaningful examples to create a compelling book. He brings a lawyer's keen mind to many of these spiritual age old questions and, in the opinion of this \"juror,\" gives an excellent defense.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "It's interesting to note that so many so-called \"objective\" viewpoints are from Biblical 'scholars' who have made a life of trying to prove the historical existence of Jesus, when in reality, all they have are references from other religious institutions whose agenda is identical to their own. The truth is, our King James Bible is a re-write of the Catholic Bible, of which there have been over 600 revisions in the last 400 years. Their so-called 'evidence' does not stem from any real historical evidence which would include references from outside of the Bible, such as recorded writings from the local Roman government which would have charged Jesus with the intended insurrection of which his fellow Jews accused him. Also, there is no documentation of any tax records, of which all working citizens would have been required to pay, including a working carpenter such as Jesus. As famous as he was, there surely would have been some documentation of his miracles and wonders from some non-religious source. Correct historical verification requires that the same record come from several different sources, and not from several scrolls found in the same cave, and whose texts were written as much as seventy years after the supposed events took place. No one that is a religious practising Christian seems to notice that every single reference they use as 'proof' of the existence of Jesus not only never stems from outside of the Bible itself, but that their other so-called evidence is from 'documentation' that stems from only religious institutions- specifically Christian religious institutions. But you can't dissuade these individuals and their institutions of the most likely reality, which is that a fledgeling Christian church who borrowed heavily from the mythos of previous Greek, Roman, and Egyptian gods and goddesses did what it could to survive, invented the first version of 'Superman', and gave any convert a special magic pass to get into Heaven after death. What was not to love about a religion this easy to follow? There was so much furor over the Shroud of Turin back in the seventies, but carbon-dating proved that the fabric was not older than seven hundred years. They supposedly found the tomb of Jesus' family, but a group of skeletons with no identifying marks like a family 'crest' of some sort, or an Aramaic inscription, it would only be pure conjecture, but we know that the sycophants will take it as 'gospel truth' without having done the slightest bit of real homework other than reading their scriptures, and books that religious scholars have written over the centuries. If we were to take everything they said as fact, then books that were written based on so-called scientific evidence would have 'proven' in the nineteenth century that the black man was inferior both physically and mentally to the white man. The plain truth of the matter is that these books were written by racists, and the Christian religion is based in large part on prejudiced thinking that has become so institutionalized that almost no one in America questions its validity. Is there a God? Almost certainly, every civilization on Earth has a mythos about some sort of Divine Source, and the scientific method of historic verification is more closely followed in this vein due to its universal nature. But if Jesus even existed at all, was he God, or divine in nature? That is another question altogether, and this book can ONLY be the writer's unfounded OPINION of what he thinks is true, simply because it makes sense to him in his religious quest for inner peace. It cannot claim to be the ultimate TRUTH, and if you want that, you will not find it in this book.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "This is a well-written account of Genghis Khan and his successors, the Mongols who conquered an amazing chunk of real estate. Weatherford debunks the nonsense about \"millions\" killed in cities of 100,000, and so forth, and correctly notes a lot of this came from Mongol propaganda intended to scare people into submission. The best thing in the book, to my taste, is Weatherford's own knowledge from anthropological on-the-ground research. He knows the steppe and the feel of a Mongol horse under him. He can thus get a real perspective on how the Mongols actually experienced the world (like the great old-timers--Pozdnyev, Curtin--but unlike many modern Mongolists). Next best is his proper crediting of the Mongols for introducing new knowledge all over Eurasia--gunpowder and printing and much else to Europe, Greco-Persian-Arab medicine and foodways to China. The worst is his inattention to detail. He makes some astonishing errors. Some reviewers have picked out a few. He retails the old chestnut (reportedly from a romantic novel) that the Mongols introduced noodles from China to Europe. No, Europe had them 800 years earlier. Worse is his repeating (p. 87) the old nonsense about the Mongols eating raw meat warmed between their thighs and the horses' backs. This factoid was spun by Ammianus Marcellinus, talking about steppe nomads centuries before the Mongols. It was almost certainly wrong then, and it is quite certainly wrong for the Mongols. The Mongols had the good sense to avoid raw meat, especially dirty raw meat. So, read with caution. If this book whets your appetite, the next step is the books by Paul Ratchnevsky (on Genghis) and Morris Rossabi (on his successors and their world). And you might even tackle the Secret History, now made available (though expensive) by the indefatigable Igor de Rachewilz, who is properly acknowledged by Weatherford.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "When Genghis Khan and his armies exploded out of the steppe in the early thirteenth century, no one on the Eurasian continent was prepared for his innovative style of warfare. Through years of what was essentially civil war, the Mongols of that period, as well as the surrounding tribes, had already refined various elements of shock warfare. But Temujin - Genghis Khan's birth name - added much to the Mongols' arsenal that was previously missing. He integrated surrounding tribes into his Mongol army; he ensured looting was strictly controlled and that shares of it were divided on a pre-assigned basis; he killed off the aristocracies of the tribes, cities, and empires he defeated, thereby ensuring they would not rally their people to turn on him at a later time; he organized his armies, and even his society, through a decimal system that smoothed the functioning of his eventual empire; he instituted laws that even he, a great khan, must obey. What resulted from these innovations was unprecedented: an army with the same benefits of speed and maneuver that had always been a part of the traditional tactics of the tribes of the steppe melded together with an effective bureaucratic leadership that was very different from the typical kin-based and ad hoc tribal relationships. This was Temujin's creation, and he perfected it in numerous battles to unify Mongolia under his leadership. In 1206, two years after the final battle to assume control of all Mongolia, he took the name Genghis Khan, and prepared to take his army out into the world. Jack Weatherford's remarkable narrative of these events captures the creativity of Genghis Khan and the Mongols in a way that no book I've read before ever has. Whereas most histories of the Mongols have long emphasized their unprecedented success in war, Weatherford builds a solid case that shows the social and economic achievements of the Mongols may have been even more remarkable than their adaptations to warfare. The author makes the argument that the Mongols were fairly civilized by the standards of the thirteenth century, almost never engaging in torture, mutilation, or maiming. While they were quick to kill, and left an unprecedented path of destruction in their path, especially to those who resisted their rule, conquest and loot were their goals, not gratuitous death and injury. After making himself the undisputed ruler of the steppes, an area about the size of Western Europe, Genghis Khan began moving south and west, conquering the Jurched (Manchurian) tribes ruling Northern China and the kingdom of Khwarizm, an empire under the rule of a Turkic sultan that stretched from what is modern Afghanistan to the Black Sea. Khwarizm was an important catch, as the Muslims there were noted for their steel- and glass-making, as well as numerous exotic commodities. As each conquest was assimilated, Genghis Khan took what was special and distinctive about the place and employed it productively. Craftsmen, miners, artisans, interpreters, and specialists in warfare were all absorbed into the Mongol Empire and tasked according to their specialty. The Mongols were nomads, but the genius of Genghis Khan was to recognize the value of even the smallest and most foreign of civilized talents and to use it to his empire's advantage. Genghis Khan died in 1227 - a mere sixteen years after he began his world conquest. With the exception of India and China, he had conquered everything he set his mind to. It would now be up to his sons and their children to finish what in the shortness of time he could not. (Genghis Khan dies about halfway through Weatherford's book, leaving plenty of space to write about the continued expansion of the empire.) Interestingly, the empire seems to have expanded more by the momentum of its founder's achievements, even after his death, than by the skill of his heirs. Genghis Khan had always been careful not to give his children too much power, as he sought to break away from the traditional kin-based ties of the steppe in order to more smoothly run his empire. In mediating disputes involving his sons, he sometimes took the side of non-kin against them. Until late in his life, he neglected their training as leaders. The consequences of this became immediately apparent in the actions of his son and first heir to the empire, Ogodei. But, even with sub par and occasionally strife-ridden leadership, the empire continued to expand. Some of the Mongol leaders to follow Genghis Khan were exceptional leaders, while others were not, but the combination of unbeatable virtues in the empire was fixed in a way that it hardly mattered in the first few decades after his death. Nothing outside of the empire could stop it, only enduring struggles from within. As Weatherford details, even as the empire began to split into four quadrants, trade and other imperial activities continued. Two Mongol rulers from separate quadrants could be at war with each other and still allow trade and investments between the sides to continue unmolested. Eventually this relationship would break down, and when it did, it would spell the end of the empire. The Mongols did not create anything. They conquered and looted. And the trade routes needed to move their loot from one part of the empire to another were necessary to keep the empire strong. When those trade routes began to close down, and the economy contracted, the Mongol rulers in each area needed to depend on their local political skills to survive. Some did, but others never made the transition. Weatherford's book is a marvel - the best of more than half-a-dozen histories I have read on the subject. Writing about the Mongols has always been a complex task for two seemingly contradictory reasons. On the one hand, their widespread empire requires a scholar to dig through a variety of source material written by those conquered by the Mongols, which many find daunting; on the other hand, the Mongols themselves were illiterate and secretive, and so their own literature was almost nonexistent and, when found, difficult to understand. Given these odd circumstances, histories on the Mongols are usually hit-and-miss affairs. Scholars tend to be great at explaining some part of the Mongols, but fail to maintain that quality in other areas. Weatherford's extensive experience in Mongolia, researching Genghis Khan and his empire, makes up for what he loses by not going to the source material outside of English; his accomplishment is a narrative of the highest order.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This is a revisionist history (isn't it all?) of a truly remarkable figure, who created an empire greater even than the Romans, and he did it from scratch in just a few decades. He was a law-giver who essentially outlawed the culture he came from--transforming it from a Scots-like clan of cattle rustlers and raiders, to a monolithic, highly disciplined cavalry of conquerers. He devised entirely new military tactics that were as successful against the cities of the Chinese as against the armored knights of the West. And they started out as a people, he claims, who did not even know how to weave cloth! Weatherford here takes up the challenge of accenting the positive impact of his brutal conquests. Among other things he makes the case for his setting the West up for the Renaissance, the introduction of paper money, the postal system, Religious tolerance, and new vegetables. He bases much of this on new scholarship, rather than the hysterical propaganda of the aristocrats whom he threatened. Partly based on the mysterious \"Secret History of the Mongols,\" the author's own travels in Mongolia, and contacts with Mongolian revivalists, he makes this bit of history accessible even to the most prejudiced reader. Strangely omitted, though, is the fascinating tale that the geneticists have discovered about his Y chromosome, which appears to show that he might just have been the most prolific lover in the last couple of millennia! Too recent, maybe. One of the remarkable features of his style was that he hated the elite and the aristocrats, and slaughtered as many as he could. He loved the professional men, the teachers and doctors, and especially the craftsmen and engineers, and did not even tax them. My kinda guy! Weatherford's style of writing is lively and easy to read. The maps are just detailed enough to be informative without overburdening the reader in detail. This is not an exhaustive account of every battle, every city destroyed, which would be mind-numbing history as usually written, but rather a wide survey of events and their impact on the world to come. And I especially enjoyed his description of the military tactics employed by the cavalry, and his use of siege engines and gunpowder, which would be new to most readers. Perhaps one of his greatest inventions, though, is that of diplomatic immunity. Any city, and there were several, who murdered or mutilated his envoys as a method of rejecting his terms of surrender, would be ruthlessly razed and the inhabitants slaughtered. Even in those days, the word got around... This is quite a tale, well told.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "For the most part, I enjoyed this book. I discovered a great deal about the Mongols and I believe that the author proves his basic case that the Mongol Empire provided an unprecedented flow of goods and ideas between East and West. Unfortunately, the author is so enthusiastic about promoting the achievements of the Mongols that he often ventures into hyperbole, and worse, miss-statements of fact, especially about the histories of the nations he is comparing to the Mongols. This undercuts his credibility. Some examples: The author's claims that the Mongol invasions introduced wearing trousers in battle to the West. In fact, trousers were popular among the Celts (including the Britons) for thousands of years, as they were among invading \"barbarians\" such as Goths and the Parthians. The Greeks and Romans wore kilts, but many of their neighbors wore trousers long before the Mongols. The author says that in World War II, the Red Army was imitating the Mongol tactic of feigned retreat when they \"lured\" the German army deep into Russia to destroy it. In fact, Stalin repeatedly ordered his generals to stand fast and not give an inch. The reason the Red Army repeatedly fell back was because they were repeatedly beaten. This is not an esoteric point. How could a professor writing history on a global scale not know this? The author says that the last Mogul Emperor's sons were executed in India so that Queen Victoria could take the Imperial title. This is just plain silly. The Emperor himself was sent into exile with other family members. His sons were executed for their purported roles in the Sepoy Rebellion as part of a bloody reprisal. There is no evidence that the motivation for this was to clear the way for Queen Victoria to assume the imperial title -- 20 years later. There are so many more examples of this kind of factual error and false analogy that at times the book feels more like an overheated term paper by a sophomore stretching a point than the product of a learned professor. Such errors make me wonder how much I should trust the author's other pronouncements in areas that I'm not so familiar with. The fact that the author is also prone to needlessly repeat himself doesnt help his case. He cites the fact that his source is the \"Secret History of the Mongols\" so often that I felt like I should be reading that book instead. Maybe I will", "id": "9"}
{"review": "As Strunk and White advise in the classic guide to writing, _The Elements of Style_, \"Do not overstate. When you overstate, readers will be instantly on guard, and everything that has preceded your overstatement as well as everything that follows it will be suspect in their minds because they have lost confidence in your judgment or your poise.\" I wanted to like this book, because I find Genghis Khan and his empire to be fascinating, and yet the author so completely overstates the significance of the Mongols that he loses all credibility, and pollutes an otherwise highly readable and interesting set of facts with so much fiction that it is often difficult to distinguish the two. For example, he claims in the introduction that the Mongols had founded the first unified nations of Korea and China, apparently ignorant of the fact that Korea had been unified since AD 668, and that China was first unified by the Qin dynasty in 221 BC. Similarly, he states on p. 237 that \"[the Renaissance] was not the ancient world of Greece and Rome being reborn: It was the Mongol Empire, picked up, transferred, and adapted by the Europeans to their own needs and culture.\" Although the evidence for Greek and Roman influence on the Renaissance is overwhelming, the evidence for Mongol influence is flimsy at best. The more outsized the claim, the less evidence the author seems to provide. Furthermore, he tries to give the Mongols credit for inspiring Renaissance art, which he calls a hybrid of Eastern and Western styles; he gives the Mongols credit for disseminating Arabic and Indian mathematics (the Arabs themselves had disseminated Indian mathematics throughout the civilized world, long before the Mongols); he gives the Mongols credit for introducing the compass to the West (the compass was mentioned in Alexander Neckham's De Naturis Rerum, written in 1190, before Genghis Khan had even ventured out of Mongolia); and he gives the Mongols credit for inventing the Silk Road, which had already existed for thousands of years. What the book desperately needs are a fact-checker and responsible editor to curb the author's literary excesses. The author clearly sympathizes with the Mongols and wants to promote their case as responsible bearers of civilization. His biases are so blinding, that he frequently makes irrelevant comparisons to the worst excesses of the Catholic Inquisition to try to justify the mass slaughter of the Mongols, and even tries to deny the scale of Mongol genocides altogether, lamely asserting (p. 118), \"It would be physically difficult to slaughter that many cows or pigs, which wait passively for their turn. Overall, those who were supposedly slaughtered outnumber the Mongols by ratios of up to fifty to one. The people could have merely run away, and the Mongols would not have been able to stop them.\" The gigantic flaw in logic is that the Mongols never faced odds of 50-to-1 at any one moment, but rather wiped out city after city in a process that took many years. His claim the the people could \"have merely run away\" is laughable, given his constant reminders that the Mongol cavalry were the fastest and most efficient army of the day. He could just as easily have applied the same ludicrous argument to any other historical genocide in order to deny their scale and seriousness. I still like the subject of Genghis Khan, and Weatherford has whetted my appetite: I may eventually pick up one of the other, more serious and scholarly books on the topic. However, I will never again make the mistake of reading anything written by Mr. Weatherford.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "This is a well written, nicely flowing work. The author, Jack Weatherford, traces the life and time of Genghis Khan, born as Temujin, and his descendants. He notes the impact of the plague on the Mongols and how that plague spread, to some extent by the Mongols. And he makes the claim that the Mongols had an appreciable impact on the West's Renaissance. Weatherford begins by noting the purpose of his book (Page xxxv): \"The focus remains on the mission of our work: to understand Genghis Khan and his impact on world history.\" The book is in three parts: first, Genghis Khan's rise to power and the development of the Mongol Empire; second, the period when the Mongols became a major world player, until the empire began devouring itself with internecine warfare; third, the effect of the Mongols on the development of modern society. There is a useful genealogy at the start of the book; however, the book would have benefited greatly with an ample supply of maps, so that the reader could trace developments geographically. The book does a terrific job of describing Khan's background--from his youth until he began developing a powerhouse, to his death. His military forces used innovative tactics that baffled his opponents, adapting Mongol warriors' mobility to advantage. The Mongols expanded their sway until--at its greatest point, it was larger than the Roman Empire at its height. It stretched, in 1260, from China to Moscow and Kiev, and to the doorsteps of Vienna, from Baghdad to Samarkand. Weatherford goes on to discuss the Empire after Genghis Khan's death. It continued to function until the combat among his sons led to more and more internal troubles. This depiction of internal problems, again, is well done. It amazes me how detailed is the discussion of people and events from so long ago. However, when he comes to argue that the Mongol Empire sparked the Renaissance and later European history, It appears to me that his grasp exceeds his reach. I am not certain that quoting Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" with references to Genghis Khan (as part of his argument) is compelling. Nonetheless, while I did not find his case so convincing, it did cause me to reflect on important historical issues, and that--in itself--is a contribution. In short, a well done book on the Mongol Empire and its founder. Worth taking a look at. . . .", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Like most authors on this subject matter, WEATHERFORD focused his research of the Mongol military campaigns in the Middle East and the brief but devastating incursion in Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, he too, like other authors, lacked sufficient research on the Chinese campaign, which ended in 1279 under Kublai, and was the lengthiest of all Mongol military campaigns. He also misinterpreted the Chinese campaign in more ways than one, and provided little information in terms of the political interactions between China and Mongolia during the 13th century. The most destructive episode of medieval warfare occurred not in Europe, the Middle East, or the Crusades, but in China proper of the 1200s. Although initiated by Genghis, the Mongol-China War did not end until the reign of Kublai. The campaign included the greatest siege in pre-modern military history, where the fall of the fortified city of Xiangyang in 1273 served as a turning point of the Mongol-China war, and ended with the capitulation of the Sung Dynasty six years later (WEATHERFORD placed a three month siege by the Mongols as being protracted, yet he dismissed the fact that the siege of Xiangyang had lasted six years). Not surprisingly, the campaign drained vast amounts of resources, and millions of lives. The Mongol's China campaign also marked the very first time in history where guns, cannons & other types of firearms were used extensively. Yet, this event in history was ignored by WEATHERFORD, as he focused on the administrative reforms of Yuan China over previous Chinese dynasties, but not the military campaigns that made the reforms possible. WEATHERFORD also ignored the episode of alliance between Southern Sung and the Mongols as they warred against the Northern Chinese dynasties, the Xi-Xia and Jin. Kublai did not complete the conquest of China out of personal ambitions alone. Rather, with the fall of Xi-Xia and Jin, the Sung Dynasty remained a looming threat to the Mongols. As the Sung continue to demand territories and other compensations, the Mongols had every reason to be cautious of a potential Sung attack from the rear. Kublai had to endure extensive campaigns to subdue northern India, South Asia, even launching an invasion against Japan to completely isolate and eventually terminate any supply and/or trade routes the Song Dynasty possessed. All these efforts were considered necessary in order to subjugate then the most powerful empire on Earth, an empire that accounted for 80% of the world's GDP! In another blunt assumption, WEATHERFORD suggested that literacy amongst the Chinese were restricted to government officials and gentries. But in fact, China boasted the most flexible system of social mobility and the most sophisticated bureaucracy in the world during the Middle Ages. The Chinese bureaucracy never imposed a system to limit literacy amongst the peasantry. Whenever given an opportunity, peasant families sent their sons to private academies for an education. Technologies such as block printing also encouraged the distribution of written materials, thus promoting literacy. Voluntary civil examinations across China would then act as a measure of talent amongst learned peoples, where the chosen few are ranked and stationed in bureaucratic posts according to their skill. It is not surprising to find many Chinese officials with humble beginnings. Moreover, WEATHERFORD seemed to imply the rise & subsequent popularity of Peking opera was due to Mongol administration. In fact, the rise of Peking opera was due to educated Chinese having no place to utilize their skills because the Mongols had abandoned civil examination & post selection altogether. Thus one of the few venues for learned men was writing opera scripts and other literature to vent their frustration against the government! WEATHERFORD also wrote that the Chinese were `amazed' at some of the qualities of their enemies in a tone as to suggest that the Chinese were somehow `unfamiliar' with the Mongols. There is nothing further from the truth. The annals of Chinese military history indicated frequent warfare against the Nomads to the North. As early as the Qin Dynasty (221 BC - 207 BC), expeditions were directed against the Huns (ancestors to the Mongols) with notable successes achieved in later Han (202 BC - 220 AD) and Tang (618 AD - 907 AD) dynasties. Conflicts between the Chinese and Mongols continued until the last Imperial Dynasty of China, the Qing (1616 AD - 1912 AD). Among all Mongol rivals, the Chinese Empire had the most familiarity with the Mongols, and nominally best prepared for war against them. No wonder Genghis Khan, upon his deathbed, would instruct his descendants to complete the conquest of China, as his last will on Earth.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Let me start with what I liked about this book. It sums up the two centuries in which Mongols made their mark on the world in a readable, digestible and informative way. Jack Weatherford is an anthropologist so the strongest parts are the first few chapters dealing with Chinggis Khan's tribal origins, his childhood and rise to power. Weatherford apparently spent lots of time in Mongolia, researching Mongol history on the spot and the first half of the book shows that. It describes the steppe life well, provides many interesting details and is just generally fun to read. Sometimes, Weatherford can even be outright funny. But in the second half, the book clearly turns for the worse. Once Mongols leave their homeland and become players in world politics, the book has to become less anthropology and more history and that's clearly not Jack Weatherford's forte. He posits all sorts of causal links which sound either dubious or plain ridiculous (Mongols inspired European renaissance, Columbus sailed to America to search for the Mongol empire etc.). Yet what I found especially inappropriate (and at times almost laughable) was how the author pushes hard to teach us important MORAL lessons through Mongol conquest. For instance, the Catholic Church tortured heretics (as Weatherford often stresses - even in the middle of a passage on the Mongol court, there is an aside about European inquisition) but Chinggis khan never tortured - he killed straight away. What a moral giant! On page 105, we learn that, had it not been for the recalcitrant emir of Bukhara who refused to submit without a fight, Chinggis would have lived out his days \"in peace, enjoying his family and horses.\" See, he was a family man! His ultimate moral point is to fit Mongol conquests in the framework of the eternal struggle between sedentary and nomadic populations and his moral axis is clearly one where sedentary=evil, nomadic=good. Notice, in the following passage, how the blame for aggression subtly shifts as the author cites the cases to support his point: \"[The struggle of the hunter and herder against farmer] ... was a history as old as the story of the Bedouin tribes that followed Muhammad to smash the pagan idolatry of the city, of the Roman campaigns against the Huns, of the Greeks against the wandering Scythians, of the city dwellers of Egypt and Persia who preyed on the wandering tribes of Hebrew herders, and, ultimately, of Cain, the tiller, who slew his brother Abel, the herder.\" (p.266) So there you have it: Chinggis khan was really waging a defensive war against \"the civilized children of Cain, who eternally encroached upon the open lands of the tribes\" (p.267). How the Polish peasants encroached upon the uncultivable Mongol homelands in the Gobi desert is unclear to me, but Chinggis khan & Sons sure made them pay for it at the battle of Legnica in 1241, as Weatherford relates with glee. So, is this book worth the money? The first half is; the second half - read it with a skeptical, cynical, distrustful mind.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Fascinating book, and prior reviewers have summarized it well. My only comment is that Weatherford eulogizes him far too often. His accomplishments came at the expense of those he conquered. Lest we forget.... An army of 200,000 men does not move without supplies across 2,000 miles without living off the local population, for example. Massacre of the ruling class was considered barbaric in the 13th century, but it certainly made his takeover of Pakistan and Turkey simple. His descendents' methods were the inspiration of Nazi Germany, down to their ludicrous adoption of the swastika, for example. Other than that, it is extremely well written and entertaining.", "id": "9"}
{"review": "Jack Weatherford's book is written as if he himself was a Mongol, but he was not. He takes a close look at the impact of Genghis Khan without the distortion of the western or middle eastern eyes and views. Every other book on the Mongols view them as a destructive force with no influence to the history of mankind. However, the author proves this wrong. If you can be objective about history and do your due deligence and accept another's viewpoint, this is a must read. He presents Genghis Khan's legacy as it should be presented. Influences of Genghis Khan: (military: only force to defeat the Russians in winter, something Napoloean and the German could not do; fought the German Knights, the Assasins in the Middle East and the Japanese. All of the 3 did not even know that the other countries existed. Succeeded where the Crusaders could not. Developed the lightning attack at multiple fronts, used psychological warfare, and implemented new military technologies and was quick to adapt to different terrains of the countries he fought in. He promoted officers for their deeds and not for their heritage. (not just military) - he was tolerent of all religions, his sons began a system of free education, he abhorred tortue, recognized international immunity, separated the church from the state, established paper currency, promoted free trade by exchanging ideas and goods across his empire, pushed for the creation of cartograpghy, developed a postal system, and his son's encouraged trade across his empire via sea routes. Some words used today - Hooray and Satin are of Mongol origin. Yes, some of Genghis Khan's impact was cruel but he lived in times of harsh cruelty, even Princes, Kings, Sultan's, Caliph's of his time exhibited even more harsh judgements.

{"review": "At first it might seem dismissive and reductive to call anything \"a bathroom book\", or a \"waiting room\" book, (when was the last time you saw a book in a waiting room, anyway?) but unfortunately, this is the appellation under which most \"factoid\" (or light humor) books must labor. However, were you to relegate this amazing book to your WC, despite the number of flushes you hear in a day, there would always be a line. In the case of \"What If\", this tragic location it is a far cry from what is deserved by the quality of writing, the subject and sense of humor herein. While obviously not having narrative, story or continuity, it has a greater consistency than could be called a topic- humor. OK, two. Humor and patience. Three: Humor, patience, and some amazing research. A disclaimer from Randall Munroe: \"I am a guy who draws pictures on the Internet. I like it when things catch fire and explode, which means I do not have your best interests in mind.\" I was instantly hooked. Further: For the question that warrants a different sort of answer- \"What happens if you set off a nuclear bomb in the center of a hurricane? Would the storm cell be vaporized?\" Munroe has only to quote NOAA as they reply, \"Needless to say, this is not a good idea.\" Unsurprisingly, he cites their entire article. In fact, the text is followed by a goodly section of references. There is no doubt he went the distance on these questions, and did so with a mind to give the most accurate, honest and flat out funny answer possible, in some cases going far over the top than the original question requires. These are the truly great ones. Not to mention, the questions do nothing if but give cause for the reader to sit slack jawed and wonder how they could have been conceived in the first place, let alone uttered aloud. You can read it cover to cover if you, well, can read it cover to cover. I tried- but each question was either so bizarre (\"Is it possible to build a jetpack using downward-firing machine guns?\") or compellingly simple (\"How high can you throw something?\") and answered with equal time, patience and laugh out loud humor that you will not want to miss a page. My copy is already thumb marked and creased from floating around so much. And don't loan it to anyone. Anyone familiar with Randall Munroes's excellent and oft-reposted internet comic, \"xkcd\" (\"A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.\") will not be surprised but quite pleased to have a portable, non-electronic version of one of my favorite parts of Munroe's strip- the reader questions. The website consists of not merely these questions, but strips often based life in general through twisted looks via probability science. Another feature, of course, is the \"What If\" section, from where the rich number of these are drawn. Here are collected what we must assume are the best of these questions, postulating impossible and absurd questions that might, in some other universe, be quite serious. And as best as one can with tongue in cheek, Munroe uses his extensive background in math and physics to give every question the answer, no matter how improbably. An indestructible heater running on infinite power in a sealed one-meter cube- haven't you always wondered? Some are just inexplicable and unanswered \"Weird And Worrying Questions\", perhaps for \"What If Vol II\". But if I had to state a theme, it is that of suffering fools gladly, which the author proves page after page after page. Even though to a scientist, especially a scientist with a great sense of humor, (as the maxim says), \"there are no stupid questions\" I had hoped to find the real answer to some of the questions most famously posed by comedian Steven Wright, maybe 30 years ago, perhaps previously the best known purveyor of same- \"If you are in a spaceship that is traveling at the speed of light, and you turn on the headlights, does anything happen?\" It would not surprise me if this has been addressed already. \"Sponges grow in the ocean. That just kills me. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be if that didn't happen.\" So here's an unlikely comparison, but in fact it was one of my earliest thoughts: Bill Griffith's \"Zippy The Pinhead\" and Munroe's \"What If?\" While the text in Zippy - often the title itself- usually makes a point, or describes the strip or does not seem immediately relevant, it is nothing compared to the artwork, which is usually so subtly stunning few people recognize it as such \"What If?\" and its Internet source, Munroe's fabulous \"xkcd dot com\" is more or less the opposite. The still entertaining artwork is not any big deal (though still informing the comic) but the text is mind blowing. I mean no disrespect to either author- quite the opposite, I am huge fans of both. Randall Munroe treats each question as if it had the gravity (a lot of gravity questions here- sorry) of your typical \"is there intelligent life in the universe?\" (or on Earth, for that matter) yet maintains the attitude of early Bill Cosby- \"Why is there air?\" This is one of the most captivating and thoroughly enjoyable books I have seen in a long time.", "id": "86"}
{"review": "I expected What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe, creator of xkcd, to be an entertaining read. But its fun and knowledge value far exceeded my expectations. One of the best non-fiction books I have read in a long, long time, What If? is a book of science, humor, comics, reference, comedy and trivia. It is an informative and enjoyable as the author has delightfully mixed fun with the hard stuffs which make it almost impossible to put it down. This amazing book of over three hundred pages contains a number of questions that you'd never think of. Yet, reading the questions and answers would make you to sit up and think things you've never thought before. Just sample this: What is the farthest one human being has ever been from every other living person? Were they lonely? Answer: It's hard to know for sure. The most likely suspects are the six Apollo command module pilots who stayed in lunar orbit during a Moon landing: Mike Collins, Dick Gordon, Stu Roosa, Al Worden, Ken Mattingly, and Ron Evans. Each of these astronauts stayed alone in the command module while two other astronauts landed on the Moon. At the highest point in their orbit, they were about 3585 kilometers from their fellow astronauts. Fun, engaging, enlightening and hilarious, this is a must-read book if you want the answer to some weird questions like, Is it possible to cry so much you dehydrate yourself? Or what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light?", "id": "86"}
{"review": "About half (51%, according to the book, which seems about right) of the questions answered in this book are original, and have never been posted on the xkcd what if? website (https://what-if.xkcd.com/). Even though I'd already read the other 49%, I re-read them and was glad I did, as Munroe has added a few things here and there; plus, this stuff is just eminently re-readable. It's the perfect combination of irreverent, rigorous, technical, and fascinating. I look forward to every new \"What If\" (he posts them each Tuesday or Wednesday) and am always delighted to read the latest. Even if you've read every \"What if\" ever posted to the website, this book is still for you - it's especially for you! This is a great way to enjoy older questions and answers over again, updated, and to share them with new people, and the new questions and answers - never featured on the website - are delightful; I won't spoil it for you, but my favorite has to be the answer to \"If a bullet with the density of a neutron star were fired from a handgun (ignoring the how) at the Earth's surface, would the Earth be destroyed?\" If you have even a passing interest in science and ever enjoy daydreaming about the fantastic or the ridiculous, this book is for you. If you don't think that you enjoy those things, this book will prove to you that you do. Also, this is a really great gift idea for basically anyone in your life who can read. Kids will love it, adults will love it (I'm ordering a copy for my dad's birthday), and they will be hooked from the first page (who hasn't wondered what would happen if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning?)

{"review": "This book makes learning a potpourri of scientific factoids fun, buy inserting them into an exploration of what would happen if something that would never happen happened scenarios, which lead sobering, or humorous conclusions. Sprinkled about, there are also some weird (and worrying) questions from the “What if?” inbox. I love the author’s opening disclaimer, which pretty much prepares the reader for to digest the truth that follows, no matter how grim, discouraging, or shocking the outcome. Meticulous research seems to have been used in formulating the solutions to the particular what ifs at hand, with interjections from specialist outside sources, when provided. Cartoon illustrations are provided, of such things as flying bunkers, so that the readers can reinforce their learning with visual aids. The inbox questions break up the action with contemplative asides, the first of which I found to be a truly legitimate concern. I am enjoying my serious scientific answers book, tremendously. It is the perfect book to pick up for a light, and interesting read in small chunks, and readaholics can consume the entire book within a couple of heavy sessions, I’m sure. Some of the theories presented are more entertaining than others, but they can’t all be gems. This is one of those books that you can have sitting around, and anyone whose eye it catches is quite likely to flip to something they find interesting, which may lead to the next one, then you’ll be late for whatever it is you were going to do, because they’ve only got one page left, and so forth. That’s pretty much the way the hypothetical situations are explored in the book, as well, only more scientifically. It is fun reading.", "id": "86"}
{"review": "Best book for scientific, math, astronomy, geology, etc nerds on the planet. This is a collection of the weird questions one is afraid to ask. Then we get real scientific answers from a real scientist who knows his stuff. Advice: If you don't know the basics of science and math, much of this will be beyond you. But Randall Munroe actually makes the most complex scientific situations easily understood. And the humor, much of it dark, is exceptional. There is a little non PC, but in a way that makes the craziest of the PC stuff funny and enjoyable. If I did not know better, I would, based on his humor, think Randall was British, but he is not. Randall was a roboticist for NASA and has an real live asteroid (4942 Munroe) named for him. Randall is the creator of the xkcd comic. If you like xkcd, you will love this book. You can buy a signed copy for more on his website, but I could not wait and got my unsigned copy through Amazon. (It reads nearly the same.)", "id": "86"}
{"review": "Excellent! Randall (online comic artist behind XKCD) delivers in book form as well as he does visually. He tackles silly questions and gives genuine scientifically valid answers. On occasion he allows magic to first initiate something like a baseball being launched at 0.9 times the speed of light from a pitcher's hands, but promptly returns to actual physical rules of the universe. I learned quite a lot (and I have quite an ample scientific background) and genuinely laughed out loud on several occasions. His style of humour just fits perfectly, and he delivers a punchline in a way you'd never expect from a scientific explanation. Just excellent. Anyone with a moderate interest in science should get this book for a really enjoyable read. And it includes plenty of drawings to keep XKCD fans satisfied.", "id": "86"}
{"review": "I really enjoyed this story with its band of zany extras, shameful pasts and family dinners! Ella left her home town in shame and never looked back. She never was anything like what the gossip mongers and rumour mill believed her to be, but then again, she never had a chance. While she loved her mother dearly, she loathed her mother's choices in life. Sadly, soon after she left home for good, her mother had a son that Ella knew anything about until her mother's death. Her brother Cam is big, bitter and bullish. At the age of 13, he met his long lost sister and nothing is as he planned it to be. I enjoyed the angst and the tension between Ella and her brother. Their relationship was real and the time to build a solid foundation just had not been established, even during the past two years. Two years ago, Ella walked into Jake's family bar and set out to prove she was the kind of woman the whole town believed her to be-but instead she proved to be the one woman that Jake Prince cannot forget! I loved that bit. Then, as these two meet up again, work together through the footy training and then hook up, sweet! They really connect on so many levels. That was why, for me, it hurt so badly when Ella kept saying that Jake was going backwards/going back to Huntley/going back to the past. I loved when she finally forgave her mother, herself and came to terms with her past and her role in making the future all that it could be truly. Of course, the footy action is good, the friends are very funny and the smexying is hot and fun. A great read, enjoy!", "id": "23"}
{"review": "This was my first Amy Andrews book and I have to say, I really liked it. Yeah, I was a little confused at first about the whole football thing, but I got it. I liked Ella. She was cute and quirky and it totally worked. She has a reputation in her small town that was totally undeserving. She had a whole lot going on in her life. The last thing Ella needs is Jake back in her life, but sometimes what we want and what we need are 2 different things. Her and Jake were total opposites. Fate can be a mean b*tch. :) But, when Ella strolls back into town, she decides to live up to that reputation and seduce Jake. Loved it!

{"review": "This was an unexpected treat...not my usual type of book, but the description sounded good and the first few chapters drew me in. I like a good story about family ties, especially when the sins of the parents and the past come back to wreck them and cause turmoil in otherwise settled lives. When Ella comes back to town for her mother's funeral and heads straight to the football hero and her once high school crush Jake, she has sex on the brain and intends to get him into bed and erase the painful feelings that the town has brought rushing back to her. Then the story fast forwards to two years later, and Ella comes face to face with Jake again, but she has more on her mind (her rebellious teenage brother, a crazy cast of friends and fighting land developers) and on top of that there is still the past haunting her every move. This was a lovely and sweet story filled with family drama, some hilarious moments, steamy and honest romance and all ends as it should in a satisfying HEA for most people. It was free when I got it and worth the read if you want a good story that is more on the light side. **** 4 **** \"you CAN come home again\" stars", "id": "23"}

{"review": "This is such a fantastic read. I loved Jake Prince the football jock and Ella Lucas the school principal and their romance was so real, so hot, so full of misunderstandings but so satisfying in the end. I loved the secondary romances, the sweet little background romance with Cam and Miranda and the hilariously unlikely connection between Rosie the goth who has handcuffs on her bed head and the adorably straight-laced Simon. Rosie's aunts, the dogs, especially Cerberus and Pete who is Jake's protégé and go-to guy, all create a wonderful backdrop to the romance. It is a story about community, family, loving the people you sort of hate because they are flawed and stuff up. It's about letting go of the past and being pro-active about the future. It's about finding who you are and who you are meant to be within the context of the community and family and the ones, especially the special one, you love. Considering how much I hate football, much more than Ella, I found this book enthralling. The characters are lovable, charming, at times enchanting. I'm so pleased I read this book.", "id": "23"}
{"review": "It’s a classic Amy Andrews story of opposites attract. Ella and Jake are probably as opposite as you can get on the outside. There’s the inside, too, but I’ll get to that. What I love about the connection between these characters is that it is built on a kind of polar opposition which makes them perfect for each other. I’m finding that’s kind of my new favorite watermark of Amy Andrews’ love stories. On top of that, the book is just full of this kind of attraction and the problems that come with it. Take Rosie and Simon, Ella’s best friend and the guy who falls for her. Fantastically opposite. Spectacularly opposite. They’re the kind of opposite Shakespeare would write about. And it works. I’m rooting for Ella and Jake from the moment she walks into the bar where Jake is working. I’m anticipating the agony of watching Rosie and Simon try to navigate their differences (plus, hello, I love that she’s a cougar…sort of). The pairings are just plain well-done. The characters, all of them, have real depth and complexity. What you often find with “opposites attract” novels is a kind of complete and total difference inside and out. Not so with these characters. I think one of my favorite things about this novel is how intrinsically Ella and Jake match on the inside. Their desires, their drive, and their dreams are relatively the same if not completely the same. Life hasn’t been easy for either of these characters. All the characters are at a mature enough age and emotional seasoning that it’s not just about physicality (though, hoorah, there’s plenty of that) or the novelty of real love. The subtlety that Andrews uses to paint these characters is the perfect touch to draw the reader in. I am completely 100% in support of Ella and understand her hesitance, fear, and attraction. But I also recognize that she’s being a complete dunce when it comes to Jake. And I don’t hate her for it either. These characters are real enough to compel understanding. There’s no too-dumb-to-live heroine here. Just a woman who struggles with her own identity and the emotional undercurrents that her identity rests on. The issues are equally serious and whimsical at the same time. I love a good laugh. I love a good cry. Rarely do I find those two things wound together in one book (or done well for that matter). Holding Out For A Hero is now going to be one of my favorite books because it does exactly that. There are these fabulous characters that are richly drawn who dabble, like real people, in the deeply rooted issues of life (read: family relationships, financial problems, self-respect, sexuality, etc) and, often at the same time, reason through them with everything from coping mechanisms (read: budding alcoholism for better or worse, curry dinners, and feeding notices happily to dogs) to whimsical fancy. I’m pretty sure if Iris and Daisy, Rosie’s aging Aunts and ex-Carnies, weren’t padding through this book with their Tarot cards and sweepstakes chandeliers hanging over toliets, I wouldn’t be half as in love with this story. To top it off? I laughed out loud several times and, in turn, my muscles tensed up while I fretted with the ends of a throw. Anytime a book creates a physical response in me, I’m absolutely delighted. The writing is delightfully sexy and entertaining without going overboard. I was frequently drawn in by Andrews’ ability to engage an intense sexuality without going overboard. I often read scenes in novels that paint their heroines as just this edge of slutty and oversexed. Not so much with Ella (or even Rosie who is arguably kinky). If anything, Ella’s sexuality is comfortable and engaging to read about. A difficult feat for any author. Trust me, the book is sexy. I’m pretty sure I could pick Jake’s butt out of a line-up and I don’t feel the least bit perverted for it, either. I was pulled through each chapter easily, telling myself ‘just one more’ until I was up far later than I had intended. What can I say? Not only is this book worth a read, but I simply must own a print copy now. Buy it like it’s going out of style people! Disclaimer: An ARC copy was provided.

{"review": "Amy Andrews is a Mills & Boon ModernTempted stalwart, and writes utterly charming and delightful spicy romances – so when I was sent a review copy of her new Moonlight Momentum book, I was rather psyched. Holding Out for a Hero’s more edgy than her Mills & Boon fare and I like it all the more for that. There’s Ella, a school teacher whose out-of-character night of passion comes back to haunt her; her best friend Rosie – whose on-off relationship with blue-collar boyfriend Simon is enchanting, hysterical and really fun – and Rosie’s two carnivalesque aunts Iris and Daisy who are beyond awesome. There are a couple of things that I really loved about this book. First of all, the motorbike. Ella heads back to the town she fled on a motorbike. A motorbike. I love motorbikes. And the fact that this woman steps out of her comfort zones in oh so many ways – she sets up a football team to save her school; she faces up to her mother’s past could have a negative impact on her own career; and she heads back into town and demands the hottest sex with the steamiest of alpha males – Jake Prince. Also, she gets landed with a teenage younger brother. I think in some ways, the dichotomy of being an older sister and also having to be Cameron’s guardian, manages to capture the frustrations that are always present in sibling relationships. I’m twelve years older than my younger brother who – despite his ability to drive me round the bend – I adore. And I think this lies at the heart of this novel. Andrews’ ability to capture the ups and downs of familial relationships has never been in doubt, but here it adds a depth to what is essentially a love story. It’s about the triumphs and struggles of a relationship that seems very real – despite the large stage on which it plays out.", "id": "23"}

In our modern, technological world full of computers and smart phones sometimes it's a relief to take a break from typing or texting to fall back on an old and simple idea like tongue twisters. These are just strings of words that don't easily go together soundwise that you have to try to say as fast as you can. The results can be hilarious. Getting a group of kids together to try to say tongue twisters can provide them with great amusement. A competitive element can be introduced to enhance the enjoyment, and sometimes a young person who is no good at sports or school work will discover a hidden talent for tongue twisters that raises his or her self-esteem. They also have more serious uses. For those whose native language is not English, they can provide excellent practice in pronouncing consonant and vowel sounds. Children with speech difficulties can also use them for practice when alone, and they may play a part in training young singers so that lyrics are heard more clearly. And it's not just kids who love tongue twisters. They also make excellent ice-breakers for work gatherings or seminars, and are more sedate than most drinking games for parties. So the next time the power goes, or you find yourself stuck in a room with a bunch of kids or adults you have to keep entertained, why not get them all to have a go at saying some tongue twisters?", "id": "86"}

While this ambitious journey has been undertaken by many others, none have done it in quite the same way as George and Ben. Because, you see, they begin with nothing. Well, not quite nothing, they each have a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts (and George later confesses, a camera, a notebook, a pencil and stack of cards containing the words \"I am OFFICIALLY a very nice person.\") Over three weeks in September, with a vow to spend no money they wander their way north like the maddest of monks on the most quixotic of quests. What they find along the way is a country filled with very interesting people, a great number of whom are very nice. Ben and George manage, through charm, wit, fast talking and willingness to do tasks ranging from cleaning, to loading onions to singing for their suppers, to acquire clothes, food, bicycles and someplace to sleep every night. It is a wonderful adventure and very, very funny. George is a great observer of life and a very witty writer and he and Ben bicker throughout the journey in the way that only true friends can. A few quotes will give you the flavor of this delightful book: `Yeah. There's a place called Neilston in another ten miles.' `Ten miles? Are you kidding me?' asked Ben. `Err, no. It doesn't look like there's anything else before there anyway. We've done really well today. I reckon we'll have done over 90 miles.' `WHAT? My god, you are such a slave driver. If I'd known we had done anything near that much, I would have stopped for the day ages ago.' `I know. That's why I didn't tell you.' ----- Before eating the sandwiches we tried a rendition of Silent Night in German that I could still remember from primary school. A guy on a bmx, in his mid thirties, approached with a small paper bag from Greggs. `Hi guys. You can have these two donuts if you promise to stop singing.' `You've got yourself a deal. Thanks, mate,' I said. ----- The descent from Kirkstone Pass was undoubtedly the fastest I have ever been on a bike. It was possibly the fastest that man has ever travelled, in any form of transport. If The Falcon had had wings, I swear she would have taken off. It was one of the scariest, but most exhilarating things I have ever done. Braking wasn't really an option for me, as The Falcon's brakes only had any slight effect when travelling at a ridiculously slow speed, or uphill. I just gave in and let The Falcon do what she was best at doing - not stopping. ----- We explained our challenge and asked if there was anything we could do in exchange for some free food. `Oooooh, what do you reckon, Jan? Should we give these two strapping young lads any food?' she said to her colleague. `Yeah, why not. If that one with the skimpy shorts shows us a bit more leg,' she laughed. `That'll be you then, George,' said Ben. This was a new low. I was being made to flaunt my body in exchange for food. I felt used. I felt cheap. I liked it. I lifted up the side of my skimpy blue shorts, and exposed my flabby white thighs. `Phwoooooaarr,' said both ladies... ----- If a nutritionist had analysed what we ate during the bike ride, I think they probably would have concluded that we should not be alive, let alone fit enough to cycle. I read somewhere that beige food is bad for you. Almost everything we ate was a shade of beige; bread, pasta bakes, chips, pasties and bananas. Anyway, all I'm saying is that peas and carrots taste unbelievable if you only eat beige food for 17 days beforehand. Give it a try. ----- Free Country is one of the funniest books I've ever read and it is a book that celebrates the tremendous kindness that exists in the world. George and Ben completed their journey thanks to the kindness of strangers, but after reading the tale of their journey, I feel that I owe them much more than the meager cost of this book for the laughter and wisdom I've found in its pages. George and Ben, if you ever make it to Issaquah, look me up. I'll make sure you've got a good meal and a place to stay.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "George Mahood writes with an engaging style, the adventure is preposterously wonderful, and the book is a fun read. I knocked off a few stars for the vulgarity, and as the writing gives witness to the author's delightfully wide vocabulary, I saw no need for so much of it. He includes a little too much information about pain in his private parts as well--it was his choice of bicycle seat, after all. I also grew weary of his calling Ben a wuss so frequently when Ben pedaled just as far on a donated bike, put up with all George's rules, and slept and ate under the same conditions. Both of these young men possess a great sense of adventure, as well as a good supply of creativity, charm, humor, and incredible perseverance. My hat is off to both of them, and with the exception of the few details mentioned above, I recommend the book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Without duplicating the comments of other reviewers, let me just say that the book gives you a feeling for the real Britain and has some laugh-out-loud passages. And the Kindle edition is fairly priced (other publishers, take note). It will help American readers to know a few British terms. Right from the first sentence, you need to know that British pants = American underpants. British trainers = American sneakers. I had to look up \"chip butties\" (French-fry-and-ketchup sandwiches, which restores my faith in British cuisine). As for Ben's ill-timed remark that he will \"roger\" Mrs. Rogers, you can look that one up yourself ...", "id": "2"}
{"review": "Many great travelogues have at their centre a streak of insanity - what made this couple uproot from cosy Surrey and start keeping bees in Roumania? What made this family of seven want to sail the Pacific Ocean in a dinghy? `Free Country' takes this insanity to a whole new level - two barmy Brits decide to bike-ride the full length of the UK, from Land's End to John O'Groats, in just three weeks - with no clothing (except the boxer shorts they stand up in), no food, no money...and no bikes. \"Why??\" you might ask.\"What special kind of madness is this??\" The simple answer is: `to prove the kindness of strangers.' Britain is not broken, the author (and friend Ben) have us believe. We are not a nation that has lost sight of basic values of humanity and kinship, there lies within everyone the desire to help others. And so the plucky twosome plunge into their 1000 mile journey without money and provisions, relying entirely on the mercy and generosity of strangers to get them through. Starting out with one trainer and half a pair of socks, graduating to a pair of wellies four sizes too small and six pairs of the biggest socks in existence, the pair acquire a scooter and a mini BX and are on their way! What follows is the road trip to end all road trips - a kind of Around the World in Eighty Days meets Around Ireland with a Fridge - with a bevy of colourful characters (crazy, pizza-tossing Arek, even crazier phone-freak Roobals, Glastonbury-legend Michael Eavis) and, for me at least, a belly-laugh on practically every page. My favourite line? `It is bloody cold and windy on the top of a mountain in a pair of silky shorts and a T-shirt.' Well yeah, it must be!! I was genuinely sad when the dustbin-diving duo, having slept in a cling-filmed polytunnel, a hitman's sitting room, and a stable with an unexpected \"Surprise\" in it (and having survived on pic n'mix and `beige' food for 18 days) finally approached the finish line. I was hoping they might microwave another pair of underpants.", "id": "2"}

{"review": "This book is a joy from start to finish. Follow George and Ben on their outlandish adventure to complete the famed End-to-End journey starting out with nothing more than two pairs of novelty boxer shorts and a crazy idea. The author and his pal are committed to completing the 1000-mile trip from Land's End to John O'Groats without spending a single shilling. Throughout this unique and often laugh-out-loud funny travelogue, readers meet a colorful array of people and see a part of Britain far off the bustling tourist trail. Drawn by the subject matter and the novelty of the approach, I was immediately taken in by George Mahood's fine writing and classically British self-deprecating humor. Having cycled from London to Edinburgh and back a few years ago myself under rather different circumstances, I was reminded reading this book of the beauty and majesty (and hills) that await cyclists interested in making the journey. As an obsessive cyclist in search of long distance adventure, I am inspired to make the same trek (albeit with a nicer bike and far more gear) myself someday. The book has broad appeal, however, and rarely devolves into cycling minutiae so it is equally appealing to non-cyclists. In fact, I think it's fair to call George and Ben non-cyclists despite their accomplishment. While I won't give away the ending, I will say that it's nearly impossible to finish this book without developing a bit more hope for the human race. This book is a delight. Treat yourself. It's a bargain at twice the price.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "This is a joy to read. Plenty of oddball characters, mishaps, and even some tension, but for the most part this is a hilarious romp through a world of wonderful people. While Ben isn't in the same league as the epic Katz from A Walk in the Woods, the friendship and travails and even disputes of Ben and the author are what keep the story going. The only downside is that, being British, the author occasionally makes references to things which non-Brits might not get. They are infrequent, and you can pick up the meaning even if the reference passes you by. There are dozens of other positive reviews, I just wanted to make note of the fact that you will feel much better having read this book.", "id": "2"}

{"review": "Finally! A fresh voice in contemporary romance. Game, Set, Match by Nana Malone is a delightful, sexy story with well-written characters and an entertaining storyline. The heat between old flames, Jason and Izzy, is obvious from their first encounter. They volley witty dialogue and calculated innuendos at each other like a fast-paced tennis match, and you're never sure who's going to win. Both characters have scarred pasts that cause them to make mistakes in the present, but they're also both determined to learn from that damaging past and move on. From the first page, Izzy's personality grabbed me. She's a workaholic mother who'll do whatever it takes to protect and guide her foster son, Nick, a boy she loves just like her own. In the process, she's forced to deal with Nick's birth mother, a drug addict who cares about no one but herself. Izzy also has to deal with the fact that the odds of a single, black woman being allowed to adopt a white boy are slim to none. But Izzy faces each problem with grit and determination, and under her don't-rock-the-boat demeanor, she wrestles with insecurities and self-doubt, just like the rest of us, often paying the price of putting everyone else ahead of herself. She's most at home behind her camera, where she sees others for who they really are and she can keep her own real self hidden. The fallout from Jason's bad boy image reflects on many current issues in our culture. Ms. Malone does a wonderful job of showing him as both a public superstar and as a private person dealing with his dual images. His charm and talent were both obvious, but his inner turmoil was the most appealing aspect of his character. The sexual tension between Jason and Izzy, along with the blackmail plot surrounding Nick, builds and builds to a delicious and satisfying conclusion. Game, Set, Match is a wonderful new addition to my romance library that I'll read again and again.", "id": "23"}

{"review": "Izzy Conners has been raising the now teenage Nick, pretty much his whole life. Although not his birth mother, he has lived with her and she has cared and loved him as if he was her own. Sabrina, Nick's biological mother has issues of drug abuse and dropping off the face of the Earth at convenient times. Izzy is acting currently as a foster mother, never being able to convince the courts to proceed with adoption. Izzy often wonders if it is because she is black, and Nick is white - but the courts say mothers and children should always be tried to kept together. Fifteen years ago, Izzy and the now tennis superstar Jason Cartwright were friends - and maybe even a little more. But they lost touch - until now. Izzy has been scheduled to photograph Jason for Sports Illustrated. Jason is currently on the sidelines with a knee injury, but that doesn't mean he is still not in the public eye. They reunite and there are definitely some sparks. But, Izzy is in a relationship with her manager Simon, although what Izzy feels the first five minutes she is with Jason is 100% more than what she has ever felt with Simon. As they work together, their attraction flares. But life likes to throw curveballs, and this one comes in named Sabrina. Nick's birth mom, and former lover of Jason has come back home. No one wants her there, but she causes trouble nonetheless. Izzy wants to do everything right for Nick, and Jason wants to prove to her he is more than just a playboy gossip tennis star. Game Set Match is a pretty straight forward story of two people reuniting and working around adult, real life problems to make their relationship work. Izzy's number one priority is Nick. Everything else goes on the back burner. So when Sabrina comes back to town, Izzy's fear that she will take him away overwhelms her. She struggles with balancing her feelings for the three men in her life - Jason, Simon and Nick. I like that her and Jason already have a past, and they ended on not the greatest note, so they have an immediate trust issue. They not only face internal conflict with Sabrina, since they both have a connection to her, but the external conflict with paparazzi puts even more pressure on their friendship and eventual relationship. Izzy comes across a little too perfect for me. She is the perfect mother to Nick, and overall I wanted her more flawed. She treats everyone so nice and kind and never says or does the wrong thing. I wanted her to have something more - something that made her stand out in the book. Paired up with Jason, their relationship becomes quite steamy and Nana Malone does give us lots of romance in this book. It all flows smoothly and nothing is rushed. Nick and Jason are definitely more interesting characters. It was fun watching Jason deal with winning Izzy back and trying to keep Sabrina out of his life. For a teenager, I think Nick is portrayed well. He came across with his immature moments, not always handling the stress of his life well. Overall, this is a light and easy read, although a bit predictable. Between the villain Sabrina (who gets off way too easy at the end) and the complications she brings into the story, there were no big twists delivered to the reader. But it will hold your interest and and Izzy and Jason have nice chemistry together. Rating: 3.5/5", "id": "23"}
{"review": "I do count my pennies and hesitated on spending the amount requested for this ebook, but decided it would be my splurge for the month. It was an enjoyable read and I thought Jason's character was allowed to evolve and grow naturally. Izzy, well, I was surprise she didn't have a breakdown trying to keep everybody happy and holding so much in. She didn't make it easy for Jason and I was please that her son had her back. The friends connection was not left hanging and was funny. As for Sabrina and the coach: never give up YOUR bedroom and way too much patience in handling the coach. I would recommend this story--it was fresh, no shaky plot, the sex scenes were good, and the ending was so sweet.", "id": "23"}

{"review": "I recently read \"Sexy in Stilettos\" by this author and really enjoyed it. So, when I saw that she had another contemporary romance offered on Kindle I immediately bought it. Though this story was well written, fairly entertaining, funny, and sexy at times, I had a kind of indifferent feeling about it when I was done. At first I couldn't put my finger on it, because as I noted previously it had many of the needed elements for a good chick lit/rom-com. But, as I think about it now the main reason had to be because of the heroine, Izzy. She was too nice and forgiving when she didn't need to be, and too mean when she didn't. I really couldn't figure her out. She snapped at Jason and got mad at him for things that she probably should not have, but had taken at least 10 years of abuse from Sabrina, who admittedly didn't even like Izzy. Her hot and cold behavior with Jason was mildly irritating, and her martyr like existence as a foster mother to Nick was confusing. So, while I techinally liked the story, and thought it was more than OK, it wasn't really a 4 star read either...so 3 1/2 it is. If you really want to see what this author can do I would suggest checking out \"Sexy in Stilettos\".", "id": "23"}

{"review": "This book had me laughing out loud - on the bus, in the park - I though people would think me nuts! Joan Rivers is the funniest comedian out there.

If you already LOVE Joan Rivers (as I always have), you will not be disappointed. And if your unfamiliar with her - where have you been? You too will LOVE this book.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I read the book a few weeks ago and was entertained for the night. While some of the humor pressed uncomfortable boundaries, I would push past the things I didn't find particularly funny until I found a \"day\" in her life that made me smile at her keen observations. Isn't life like that, though? Our years are filled with all different things, like a smorgasbord that we can pick and choose, and return to savor. I really liked Joan Rivers. Reading her book, was like a window into her fast paced world. The daily observations dragged me though her hectic schedule, the things that ticked her off, and the people she loved. I always knew I liked her. After all, she has been in my living room dozens of times throughout my life from the time I was a little girl. Joan Rivers was only a year older than my mother. I remember rooting for her when she bravely tried to restart her life after it was shattered by the loss of her husband and her career at the same time. I watched as she reinvented herself in a hostile male dominated environment, creating a whole new industry of red carpet interviewers. It's hard to start over when you're looking at the backside of fifty, competing with fresh young faces. I admired that she always included her daughter, sharing her success and making it a family affair. It's hard to work with family, and they were gracious to each other. Lastly, I bless her for showing that older women can be important, productive, beautiful, and useful in our youth obsessed society. Joan Rivers was a first class act, who lived by her own example. While she did sometimes say something that made me squirm,(Yes, the Ann Frank parts were not my favorite), she was groundbreaking in her humor. So, if I had so suffer with one or two jokes that didn't work, the rest was worth it.", "id": "2"}
{"review": "I have always enjoyed watching Joan Rivers on television and liked her brand of comedy. She is one of the outstanding standup comedians of our time. She is politically incorrect and jabs at anyone who deserved to be made fun of. In this book she pokes at about 135 celebrities that include Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's lavish wedding; Lena Dunham's fondness for flashing; Gwyneth Paltrow's irritability and Anne Hathaway's teeth. Once she was asked if she ever thought that the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president. She replied, \"We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.\" Rivers has been criticized on numerous occasions for making jokes that are insensitive. She was criticized for making jokes about singer Adele's weight. Following the birth of Adele's son in 2012, Rivers said \"Congratulations to Adele on the birth of her 68 pound 8 ounces bouncing baby boy.\" Rivers jokes about women like Miley Cyrus is very funny.

{"review": "I'm a big fan of Joan, I even saw her live this past fall and she was great. Nothing in the book offended me, but she never does. I took a star off, however because while there were a lot of funny lines, there were too many. The pacing of a comedy show and Fashion Police are faster than books so outlets like that are better for line after line. I felt at times she was trying too hard to make so many \"one liners/punch lines.\" Telling some funny stories about LA life or something would have been better along the way instead of going for the quick shot at some celebrity. Some of the topics she had touched upon in other books and would go back too, such as Anne Frank and I found myself thinking \"move on\"; again nothing offended me, but I felt like some points had been already made and she was just over doing it/running some jokes into the ground. I can't believe I forgot to add my favorite part! In the very beginning she dedicates the book to Kanye West using his statement about not being into reading because books/novels \"be wordy\", so from the start you know it's going to be good. But it could have been better and it should have been because I expect more from the talent she has.", "id": "2"}

When JR's daughter Melissa gave her a diary for a Christmas gift, she could only think of was Anne Frank, which Joan couldn't emulate in the slightest bit. Each entry begins with \"Dear Diary\", JR covers all topics from pop/celebrity culture, travel, vacationing from Los Angeles, New York, trips to Mexico, many religious faiths, current events, and a favorite: the LGBT community! It was also surprising how much JR disliked \"Flo\" of the Progressive Insurance Co. JR commented she hoped Flo would be run over by an uninsured driver! At over 80 years of age, JR is still on top of her game. Not hesitating to chastise 79 year olds to \"respect\" their elders, she confesses an affair with FDR, a \"rough rider\", and claims everyone knew she and Abe Lincoln were an item as well! Although she readily admitted the \"Dead Sea\" was named after her sex life. In writing of her decision to become \"Reverend Joan\" through the non-denominational Universal Life Church she performed a ceremony uniting her good friends Lenny and Denny in marriage. Chaz Bono now identifies as a transgender man, JR perplexed; wondered what would happen if she identified as a \"coffee table\"? Considering a lesbian cruise, JR wasn't sure about those finding Antonin Scalia, Martina Navratilova, and 3/4\" drill bits funny. I loved this immensely entertaining funny book! On a more serious level, I'd also like to mention JR's (1997) inspirational bestselling book; \"Bouncing Back\".

{"review": "This story had a l ot of potential. However there were just too many things that got on my last nerve. I liked the hero altho he was just a little bit into taking care of his mother. And the heroine, what a sap. For someone who was suppose to be on the top of her game career wise, she seemed a bit childish to me. Doesn't know her own mind and then when she thinks she does, doesn't have the balls to stand up and act on it. The best friend got on my last nerve. I really hate people that think they know what is best for you and pressure you to do as they say. Plus she was a lot childish in her thinking process. And she shows up on her best friend's honeymoon and can't understand why the friend is not overjoyed to see her. DUH. I got so irritated at these characte3rs that I quit reading about 3/4 of the way through. Another big issue I had was the hero is from an old Spanish family, generations of land owners. They didn't seem to have a problem with her being a non Catholic!! And then she wants to get her marriage set aside after sleeping with him for several days straight. One, I doubt it would be that easy in a Catholic Spain to set aside a marriage that easy and that it could just be done by showing up at the proper authorities. Maybe you can but I don't think so. This one was just not for me. I like a strong hero and a heroine with a brain and spine. This gal had neither. The hero had the best line when he said that if his bride could be so easily persuaded by her best friend then maybe she was not for him after all. Good thinking fellow.", "id": "23"}
{"review": "I suspect it’s meant to be the first installment in a series. The couple focus in this one is on Jessica Bloom and Fernando Garcia de la Vega and takes place mostly in La Esperanza del Corazón in Spain. My Take Cute and short enough to be a novella at 189 pages. It also has some odd problems. It's cute in that Jess gets married on a whim — or is it a subconscious desire? — to the businessman-cum-matador she has been negotiating with for the past six months over the acquisition of his telecommunications business. There’s a codicil in his paternal grandfather’s will that puts a deadline on Fernando to ensure the family’s continuing. And then we learn that the rancho is from his mother’s side of the family while the techcomm business appears to be his own venture. So what he’d be losing…I don’t know. There’s the disconnect between Jess not having paid attention to her faith for years, and Fernando thinking she’s religious. All interspersed with the silly tropes of Jess telling Fernando she doesn’t want him and then being pissed because he finally accepts what she’s telling him *eye roll*. Then what’s with the scene in the bullfighting ring? Jess is supposedly intelligent and yet she can’t seem to make that mental connection between bull-in-ring-about-to-charge-her-husband and the fact that he probably needs to concentrate on the more immediate danger? Duhhh… Another reason to question her I.Q. is how slow she is to pick up on the Gemini comment. For all that, there’s surprisingly little conflict. Yes, I know it’s there in Fernando wanting to stay married and Jess not wanting to. In Jess’ own internal debate. But it’s not really there. You’ll see what I mean if you read this, as everything is la-la land. I suspect the story conflict is supposed to be why Fernando wants this marriage as well as Jess’ experiences in the past. The first is bypassed quickly and the story concentrates on Jess’ issues. The rancho is worth two billion dollars with vineyards, desert, and bulls raised for the ring with poor villages? What’s with the flipping back and forth between using Spanish and then not using it? Fernando requests dos café of an old family retainer, and she responds with a query about two.

{"review": "Disclaimer: I won a preview of this book from Goodreads, yay! This was a sweet little novella. The characters were all super likeable, and I felt that the author reallly avoided several of the cliches that are kind of prominent in romance books. And didn't have to suspend disbelief too much (which I typically find in romance books too) It must be a fine line to draw as an author, because we all want the HEA, and there aren't that many ways to have conflict and tension while still ending up with the HEA. My only real complaint--it was too short, and actually felt somewhat rushed. Especially the ending. But I'd recommend for a quick one-day read to put a smile on your face.", "id": "23"}

{"review": "When I began teaching three years ago, I was required to teach this book. Having never read it before, I began reading it just before our winter break. As I soaked up the story of the book, I realized my students were already living it. They begged me daily, \"Ms. Hill, why do we have to read this stupid book? Can't we just watch the movie?\" As I got deeper and deeper into the book, I grew increasingly depressed about the future of the world. Then I realized: Bradbury has given me a picture of what might be, if we are not careful. His book written nearly fifty years ago peers just twenty minutes into the future now. Technological developments he had no name for then are very real today. For example, his seashell radio is clearly the walkman many of us see pressed in the ears of teenagers daily. TV screens are growing larger and larger and flat screens with HDTV are on the market now. The next step is clearly the full wall television of Mildred's parlor. Robot dogs like Aibo are just a hop skip and a jump away from the dreaded hound. But this is a future preventable. Maybe. But if popular culture is constantly valued above thoughtful consideration and education, we'll march right into a land of burning books and intellectualism on the run. Bradbury's book made me feel defiant. They could never take my books from me. They could burn me with them if they want, but that's what it'll take before I give up my freedom to think for myself. And as for my students, they remind me every day what an uphill battle I have been sent to fight.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "This book is absolutely amazing. It describes a time in the future where censorship prevails and minds are caged. Nobody has original thoughts; with the abolishing of books creativity was lost as well. Guy Montag, the protagonist, is a fireman (firemen burn books in this story) who has to fight to pull himself from the grip of an overpowering government and tradition, only to see that it is all useless (why teach to people who can't understand?). The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and why individuals must not accept the norm without questioning its integrity and implications. Overall, read this book immediately and apply what you learn from it into everyday life. By the way, ignore all of the reviewers that gave the book a low score because they could not understand the plot and symbolism. Their comments are similar to saying Shakespeare's works are poorly written because he uses odd vocabulary and the plot is too complex. Unfortunately, these people make of the mass of society, which is why these reviews are commonplace. (The funny thing is, the novel specifically targets these kind of people...)", "id": "17"}
{"review": "\"Fahrenheit 451\" is a simply great book. Yes, it's quite distressing and unpleasant to read - because what Bradbury describes is much closer to truth than we'd like it to be. And that is precisely what makes the reality of the book so alike our own - it's more pleasant not to think about such things, and therefore one can merely say the book doesn't suit one's taste and go 'get entertained' in front of the TV. The disturbing thing about the book is that, unlike many other books that deal with the distant future, \"Fahrenheit 451\" (written in 1953) hasn't been proved wrong simply by time itself. Not at all. Actually, what is shocking to realize is that we've come quite close to the society Bradbury writes about. Perhaps books haven't been banned yet, but it is indeed the entertainment industry that controls people's minds, the political correctness has reached ridiculous levels, there are ads everywhere and now we even have Segways so that we don't have to walk anywhere... And, of course, we can get a thousand page long classics shortened to a hundred pages - or, better yet, simply watch the movie. The book also has other qualities besides making one think (which is, judging by some other reviews, one of its biggest downsides). One cannot but admire the brilliant way Bradbury uses absurd and creates a completely surreal feeling by using the methods of expressionism to describe the feelings and thoughts of the main character. Bradbury sure had things to write about - and that can be proved by even something as simple as the fact I've spent the last half an hour writing a review on the Internet rather than reading a good book or looking at the world...", "id": "17"}
{"review": "I read this book about 18 months ago, but I am writing a review now because the book came up during a mealtime conversation. We talked about how prophetic a very good science fiction writer can be. This is definitely the case in Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag lives in a world that represses freedom of speech, creativity, and the core of human spirit. People, including his estranged wife, are drones glued to these pseudo realities in television. It describes senseless trivia shows (can anyone say \"Who wants to be a millionaire?\") and awfully realistic soap operas that his wife affectionatly refers to as the \"family.\" What is most disturbing is that as televisions and technology become more \"artificially intelligent\" we will face some of the brainless drivel (we already do) that the major media networks provide us. As a fireman, Guy Montag starts fires with books as the culprit - rather than putting them out. The idea is that books can make some people feel bad and as a result we should get rid of them - in other words books can be controversial and our country does not need disputes. The enforcer is a mechanical dog (which I found a little unrealistic and distracting) that injects a lethal poison into any opponents. Despite the silliness of the mechanical dog - the underlying theme is fantastic - open your mind and save the beauty of spontaneity and creativity of the human spirit.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "It was a pleasure to burn. So begins, with this absolutely perfect opening line, Ray Bradbury's celebrated exposition of the dangers of censorship. Everybody knows that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about book-burning, but this story goes much deeper than those not having read it may suspect. Its message truly does become even more germane and prophetic with every passing day. The skeleton of the plot is rather basic, really. Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to burn books and the houses in which these dangerous manifestations of inane scribbling reside - usually hidden. No one even remembers a time when firemen actually put out fires. We join Guy's life as he enters into a cusp of uncertainty. He has dared to pilfer a book here and there and stash them in his house, a most dangerous crime indeed. He soon meets a free-spirited teenager who breathes life into his state of uncertainty and opens his mind to brand new thoughts and possibilities. When she makes him admit that he is not happy, his life is changed forever. He can't take the lack of substance all around him, the wife who thinks of nothing but \"the family\" (a type of interactive programming that dominates the living room), the impending war which everyone essentially ignores. He knows there must be something else in life, and he comes to believe that the enlightenment he is after must surely be contained in books. Montag's conversations with his Fire Chief on this subject are quite astounding and revealing, and between this and Montag's friendship with an old former professor, we learn how Montag's world came to be this way. The government did not simply ban books overnight. Censorship started slowly and at low levels. Some minority group complained about this - deleted; another group complained about that - gone; these fellows over here object to so-and-so - zip. So many little pieces of books were removed that, over time, the very essence of books was destroyed. While the government has now come to insist that reading books is a crime, the horrible truth of the matter is that the society itself, in its fractious ways, is the party responsible for this tragic state of affairs. Can there be a more timely topic for our own time? We continually see history books being rewritten, \"objectionable\" words, phrases, and (horror of horrors) ideas removed from novels and poems so that no one can possibly be offended by anything under the sun. Censorship is a cancer on society, and the world needs visionaries such as Ray Bradbury to forcefully draw attention to the cold hard facts that a majority of the population seems to ignore or fails to acknowledge. Once the true meaning has been chopped out of the books lining our shelves, it will be too late to reverse the momentum without the aid of some kind of miracle. Fahrenheit 451's message is one that all people should be exposed to, and this novel is such a quick (but powerful) read that everyone really should read it. As horrible as it is to envision, I fear that this type of censorship could indeed happen here.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "I am teaching \"Fahrenheit 451\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's \"1984,\" Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \"We,\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \"book burning,\" albeit in less literal forms, since \"Fahrenheit 451\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \"1984,\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television). The novel is based on a short story, \"The Fireman,\" that Bradbury published in \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" in 1951 and then expanded into \"Fahrenheit 451\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \"Pillar of Fire\" and the \"Usher II\" story from his 1950 work \"The Martian Chronicles.\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor. \"Fahrenheit 451\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \"there is always the danger of something being said.\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers. Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \"Fahrenheit 451\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Sometime in the not-so-distant future, the world will change severely. Soon people's homes will be completely fireproofed, leaving no use for firemen as they are thought of today. But they will not be out of work; their role will simply change. In an ever increasingly television oriented society where yesterday's classics are now thought of as censurable tripe, firemen will be starting fires, not stopping them. Their new role will be of a secret police that search out the hated books and raise their temperature to the level at which books burn, Fahrenheit 451. This is the premise of Ray Bradbury's novel. Bradbury's story is an ominous look into where he fears society is presently headed. It is in many ways a warning against existing increasing rates of demoralization, drug use, addiction to non thought-provoking activities, and illiteracy. He easily communicates how such simple trends could evolve into societal brainwashing and individuals who say they are happy, think they are 'social,' and simply spend all their time in their parlors (the ultimate in new television technology). One of the self-proclaimed 'odd' people of this book went decidedly against the norm in saying, \"But I don't think it's social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you?\" However, this book is not solidly a story of doom and gloom. The main character is a fireman named Montag and he ends up providing hope for the reader. While he is not a godlike hero, made up of courage and thew, he does fit the quixotic template in that he is a sad classicist in a new and frightening time. After only a small jolt of reality from an imaginative child, he realizes the world could be made of truth and beauty, rather than the contemporary cheap thrills and insatiable cupidity. Furthermore, this tale has much in common with two other critically acclaimed classics. Montag's government is merely interested in controlling the people while waging war with other super powers, much like the opression in George Orwell's 1984. Additionally, individuals hold very little sacred, no one cares for human life and everyone is looking for a cheap (often-dangerous) thrill. This is a public where men who handle drug overdoses are not concerned that such matters happen \"nine or ten a night,\" all of this general apathy is mirrored in the novel Brave New World. But, again, Bradbury is a creative author, and his visions of the future are not nearly as hopeless as 1984, or so alien and drug based as Brave New World. Fahrenheit 451's point is twofold. While it warns against where society is headed, it also shows that it only takes good people like Montag to bring society back from the brink of ruination. This faith in the goodness of the common man does not falter and shows optimism that is not always part of such works. Upbeat themes can be hard to find in such otherwise bleak forewarnings, and even in most normal classics it is hard to find a purely happy ending and/or main point. Seeing as this book was published over forty years ago one would assume that it is out of date, but this is not true. It is a science-fiction book without any unbelievable differences between this projected world and our own. Also, Fahrenheit 451 is easily read. The book communicates its point in a mere 160 pages, none of which are filled with incomprehensible vocabulary. It contains enough action for those who like it, and plenty of Montag's self-realizations for readers interested in seeing characters delve into their own mind's inner recesses. This book should be a joy to anyone who chooses to pick it up. Conversely, this easily enjoyed book carries with it some strong meaning. Montag's experiences are a warning to people who would get so used to their impersonal lifestyle that they would become desensitized to many of the world's horrors. Upon finishing the book, one is sure to be more guarded against choosing an easy path, and therefore becoming less of a human. Bradbury did well in bringing the way life became more and more impersonal and barbaric. \"I put up with (my children) when they come home three days a month; it's not bad at all. You heave them into the 'parlor' and turn on the switch. It's like washing clothes.\" In likening children to annoying creatures which deserve as much attention as laundry, the character who made this statement both disgusts the audience and says the statement as if it were only natural. The author has a talent for letting his audience see situations both as they normally would and as the characters do. Even through the opening we see some of the book's many themes played out in Montag.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "\"The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\" Thus says FAHRENHEIT 451's Professor Faber in explaining to Guy Montag the importance of the \"telling detail\" of books. Montag is ready to hear these words, his job as a book burner in this twisted society of Ray Bradbury's invention no longer makes sense to him. Books are illegal in the world of FAHRENHEIT 451. So is driving under 55 m.p.h. Faster is always considered better. Montag's society doesn't want anyone to stop and reflect, because it realizes that if people stop and think about things, they'll get restless. As Montag's fire captain tells him, \"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed.\" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself. Problems aren't faced; they are burned. This is the world Guy Montag rebels against; how deeply it reflects our own world is something to think about along the way. Ray Bradbury is a good writer, one who encourages people to ask the question \"why\". He wants everyone to have a voice and to be able to express himself or herself, but not in such a way that they drown out other voices--the best ideas, he seems to believe, will naturally come to the fore. A short book of under 180 pages, FAHRENHEIT 451 is often assigned to middle school students. For those--like myself--who missed it in school, it still stands as an important work for all lovers of reading, freedom, and ideas for their own sake.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "\"Fahrenheit 451\", written by Ray Bradbury, is the chilling, prophetic, science fiction novel of the future. About censorship, it portrays a world where books are outlawed by a totalitarian goverenment, it shows how society's only goal is to achieve \"pleasure\" through the senses. It tells of a world where petty facts are more valued than knowledge and ideas; a place and time where no one questions what they are doing and why, but just doing it by rote. Guy Montag is a fireman of the future. Ironically, his job is to start fires, to burn everything, especially \"corrupt\" books that contradict the government, and society's way of life; books that make people think and learn to question things. Like all others, he doesn't ask questions, and enjoys his job, enjoys burning things, because \"fire is bright and fire is clean.\" He lives oblivious to the frightening realities of life until his next-door neighbor, Clarisse, a young girl of seventeen, teaches him to ponder what might be behind the books that he burns, to learn to ask the question \"why?\" This causes him to undergo a \"crisis of fiath.\" Examining his life for the first time, he sees how empty and meaningless it is. His wife cares for nothing else than her \"television family\" and is sucked into a world of endless chatter, movement, and moving images. He realizes the terrible horror of what society is doing; watching the tube, \"oohing\" and \"aahing\" but not really talking nor communicating with one another. Montag grows to recognize what a corrupt society he is living in. When clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag is motivated to make some changes in his life. During nighttime \"calls,\" he starts hoarding books away in his home, determined to understand what is behind those pages. Montag also tries to ignore Captain Beatty who tries to confuse him in his search for the meaning of books. Pondering the questions of life, his futile search for the ultimate \"truth\" leads him to Faber, a retired English professor. With Faber's help, Montag finds the road to justice and restoring the \"past\" where people are not afraid. Written in third-person, this book is an excellent portrayal of human nature; the good, the bad, and the in-between. Ray Bradbury, the author, paints a vivid picture of a future with no books, and makes the reader realize that without books, creativity and thought would be stifled. Literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and rich symbolism (example: \"seashells\" are the future generation's discmans) are used by the author to enrich the story. There are many types of conflicts shown in \"Fahrenheit 451;\" person vs. self, person vs. society, and person vs. person. Montag struggles with himself and tries to distinguish between right and wrong. He also battles with the society around him, and tries to make them realize that books are not to be feared, but worshipped. This is evident when he reads the poem to Mildred and her friends while they are in the \"parlor\" watching the \"walls.\" But becuase of their lack of understanding and depth, they do not udnerstand the purpose and meaning behind the poem and regards Montag as being \"crazy.\" Montag'ss struggles with Captain Beatty is the person vs. person conflict represented in the book. Since the world declining to conditions recounted in the book is hgihly possible, the novel has an \"aura of chilling prophecy,\" which I like. A sense of the \"not so distant future,\" with fantastic magical realism such as \"spacecrafts\"are common in all of Ray Bradbury's work, such as the \"Illustrated Man\" and \"Fahrenheit 451.\" I enjoyed reading this \"thought-provoking novel,\" about the future and censorship. It is no small wonder why there are over four and a half million copies in print all over the world.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "When David Limbaugh let his friend Steve know that he had doubts about Christianity, he was surprised by Steve’s response. Instead of a blast of arrogant judgmentalism, Steve responded like a Christian should—with grace and evidence. What has happened since that time is told in this excellent new book. Limbaugh artfully tells his journey from skepticism about Christ to skepticism about skepticism and ultimately to trust in Christ. David is a lawyer, but he doesn’t write like a lawyer. While he’s intellectually precise, he writes as if he’s sitting across the table from you, anticipating your questions and objections. This is rare for a book of Christian evidences (often called Christian apologetics). Such books often read like technical manuals, but not Jesus on Trial. Limbaugh not only does a masterful job of highlighting the abundant evidence that supports Christianity, his insights into what the scriptures actually say will have you marveling at the tapestry of scripture and the Savior who wove it. From the very beginning, Limbaugh bares his soul, holding nothing back about how his previous doubts were shielded by an embarrassing lack of knowledge. He writes, “I knew, after all, that I hadn’t really given the Bible itself a hearing, much less a fair one. To my surprise— and this is embarrassing to admit—Steve showed me how verses of Scripture, both Old and New Testaments, were tied to others in content and theme with remarkable frequency. Amazingly, I had never looked at a reference Bible before, and I was blown away. My ignorance was on display, but Steve wasn’t remotely judgmental— to help me learn more, he even gave me that Bible. I was genuinely intrigued to discover that the Bible was not simply a mishmash of stories, allegories, alleged historical events, and moral lessons. There was obviously a pattern here, and for the first time in my life the Bible appeared to me to be thematically integrated. The scales on my eyes started peeling away.” His two chapters called “Aha Moments” reveal the numerous tipping points in Limbaugh’s journey where scale after scale fell away—tipping points that no honest seeker of truth can ignore. Of course, as Limbaugh admits, many who are not interested in truth, or have their own agenda, ignore or remake Christ in their own image. He writes, “We must not casually remake Jesus in the image in which we prefer to see Him or which conforms to the popular culture’s misperceptions about Him. Our politically correct culture may, presumptuously, choose to recast Jesus as indifferent to sin and saccharine sweet, no matter the circumstances, but this Jesus is God, and God cannot look upon sin. What do these revisionists make of the Jesus Who made a whip of cords and drove the moneychangers out of the Temple (John 2: 15)? … What do the revisionists say about the Jesus Whom Paul describes as “revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus ” (2 Thess. 1: 7– 8)? What of the difficult moral standard Jesus laid down in the Sermon on the Mount? Did He show indifference to sin there?” Limbaugh rightfully concludes: “This idea that Jesus is meek, mild, indifferent, and non-judgmental is the stuff of pure myth.” In addition to correcting the culture’s emasculated view of Christ, Limbaugh has two fantastic chapters tackling the paradoxes of Christianity. These include: God’s plan of salvation, including the relationship between grace and works; the acknowledgement that we are sinful yet commanded to be perfect; the Trinity, that God is one in essence yet three in persons; that Jesus has two natures, human and divine; that you must give up your life to find it; that Christians are strong when they are weak; that God is sovereign yet humans have free will; that God knows all and is unchangeable, yet we are to pray; that the Bible is inspired yet written by men; and many others. The insights Limbaugh brings to these paradoxes are some of his own, and the best nuggets mined from Christian scholarship that I doubt you’ll find in one place anywhere else. Limbaugh devotes several chapters to the evidence for the Bible, including its unity and reliability as evidenced through history, archaeology, prophecy and science. He debunks several myths and misunderstandings along the way, and then saves his final chapter for what many think is the atheist’s trump card against God: Evil. Many years ago David provided me an “Aha Moment” during one of our very many theological discussions. He said, “Evil really bothers me, but only Christianity has a sensible answer to it.” There’s no question he’s correct. We wouldn’t even know what evil was unless good existed, and real objective good could only exist if God exists. As David explains, evil turns out to be a backhanded argument for God. In fact, evil is the very reason God entered human history in the person of Christ. Only his sacrifice can solve the evil in my heart and yours. David puts it this way: “Don’t be offended by the notion that you must have saving faith in Christ. Don’t assume that God is making you jump through unnecessary hoops. He is the One Who suffered for you. He did this so that you could live. He doesn’t ask you to believe because He is on a divine ego trip, but because He loves you and wants you to latch on to Him in order to be saved from your sins.” I just can’t recommend Jesus on Trial highly enough. Every thinking person should investigate the claims of Christ, who is unarguably the most influential human being to ever walk the earth. If his claims are true (and Limbaugh shows they are), then we won’t be putting him on trial—he will be putting each of us on trial. Only Christ can secure you a favorable verdict.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "\"Jesus on trial\" is very hard to put down. david limbaugh was a skeptic and a lawyer and researched all of the historical evidence of the gospels and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and used his legal experience to affirm all of this together and showed how he was able to become a christian and presents the proof that shows that christ is who he said he was and what he said he set out to do. recamended all david limbaugh books, by faith Iam still standing by al higginbotham, all josh mcdowell books, all billy graham books,all anne graham lotz books, all franklin graham books, 41 portrait of my father by george w bush, all father jonathan morris books", "id": "12290"}
{"review": "Let me start by saying that this man is nothing like some of his other famous family members, which at one time were chunky and obnoxious and now are manicured, face-lifted, teeth-whitened but still too much of a \"know-it-all\" attitude for my taste. In short, I dislike any person (irrespective of their POV) who uses name-calling, wordsmithery, and hand-waving to ward off opponents and make their point or defend their position. I do, however, love the Lord, and any Christian who can fend off the rising tide of neo-atheism that is attacking his church at least deserves a chance to be heard. . This book is something completely different. I was pleasantly surprised by the measured, thoughtful, respectful tone of this tome. This book is compelling, well-researched, and engagingly written. It tells the story of his traditional mid-Western upbringing (complete with Sunday school), his drifting away from the faith when he went to college, and then his rediscovering of Christianity as an adult who \"knew something was missing.\" . At the beginning of the book he shares the tough questions he asked when adrift from Christianity including: Does a mythical god even have a plan for our redemption? How does this god exact justice? How does he draw his creatures closer to him--assuming he cares in the slightest about them? Where is he anyway? I'm not sure he completely answers all of this by the end of the book, but at least the reader knows that he isn't operating on \"blind faith,\" but has asked himself some tough questions about his God and his faith. He further admits that \"without even investigating the Bible as a young adult, I had serious doubts about Christianity.\" I have found this true in my own life and other's too: Virtually everyone I know who is an atheist or anti-theist does not know anything about the Bible's overarching theme--they've just been turned off by religion in general, the \"stifling\" Do's and Don'ts, or the modern misconception that it is a book full of \"stories\" (with some even questioning the historicity of Christ, which almost no scholar--even atheist ones--would do.) . Limbaugh shares with us that the genesis of his faith's rekindling started (appropriately) around Christmas one year when he was visiting an old college friend. Limbaugh shared that he \"just doesn't believe in Christianity anymore.\" His believing friend asked him why and a deep conversation ensued. He friend--much more well-versed in the Bible than he--began to show him prophetic scriptures from the Old Testament that pointed to Christ. Limbaugh shares that he was \"blown away\" and began to realize that \"the Bible was not simply a mishmash of stories, allegories, alleged historical events, and moral lessons. . . For the first time in my life, I began to realize that the Bible had a theme.\" . I won't spoil the read by saying any more except that Limbaugh has quilted together scriptural quotes, historical references, personal insights, and meaningful examples to create a compelling book. He brings a lawyer's keen mind to many of these spiritual age old questions and, in the opinion of this \"juror,\" gives an excellent defense.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "It's interesting to note that so many so-called \"objective\" viewpoints are from Biblical 'scholars' who have made a life of trying to prove the historical existence of Jesus, when in reality, all they have are references from other religious institutions whose agenda is identical to their own. The truth is, our King James Bible is a re-write of the Catholic Bible, of which there have been over 600 revisions in the last 400 years. Their so-called 'evidence' does not stem from any real historical evidence which would include references from outside of the Bible, such as recorded writings from the local Roman government which would have charged Jesus with the intended insurrection of which his fellow Jews accused him. Also, there is no documentation of any tax records, of which all working citizens would have been required to pay, including a working carpenter such as Jesus. As famous as he was, there surely would have been some documentation of his miracles and wonders from some non-religious source. Correct historical verification requires that the same record come from several different sources, and not from several scrolls found in the same cave, and whose texts were written as much as seventy years after the supposed events took place. No one that is a religious practising Christian seems to notice that every single reference they use as 'proof' of the existence of Jesus not only never stems from outside of the Bible itself, but that their other so-called evidence is from 'documentation' that stems from only religious institutions- specifically Christian religious institutions. But you can't dissuade these individuals and their institutions of the most likely reality, which is that a fledgeling Christian church who borrowed heavily from the mythos of previous Greek, Roman, and Egyptian gods and goddesses did what it could to survive, invented the first version of 'Superman', and gave any convert a special magic pass to get into Heaven after death. What was not to love about a religion this easy to follow? There was so much furor over the Shroud of Turin back in the seventies, but carbon-dating proved that the fabric was not older than seven hundred years. They supposedly found the tomb of Jesus' family, but a group of skeletons with no identifying marks like a family 'crest' of some sort, or an Aramaic inscription, it would only be pure conjecture, but we know that the sycophants will take it as 'gospel truth' without having done the slightest bit of real homework other than reading their scriptures, and books that religious scholars have written over the centuries. If we were to take everything they said as fact, then books that were written based on so-called scientific evidence would have 'proven' in the nineteenth century that the black man was inferior both physically and mentally to the white man. The plain truth of the matter is that these books were written by racists, and the Christian religion is based in large part on prejudiced thinking that has become so institutionalized that almost no one in America questions its validity. Is there a God? Almost certainly, every civilization on Earth has a mythos about some sort of Divine Source, and the scientific method of historic verification is more closely followed in this vein due to its universal nature. But if Jesus even existed at all, was he God, or divine in nature? That is another question altogether, and this book can ONLY be the writer's unfounded OPINION of what he thinks is true, simply because it makes sense to him in his religious quest for inner peace. It cannot claim to be the ultimate TRUTH, and if you want that, you will not find it in this book.", "id": "12290"}

{"review": "Having also been very familiar with the subjects of this book, I may be somewhat biased, but still highly recommend this book to just about anyone. It is a beautifully written book about one very determined, talented Police Officer and his one of kind dog, the also determined, regal, sensitive, and amazingly talented, JJ. Adam Russ has captured the personalities perfectly. The descriptions of the tracks and captures of \"bad guys\" and locating the missing are spot on. I was there for some of the successes, and some of the failures, (it's a true story after all) and they were truly something to watch. JJ hot on a track, nose to ground, baying to the City he was coming was a remarkable sight. Russ also begins each chapter with a description of the features of the Bloodhound along with some history with origins of the Bloodhound and describing why they are so beneficial in police work which adds to making this a special read. I was so happy to see this story written. This was one dog that deserved his own book. This is a great tribute to a very special creature, five years gone now, but will always be remembered by many. And a great accolade to a very tenacious Police Officer, whose strength in character and support of a loving family and friends made it all possible.", "id": "48"}
{"review": "Once I picked up this book, I could not finish it until the end. The book has a well blended mixture of stories about \"JJ\" a Bloodhound who was owned and handled by Officer Mike Serio. It tells the story of how Mike and JJ beat the odds, by not only becoming the best tracking team in an urban environment, but the challenges he faced getting there. There are several 'stories' out there about bloodhounds doing phenomenal things, but most are just that, stories. The pitfalls and successes documented in this book are backed by real life finds and criminal arrests (over 300 of them!). Having had the pleasure of knowing JJ and following his tail, reading the book was quite emotional, to say the least. I will probably read it many times over my lifetime. Mike and JJ (RIP) are a true inspiration to us all, regardless of what obstacles we may face in life.", "id": "48"}
{"review": "Responding to the question, \"Do you want to go to work?\" - and the command ,\"Go find!\", JJ goes into action sniffing, tracing, tracking, following the scent of suspects, finds them, corners them, bays incessantly, slobbering on them, holding them until his human handler and friend, police officer Serio and the police team arrive to take the suspect into custody. JJ is a loveable hounddog, raised,groomed, taught and trained by Officer Serio. This book is an engrossing, riveting,alternately tense and laughable account of JJ's journey from puppy to acceptance into the K9 squad of the Salt Lake City police force. Yes, K9 squad. Like any neophyte entering the workplace, JJ had to prove that he had the necessary skill, determination and fortitude to do the job. His performance with Officer Serio brings about the creation of a Bloodhound program and today's current use of Bloodhounds and German Shepards working together as one formidable K9 squad. A hard fought battle and win for Officer Serio, a triumph for JJ and a suspects worst nightmare. As one suspect so aptly put it, on page 218, \"I would have gotten away except for that d---- dog!\" Photos are included of JJ with his human family, Officer Serio, his wife Lisa and their baby, Mikaela - and of JJ's visit to Shriners Hospital for children where he comforted and charmed children propelling them into uncontrollable giggles. Regrettably JJ was taken off the Elizabeth Smart missing person abduction initial trail search. JJ was hot on her trail, following her scent. She heard him baying from a distance, coming up that arduous dangerous, unforgiving mountain terrain, behind her and her abductors. But JJ was called back, not permitted to continue. Officer Serio was told to abandon their mountain search and follow other leads investigators had for them back at the command post at the Smart's house. Her abductors might have been captured sooner, and she might have been returned to her family safely without much of the horror she was forced to endure. Well I have shared enough. Time for you to read the book. Kudos to author Adam David Russ. The book is well written, easy to read. I received a complimentary copy from the publisher. Glad I did. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and am in awe of Officer Serio, Hounddog JJ's outstanding work, the police force and the K9 squad/unit.", "id": "48"}
{"review": "Adam Russ has written more than a warm and fuzzy dog story. His Bloodhound in Blue is a testament to the initiative, courage, and tenacity of police officer Mike Serio and his canine partner, JJ, in overcoming bureaucratic resistance to enlisting the skills of a well-trained tracker. You'll enjoy the author's wry sense of humor as he relates the misadventures of Salt Lake City's more intellectually challenged criminals and their efforts to evade capture by a goofy, good-natured klutz who needs help getting over fences. Even more, you'll be touched by the confidence and trust both man and dog develop for each other as they become an unbeatable team. Bloodhound in Blue has all the elements of any good story: adventure, suspense, danger, laughter, and tears. I enjoyed it thoroughly.", "id": "48"}

{"review": "First, let me say, I knew JJ personally, having worked with Mike Serio after he became an officer. I watched first hand his dedication, his devotion, and his great passion for his work and bringing bloodhounds into our department as well as Utah. There are very few selfless officers as was witnessed time and again by Mike and JJ's actions, frequently putting in over 12 hours a day or coming in on days off to be of service. JJ was an inspiration to all of us, just hearing his baying energized officers, dispatchers, and other personnel. And his service, even in the face of health issues, was far beyond anyone's comprehension. This book is inspiring to anyone, especially animal lovers, but it is a treasure to those of us who know the Serio family and loved JJ. Thank you, Mike and Lisa, for sharing your life with all of us.

{"review": "This is a book I looked forward to reading, but then wasn't sure I could knowing the outcome. You can't talk about Mike without thinking of JJ, and that's hard for me. JJ is not \"just a dog\", he's was a loveable, awesome, slobber bucket. You knew if JJ was called out to assist, he was going to do all he could to make Mike proud of him. Nothing was sweeter than hearing JJ \"bay\" over the police radio. You knew right then that the outcome was going to end up \"JJ 1 - bad guy 0\" Working with Mike & JJ, I knew a little bit of their rough start in the department. After reading the first few chapters and everything Mike & JJ went through to be \"official\", I cried a little, then I got so mad & disappointed. How could someone NOT see the great potential this team had? Losing these two would of been a big mistake! (In your face \"C\")! I could not put this book down. I found the only time I did was to wipe the tears. This book made me laugh a little & cry a lot. My heart breaks for Mike & his family. (LE family as well). JJ was so loved & I truly believe he knew that. Thank you Adam for bringing this great story to print. Now JJ can be loved by those who read your book & fall in love with him & his great ability to \"go to work\". JJ couldn't of had a better trainer or partner, nor could Mike.

{"review": "I knew little about police dogs and even less about Bloodhounds and now having read Bloodhound in Blue I'm fascinated with both. The author did a nice job of both entertaining and educating the reader, all the while endearing the star of the book, Officer JJ (and his co-star, Officer Mike Serio). The stories of chasing the bad guys were my favorite parts of the book. Mixed with excitement and humor, I found myself lost in imagining each escapade of the floppy eared, slobbery Officer JJ finding his man, and earning the admiration of the community and even the other canine handlers who at first were skeptical of Bloodhounds performing police work. I also appreciated that when the inevitable happened, JJ passed on to Doggie Heaven, the author didn't belabor the sad event but just gave it a proper place in the story. All in all, a fun and easy read - grab your own copy, you won't be disappointed.", "id": "48"}
{"review": "I'm a fan of Clifford Irving's work, so bear that in mind. This is not his best book but it's good enough to be better than almost anything on the best-seller list today. It's an imaginative and action-filled story of a \"fountain of youth\" in modern Colorado near the mountain resort of Aspen. The characters are solid and real. The atmosphere, including a great scene of an avalanche, is excellent. I found its philosophical underpinnings worthy of consideration. The writing is crisp and elegant, and I finished it in three sessions. You can't go wrong with this Irving.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "Some people view this as Clifford Irving's least successful novel. That said, he is such a fine writer that \"The Spring\" is still considerably superior to most other contemporary novels and/or thrillers. It's a remarkable story about a community in Colorado that has discovered -- and successfully hides, until the story starts -- the Fountain of Youth. Springville is in the vicity of Aspen, but don't hunt for it; it's a fantasy by this wonderfully imaginative author. I won't spoil the tale by telling you more. It's atmospheric, tense, and, usual, Irving paints compelling and sympathetic characters. And, as usual, he writes crisp and yet evocative prose. The snow scenes, particularly the avalanche, are remarkable. Sol Stein, in \"Stein on Writing,\" holds this author up as a master of point of view -- and he's right.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "A master novelist who has crafted believable, chilling tales of Nazi death camps and the Mexican revolution could never go wrong writing about his own neighborhood. Clifford Irving demonstrates brilliance engaging the reader in the physical and social landscapes of Pitkin County, CO, encompassing Aspen and a higher altitude enclave, Spring Hill. The authenticity he visits on scene setting, capturing the beauty and cache of Aspen as well as the high-altitude hamlet with a deadly secret, gives one the sense of being braced by Rocky Mountain air. By the thrilling conclusion, I felt as if I could cross-country ski the treacherous maroon bells! And when the remote villagers spoke their secret language, which is based upon an American argot called Boontling, the realism kicked up another notch. Mr. Irving renders his principal characters with fine, life-like detail. Dennis, the big city lawyer turned part-time counselor/ part-time ski bum, is deftly portrayed as a caring father and slightly oversexed new husband. His wife Sofie, ski champ and Mayor of Spring Hill, is both sexy and smart. Even the bit players are roundly drawn. A drunken artist who is supported by the citizenry ends up in peril when he is considered at risk of divulging the town’s big secret. As the plot thickens and both Dennis and Sofie have critical choices to make regarding which of their alliances will endure. The story becomes more engrossing as the stakes are raised with each succeeding scene. The shocking conclusion is just one of so many switchbacks, like the ones on Hwy. 82, following the Roaring Fork River up to Aspen. Clifford Irving is a master of his art who has lavished his talents on a subject encompassing his home turf. In his novel The Spring, the rewards of Mr. Irving's Rocky Mountain highs … and lows have accrued to his readership.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "Slow beginning, but suspense starts to build with the trial scenes. Then it speeds right along, building to a satisfactory climax. Thought the author wrapped up with a rather pat ending. While the description of the mountain scenes put the reader right there, I had trouble with character development. It was the premise of the Spring that I found intriguing. Yes, I would recommend it for a good read overall.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "I'm a fan of sci-fi/fantasy and this book comes as close to the genre as any of Irving's work. It's about a very private society who enjoys the magical properties of a natural spring giving them ultra-long life. But as with any such advantage over your fellow man, it comes with a price. The ultimate price in the end. A good read. I'm definitely a fan!", "id": "18"}
{"review": "The basic idea for the plot is not bad, but the execution was terrible. This book should have been a short story at best, no more than fifty pages. It was not a long book, but it still felt like a really long walk where your feet are tired and just want it to be over (yes, I have trouble giving up books which I've already read half way through). Irving is a talented writer, and this will not be the last book I read by him, but it seemed that he was not inspired to write this at all. This is the kind of writing which feels forced, like having to finish a high school English paper. The dialogue is unnatural, the pace is very slow, the ending is not surprising...it basically fails in every category. The reason I give it three stars instead of two is because I did enjoy being transported to the Colorado Rockies where it takes place. I would only recommend this book to people who feel compelled to read every book by Irving, or people that live in the Aspen area. I will conclude by saying that this does not cloud my view of Irving as a great author, but I do believe most people would find this book to be disappointing, so I would recommend Trial or The Hoax, also by the author.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "This book should be rated under the genre of fantasy as the main plot is somewhat unbelievable. It's really misleading to rate this as a legal thriller since only a small part is spent in the courtroom defending two of the characters. There are parts of the book that are unnecessary to the development of the plot such as the \"mystery language\". There are also parts that are \"left up in the air\" without explanation or seem unrealistic. Without giving anything away, what is \"allowed\" in the ending is quite unbelieveable - it doesn't match up with what has been disallowed in the rest of the book.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "Few readers realize that Dennis Conway, the protagonist of Clifford Irving’s THE SPRING, has the same surname as the protagonist of the novel and movie SHANGRI-LA.

{"review": "Since others have prominently noted that this book is very similar to one of Kessler's earlier works, I will say this is my first exposure. Content: Although I lean conservative, I am neither a Democrat nor a Republican. I was eager to read this book because it interests me how the 'anointed' really live their lives. Opposite my expectation, I did not get the impression that this book's sole purpose was to bash one political party or the other. For example, the Obamas are generally portrayed in a favorable light, but not all good. The same is true of the Bush family. I do believe the author reported accurately what the Secret Service agents revealed to him. It seems that the book has two purposes. First, to expose the true character of our elected officials. And second, to expose how the Secret Service management makes bad decisions which ultimately puts protectee lives in danger. Not that it was wrong, or bad, but one thing that did not grab my interest were the parts that delved into the inner workings of the Secret Service. Style: This is mostly an easy read. However, in a couple of places in the book the author follows a couple of rabbit trails and then abruptly snaps back to the original subject. I found that to be hard to follow and a bit frustrating, which is why I took one of the stars away. Overall, I enjoyed the book, and learned a few things. What more could you ask for?

{"review": "I had previously read Kessler's first book on the secret service and enjoyed it, so bought this one also. Unfortunately, it is essentially the same book, very little new information. I feel like I spent $18 needlessly, and shame on Mr. Kessler for publishing a second book almost exactly like the first one. I won't be buying any more books by this author.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "This is a good book, however it is 95% a carbon copy of Kessler's book \"In the President's Secret Service.\" If you have read that already, you are only gaining stories about Joe Biden swimming nude in front of female agents and how he wastes millions of dollars flying back and forth from Washington to Delaware multiple times a day.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "Fantastic book. First I've read by the author but I found the writing style engaging and the coverage of the personal and professional lives as seen by the agents of Presidents and their families to be even handed and fair. The description of the politicization of the agency and the downward spiral of standards and ethics is shocking but not too surprising as it's simply another symptom of the disease.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "I could not wait to get this book into my hands and for the first half of the book my interest was held and I gained some insight I didn't previously have. As I progressed onto the second half of the book however; I began to lose interest as the author got busy repeating himself. So, in a nutshell, although there were some interesting stories and tidbits of information I found this book to be grossly overpriced and twice as long as it should have been. I will add however, that it really did upset me to find out the cost of V.P. Biden's misuse of both the helicopter and AirForce One when we can't get food in the mouths of many of the kids in this country!", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "This book is so, so good. Not only does it offer the sordid and egregious details of some of our recent presidents, but it shows the tender moments, too. Author Ronald Kessler knows his stuff! In this, THE FIRST FAMILY DETAIL, he blends all his research and interviews together to make an interesting, page-turning book. I could NOT put it down! What kept me pulled into this book was Kessler’s gradual introduction into another world. Chapter-by-chapter he would present new terms (such as “the beast”, “the jackal”, and all the presidents’ code names: Timberwolf, Eagle, Searchlight, Passkey, Renegade, etc.) and he would describe security protocol (how many people are required to travel internationally, the fade-away tape used in processions, the actual protocol for “the football”, etc.). All the outrageous moments from the back of the book are here: actor Bradley Cooper getting a “free pass” through security, Biden’s $12,406 gulf trips, and Clinton’s current mistress (code named Energizer). There are plenty of other outrageous moments: which presidents slept around, which ones peed in the open in front of press and staff, which ones shunned security. I appreciated seeing the kind moments, too. Like Barbara Bush ensuring a 40-year-old agent had a hat while on the cold beach. Or, the Obamas serving agents chili during the Super Bowl. It all comes together to paint an interesting, inside-scoop picture of the presidency and their protection. Kessler doesn’t appear politically aimed in any of this writing. We see both sides of Republicans and Democrats alike. Sure, there may be some noticeable patterns, but both parties have their heroes and their heretics. No matter how you cut it, this book is a highly entertaining and interesting read. Thank you to Crown Forum for sending me this book through Blogging for Books for review.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "This book is a quick read, but it's not particularly well written. It tries to be two things at once: first, a tabloid-like recounting of anecdotes ranging from protectees' nastiness to their free-ranging sexual exploits; second, an expose of mismanagement of the Secret Service, which rips off taxpayers and endangers the lives of elected officials. I suspect the author would have preferred the latter.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "OCTOBER SNOW is about friendship and loyalty and witty repartee. It's about sensitivities to subtle clues when friends have secrets, and it provides thought-provoking explanations of behaviour far removed from the original bad stuff that can happen in relationships. It's a tightly written narrative about the after-effects of marital abuse - and the current effects, too - and it illustrates how bad stuff affects people through succeeding generations. But mostly it's a story of the journey of three friends and the waves of influence every person makes when things happen, both good and bad. The story kept me on the edge of my seat and contributed to a bout of insomnia - I couldn't get those characters out of my mind in the middle of the night!", "id": "18"}
{"review": "When Samantha becomes a victim of relationship abuse, she needs her friends Josie and Maxine more than ever. Josie has worked as a Domestic Violence counselor and knows the Family Court System. As the women plan Samantha's escape, they find that while they are friends, they don't really know each other. And once they learn to trust again, they share their pasts with each other. And the women discover that they have more in common than they knew. I highly recommend October Snow, as it is paced well and polished. While the characters are fiction, abuse is real and happens every day. It has been a week since I finished the book, and I'm still thinking about it. The characters and the story resonate with truth and the twist at the end fits with real life.", "id": "18"}
{"review": "I cried, I laughed, I simply couldn't put it down. I cancelled what was on the schedule for yesterday afternoon to finish it. This is quite simply, a book I wish I'd written. Ms. Brooks takes a difficult contemporary subject matter and weaves a story so engrossing that one never has the feeling they're learning about a social issue. That is no small feat. The characters are beautifully drawn and very believable. They're real people. The author's ear for speech and eye for setting are spot on. The story of the friendship of the three women, Jo, Maxine, and Samantha is at the core of the book, but what happens to these women is what keep you turning page after page. When it's over, you wish there were 100 more pages. It's that good. Recommend it, you better believe it! You are in for one of the best reads you'll ever have. Kudos Ms. Brooks.

{"review": "\"Really great books are hard to find, harder to put down, and impossible to forget,\" - source unknown. This quote made me think of October Snow, instantly. It is a book that will stick with me forever. The emotions, thoughts, and personal reflection that this book stirred in me are practically impossible to articulate, but I'm going to give it a try. October Snow is an in-your-face look at the reality that so many women face each and every day. Centered around the topic of domestic violence, the book is an amazing way for victims to find a character they can fully identify with. It is this common thread of domestic violence that ties the three friends in this book together, but interestingly enough, they don't even realize it until somewhere towards a quarter of the way into the book. But there is so much more to this book than that. Most notable is the fact that there is useful information for victims and their families - information that could make the difference between successfully making it out and ending up being back in the clutches of an abuser. But what really snagged me and kept pulling me in was the emotional investment I had in each of the characters. I was able to identify with all of them in one way or another. I also found myself wonderfully bonded to them and their little circle, if for no other reason than they remind me so very much of the bonds that I have formed with other women in my own life. Their mannerisms, their reactions, their emotional scars, their attachment, all of what you see from these three women describe the reality of how domestic violence and trauma affect a person forever. That, above all else, makes October Snow nothing short of an addictive read. And as I continued to turn the pages late into the night, I found myself gripped with fear, sadness, happiness, and concern. I'm not a person that cries over books or movies, at least not easily. But I cried for at least three chapters while reading October Snow because of how deeply and profoundly the book touched some of the deepest parts of my soul and humanity. I wanted, so desperately, to give October Snow a full five stars. The story definitely deserves it, but there were a couple of minor issues that kept me from doing so. The first was the fact that there were a few instances where I had a hard time following the story. This was particularly true for some of the dialogues; I couldn't tell who was speaking sometimes and it threw me. But there were also a few scenes that I felt jumped too quickly for me. There were also a few scenes where I felt like the topic or conversation dragged; I just wanted to get back to the story. But please don't let any of this deter you from reading October Snow because, in all honesty, it wasn't so distracting or jarring that it took much from the overall story. I still enjoyed the experience of reading it more than I've enjoyed reading any book in a very long time. And I'd give it a solid 4.5 stars if there was a half-star option. =) Jenna Brooks is definitely an author to watch for; I have a feeling she's going to end up taking the literary world by storm! And, for the record, if there's ever a book that needs to be made into a movie, this is it! Many thanks to the author for giving me a reading experience that will forever be a part of my life.", "id": "18"}

The characters are so believable that you will become emotionally invested in their experience. I recommend having tissues at hand and enough time to finish the book in one sitting because you will not want to put it down. Take the time to read this book and then tell your friends to read it.

{"review": "Written by Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the US, the 'Federalist Papers' are a series of articles written for a New York newspaper. Mr Hamilton goes into detail on the thought process behind the US Constitution and clearly shows the intent behind the Constitution and the BIll of Rights. In this respect, the 'Papers' clearly and concisely outline what the Founding Fathers meant and should be used by citizens, political leaders, and the court system to accurately adjudicate the true meaning behind our Constitution. I found this collection of writings by Mr Hamilton to be a very humbling eye opener as it can clearly be seen how far off track the US is getting with \"modern\" interpretation of the Constitution. By reading these papers, you can clearly see that the Founding Fathers were well educated in both literature and history and attempted to produce a framework of laws governing the US that would preculde pitfalls that earlier Republics have fallen into. Yes, the US is a Constitutional Republic and the Founding Fathers never intended nor wanted the US to be a Democracy. We are a Rule of Law nation not a majority rule one and the 'Federalist Papers' makes that more than abundantly clear. For example, in Federalist #26, Mr Hamilton clearly explains the Second Amendment, clarifying that the 'militia' is all able-bodied men, and that the right to bear arms meant that citizens should have the same type of arms as the standing army because the full intent of the Second Amendment is to prevent government tyranny, not to protect hunting rights. I believe that the 'Federalist Papers' should be required reading by all High-School and college students in preparation for them to become well-informed voting citizens and able to preserve and protect the Republic our Founding Fathers have created.", "id": "3377866011"}

{"review": "I was able to read most of an advance copy of this book before Bill Drayton (founder of Ashoka: Innovators for the Public) snatched it away and ran off with it on his annual 2-week hiking trip to the mountains. I think this has to be the most important book - not just for women's rights globally but for human rights - published in my memory. Kristof and WuDunn weave together a most compelling story of how culture and customs historically suppress women. They tackle many tough, taboo topics - for example honor killing. But more importantly, they champion the stories of heroic women worldwide wholly committed to changing the many evils of the status quo. What is more, they posit a kind of general framework theory that the really important advances in human rights that are going to be made in the near future are going to be brought about by these entrepreneurial pioneering women. In essence, that the backbone of the human rights movement and of real change across all societies is going to be a direct function of brave women who give themselves permission to say \"NO\" to thousands of years of (to most Westerners) unimaginable oppressive cultural customs and who take it upon themselves to lead to a new way. Once you have read the book, it is very hard, if not impossible, to disagree with Kristof and WuDunn's general theme. To wit, the brave women of Iran who took to the streets to protest the results of the recent election. Among many other \"super\" women, HALF THE SKY spotlights the following inspirational Ashoka Fellows: · Sunitha Krishnan (India), founder of Prajwala, a citizen sector organization in Hyderabad, India, fighting forced prostitution and sex trafficking, rescuing women and children from sexual exploitation, incestual rape, sexual torture, and abuse in prostitution. Her organization helps former prostitutes learn vocational skills so they can move into new careers. \"Prajwala\" means \"an eternal flame\". · Sakena Yacoobi (Afghanistan), founder of the Afghan Institute of Learning, a citizen sector organization providing teacher training to Afghan women, educating and fostering education for girls and boys, and providing health education to women and children. Her organization also runs fixed and mobile health clinics that provide family planning services. Sakena holds the distinction of having been Ashoka's first Afghan Fellow. Educating women and girls was banned under the Taliban and is controversial under Islamic law. · Roshaneh Zafar (Pakistan), founder of Pakistani microfinance lender, Kashf. A former World Bank employee, she was inspired after a chance meeting with Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank. \"Kashf\" means \"miracle\" and Kashf is indeed fostering a miracle by leveraging microfinance to women to transform the role of women in Pakistani society and bringing about a poverty-free world. To date, Kashf supports 305,038 families in Pakistan, has disbursed $202 million, and has 52 branches nationwide. I am not alone in my enthusiasm for this book! Last Tuesday, September 15, 2009 from 1:15 pm to 2:45 pm, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (\"UNODC\") will be hosting a panel discussion and booksigning with Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn in the UN Trusteeship Council Chamber at UN Headquarters. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will deliver opening remarks. Every seat (550) in the Trusteeship Council Chamber was filled. The buzz out there is that many people are coming and that everyone is very excited about the publication and significance of this extraordinary milestone work. Five out of five stars. An absolute must read for anyone who cares about women's rights or human rights. A genuine eye popper that moves so fast, tackles so much that has hitherto been taboo and unmovable, and interweaves the unbelievably positive stories of the very heroic women already leading and creating change in a tapestry that is glimpse of a brave and very different, humanitarian new world. Once you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down. And once you have read it, you will be moved to help bring about tomorrow. Absolute proof that the glass (or the sky) is half full.

{"review": "As a feminist, I really looked forward to reading this book. I was lucky enough to find it at a book swap and didn't have to pay for it myself. Boy, am I glad I didn't. I give it three stars for what is trying to be accomplished: raising awareness about the plight of women around the world. Despite the heroic effort to bring this worldwide tragedy to light, Kristof and WuDunn have done a serious disservice to journalism, especially of the investigative nature. While their attempts to draw attention to the oppression of women through statistics as well as grueling and gruesome stories deserve an applause, they consistently pushed ideas without revealing the whole truth. This is lying through omission. In the section on prostitution, Kristof and WuDunn routinely would dismiss Western prostitution as \"voluntary\" and would flippantly dismiss the idea that women of America and other Western cultures can be enslaved. Page 24 of this book really revealed how disgustingly inattentive Kristof and WuDunn have been to sexual slavery in the West. \"Moreover, Western men usually go with girls who are more or less voluntary prostitutes...\" Combine this with page 9, \"We certainly don't think of prostitutes as slaves, forced to do what they do, for most prostitutes in America, China, and Japan aren't truly enslaved.\" Are they out of their minds? Either they have turned a blind eye to the nature of prostitution as a whole or they are purposefully leaving it out in order to make the culture of prostitution of more developing countries appear more bleak. Let us not forget the average of prostitutes in America is roughly 15-years-old. That doesn't sound very voluntary to me. I highly suggest they take a look at some of Rachel Lloyd's work and maybe they'll stop spewing such ignorance. When exploring the devastation AIDS has wrecked on our planet, Kristof and WuDunn do an excellent job of illustrating how terrible the sickness has been, especially in the developing world. Unfortunately, one of their \"fixes\" to the problem is that \"governments should encourage male circumcision, which reduces HIV risk significantly.\" No, it doesn't. Those studies are outdated and considered inconclusive, just as the same studies which link female circumcision to reduced HIV contraction. It's amazing how quickly they cry out against female genital mutilation of children and then call for the same to be done to little baby boys. If they mean adult-only circumcision, I would be more likely to agree since, at that point, it is the choice of the person who actually owns those genitals. But otherwise, this passage reeks of hypocrisy. Lastly, in their defense of Islam not being misogynistic, they lay large amounts of praise onto Aisha, Muhammad's \"favorite\" wife. Was it deliberate that they completely neglected to mention that she was married at six and raped at nine? Yes, raped. Because a nine-year-old does not and cannot consent to sexual intercourse. No, they left this out because it would have hurt the point they were making about how female-friendly the origins of Islam were. The purpose of the book, to educate and move to action, is worthy of praise. However, the direct distaste for the truth is abhorrent and it's disappointed that anything that may have undermined the authors' ideas was completely omitted. They have shamed the practice of journalism.", "id": "3377866011"}

{"review": "I believe in book's main premise: by empowering women and girls, we can change the world and help end poverty. However, I found it disappointing and shocking to read this entire book and not find a single story about water and sanitation. You can't even find the word \"water\" in the index. No doubt, the stories Nick and Sheryl tell are horrific and inspiring, and women living in poverty face obstacles that I can't even imagine. But, as I read it, I felt it was more of a collection of anecdotes from Nick and Sheryl's international travels rather than as advertised: a \"must-read\" and \"call to arms\" about how we can end global poverty. Having spent 19 years working in international aid, I don't see how you can seriously talk about helping women in poverty and not mention water or sanitation. For millions of girls from poor households, there is a straight tradeoff between time spent in school and time spent collecting water. For their mothers, time spent collecting water means they have little time for more productive work or rest. Being without access to water means that to obtain the water they need to survive, people resort to ditches, rivers and lakes polluted with human or animal excrement, and they carry that water home on their heads or backs, causing chronic back pains and sores, wearing flip flops if they are wearing shoes at all, walking uphill on steep, rocky or muddy paths. This daily walk for water saps their energy, diminishes their health status, and prevents them from participating in economic and social activities that are vital to the development of communities. Each day, * Women spend the equivalent of 340 million work days on water collection * Poor families spend $137 million is spent on treatment of water-related diseases * 5 million girls are collecting water instead of attending school * 7,000 children worldwide die from the lack of safe water and a toilet Poverty and water are inextricably linked. What began as a hopeful read has unfortunately left me jaded and wondering if providing PVC piping and septic tanks just don't have the emotional appeal and book-selling potential of sex slavery and genital mutilation. So I'm in! Let's invest in women. I believe it will pay off. But we have to be smart about it. I've met too many girls who dropped out of school at the age of 6 to help their mothers carry water, so it makes no sense to me to invest in education in a community with no toilets or accessible, safe water supplies. It makes no sense to me to build a health clinic of any kind in a community without toilets or water either, because 80% of the illnesses that will come into that clinic will be caused by the lack of water and toilets. I'm also a believer in micro-lending, but I've met a lot of people who have defaulted on their loans in order to pay medical bills for a family member suffering from diarrhea. I'm excited that people are talking about women and development. But I'm disappointed at this missed opportunity to talk about the vital links between water and sanitation and poverty and empowerment. We need to act appropriately to ensure that the lack of attention to water and sanitation does not undermine all other development goals.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "Albeit I am attuned to current events, I have not known the extent of the atrocities, committed against females in many Asian and African countries, as narrated in Half the Sky. The authors, Nicolas Kristof and his wife Sheryl WuDunn, have tirelessly documented episodes of human suffering. They describe the enslavement of young girls and women in brothels, genital mutilation, gang-rapping, honor killing and other deprivations. Women, especially those of lower socioeconomic status, lack essential medical care and have no idea about the existence of birth control availability. It is surprising to me to learn how many people are being repressed because of their gender. The Chinese proverb that states \"women hold up half the sky\" makes as much sense to me as Hitler's assertion that women fit only for housekeepers and breeders. I could never find a logical explanation why the German forbade me to attend school and I am saddened to learn that so many young girls nowadays are being deprived of basic education. I had been repressed and oppressed during the German occupation of Poland 1939-1945. As a teenager, I had seen the worst that man can do. I saw the Germans looting, expropriating, beating, torturing, shooting, hanging, burning alive, babies choked or smashed to death, starving and other unimaginable acts of extreme wickedness carried out against innocent people. I witnessed and experienced enslavement in enforced labor and concentration camps. The most decent and compassionate person in my life was my stepmother, a female. The German who risked her life for me, thirty times, was a female. After the liberation from concentration camps, the first person who had offered me shelter was a German female. Although there were some vicious German female guards in Auschwitz, and in other concentration camps, most German women were less inclined to savagery than men. Adolph Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse Tung and Pol Pot, the most infamous dictators, in recent history, who had caused the death of tens of millions, were all males. When women are mistreated, men are intrinsically adversely affected. When women, who are the half of the population, are marginalized it affects adversely the entire population. Kristof and WuDunn deserve our gratitude for sharing their observations and personal interviews with so many affected victims and their benefactors. The authors bring to light the devastating problems facing millions of girls and women, but simultaneously with suggestive practical solutions to those problems. Education could bring emancipation for all women. The U.S. allocates $1 billion for every 1,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan. I am not sure that such additional expenses will grand us more security here in the U.S. and/or bring more democracy to the Afghan people. I am however convinced that $1 billion invested in providing education to thousands of Afghan or Pakistan children and adults about health, hygiene, human rights, women and girls' rights, will eventually diminish sex trafficking, and the affliction of female genitals cutting. Women will enrich the countries where they live and contribute to create a better world for the beneficiaries and benefactors alike. Roshaneh Zafars, an educated Pakistani woman, says (page 191)\"if I were prime minister for a day, I would put all our resources in education\" The authors lead us to pay attention to things that are disgusting. Readers are exhorted to get involved, to help financially and otherwise to put an end to the abuse of women wherever it still prevails. The authors deserve our recognition for their dedication to human rights, especially women rights. Half The Sky is an excellent literary work to enlighten all of us. The reader will be inspired and motivated to reach out to women born in countries not of their choice. It is a reference book how to help oppressed women via accountably charitable organizations. Let women's creative potential ripen! Alter Wiener, author \"From a Name to A Number\"", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "This book came to me highly recommended, so I was somewhat surprised at how terrible the book was. Kristof and DuWunn have taken timely and important topics, such as human trafficking and lack of educational opportunities for women, and turned them into opportunities for the reader to (1) marvel at how brave Nicholas Kristof is, and (2) feel better about one's self by sending money. The writing is heavily paternalistic, and the victims are portrayed largely as objects that serve the story rather than full human beings. In a book that argues against women and girls being seen as objects, Kristof practically pats himself on the back for paying for young women (to free them--although one returns to her pimp), which just perpetuates the market view of women as objects, commodities. Rape victims are named, pictures of women in operating rooms are shown, and the privacy of these victimized women is not respected in the way that would be demanded for western subjects. Most women in the book are referred to by their first name, most men (especially western men) are referred to by their last names. There are exceptions, but even in sections dealing just with Americans the men are more likely to be referred to with their last names and the women are written of more casually. The lack of consistency (if not outright contradictions) regarding real, workable solutions to the multitude of problems presented in the book was especially frustrating. There is constant proselytizing for more education for girls (it is one of the main points of the book), but then in a chapter on improving rural health care the authors write, \"One sensible response [to the lack of doctors in rural areas] is to start training programs in Africa that produce many more health care professionals, but in two- or three-year programs that don't grant MDs that allow the graduates to find jobs abroad.\" So, besides making extremely broad generalizations about an entire diverse continent, the authors think Africans should be educated enough to help themselves but not enough to participate in the opportunities of the world? Up to this point in the book we have been led to believe that we should look down on foreign cultures that don't believe in educating their girls to the same level as their boys, but now Kristof and DuWunn argue for essentially the same thing-- educating Africans less than Westerners? The authors seem to be writing for a U.S. audience, but there is no discussion of why the U.S., a developed, non-Muslim, country with equal voting rights, pretty good health care, and education for women, still has non-negligible problems with human trafficking, violence against women, and with disparate quality in maternal health. We have outlawed brothels (in most states), and yet there is still a problem with women and girls being forced into prostitution against their will. Human trafficking in the U.S. is a problem, even if the majority of the victims come from other countries. Why don't the authors discuss this when proposing better education, harsher laws against brothel owners, and women speaking up as solutions? Clearly, there is much more depth to all of these issues than the authors are willing or able to go into. The bottom line is that this is an important book topic, but it has been mangled in the execution both by incomplete and inconsistent explanation of the issues and by paternalistic, ethnocentric writing. While there are some concrete suggestions for how to move forward on these issues, there are also statements such as, \"If you're a parent, take your kids not just to London but also to India or Africa-or to the other side of the tracks in your own hometown.\" As though everyone interested in helping others has the disposable income to travel the world and lives on the \"right\" side of the tracks. I do hope that more people learn about these human rights issues, but I wish they would do so from a source that does a much better job of humanizing the victims and presenting the complexities of poverty, sexism, religion and politics that perpetuate these crimes.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "There is no doubt that this is an important book. As the authors state, the treatment of women in developing nations is not just a women's rights issue--it is a human rights issue. Educating women and giving them status as human beings will go a long way toward raising those in the poorest parts of the world out of abject poverty. The authors recount many deeply disturbing stories, but I believe they are stories that must be told. If those of us with wealth are to be made to care, we must know what is happening in the world outside of our own middle-class lives. Despite the horrors that many of the girls and women featured in the book have suffered, there is hope here too: many uplifting stories of women making strides toward equality, starting their own businesses, freeing themselves from oppression. The authors also offer positive examples of ways to make a real change in the world--through microfinance, sponsorships, and the like. Their focus on the grassroots programs that actually work (as opposed to bloated aid programs which often don't) is inspiring. That said, I had two main concerns with this book which prevent me from giving it five stars: 1) The tone that the book takes toward men. I recognize women have been oppressed for a long time, and it is so important for us to have a voice and be seen as human beings. But I think that can be done without disparaging men. It seems that making the world a better place should be something that both sexes attempt to take together--it is not an either-or situation. The majority of the men in this book are represented as drunken, abusive, oppressive tyrants who waste family resources on beer and prostitutes, while the women are brilliant but uneducated women who would shine and change the world if only they had the opportunity. The authors seem to argue that the women behave the way they do due to lack of education--which I agree with--but that the men behave the way they do because they are inherently lazy and selfish--which I do not. The problem on BOTH sides is a lack of education--let's find ways to educate men AND women, boys AND girls and then perhaps both sexes can rise to the occasion of supporting their families and caring for their children. 2) The book takes some shots at political conservatives. I hesitate to include this comment, because the authors appear to have gone to some effort to be as balanced as possible, and I appreciate that. They state a few times that evangelical movements have done great good. But there are a handful of comments made throughout the book that left a bad taste in my mouth. There aren't many of them, but I wish they weren't there at all. Examples: \"One of George W. Bush's few positive international legacies ...\" \"Publicity about Pakistan's harassment of Mukhtar was embarrassing to the Bush administration, so [they put pressure on Pakistan to make it stop]\" \"One of the challenges in curbing the virus is a suspicion of condoms held by many conservatives.\" \"Americans of faith should try as hard to save the lives of African women as the lives of unborn fetuses.\" (While I agree wholeheartedly with the last statement, the implication here is unfair. People of faith support a myriad of causes and charities.) It is unfortunate that politics are brought into this at all, because the problems described transcend political or religious differences, and there are effective ways of helping women that we can all agree on and fight for. On the whole, however, these concerns are minor compared to the scope of the book and what it is trying to address. Certainly read it, and be changed by it.", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "I've admired the work of Nicholas Kristof, columnist for the New York Times, for quite a while. I appreciate his tireless work of speaking up like few can about the plight of the poor and oppressed. It was only a matter of time, then, before I got around to reading the recent bestseller he wrote with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn. It's called \"Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.\" The book is excellently written, as one might expect from a Pulitzer Prize-winning duo, but that doesn't mean it's easy to read. The stories of unthinkable hardship endured by women are sobering, if not depressing. The scope of the problem is immense, from sex trafficking to honor killings to rape to an utter lack of opportunity in decision-making at times in even the smallest matters. But fortunately, we're presented with examples - though often small, isolated, and under-funded - of remarkable women making a real difference within their spheres of influence. I am grateful for the contribution this book makes and it's quite encouraging to me that in an era of books like Twilight and I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell, a book of substance about difficult but important matters becomes a national bestseller. I hope millions more read it. But I do have a couple of criticisms. The title comes from the Chinese proverb, \"Women hold up half the sky.\" And of course it's an overdue thing to focus a book like this on the half of the world population that is, to a greater or lesser extent, largely oppressed. But while it's not at all politically correct to do so, I have to wonder, what about those who hold up the other half of the sky? The contributions that women can and do make to society are legion, and it's undeniable in the field of international development and aid that women have an exponentially better track record in many areas. It's no accident that the vast majority of microloan recipients in developing nations, for instance, are women. But borrowing from the pages of groundbreaking Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, the oppressors need liberation just as much as the oppressed. Indeed, history has repeatedly shown that when oppressed peoples \"rise up\" in a revolution of any sort, it's not all that surprising when the tables turn, the roles reverse, and we're left not with peace and justice but with nothing more than a new set of oppressors and oppressed. We need to do better than that. So, as a matter of principle, I wish Kristof and WuDunn would have focused a bit more on what it might look like for men and women to begin holding up the sky together, cooperatively, with mutual respect. As it is, very little is said about the role men should play in the world they envision. (Interestingly, I should add, the tagline on the book website reads, \"Women aren't the problem, they're the solution along with men.\" Perhaps since publication they have given mutuality some additional thought.) There's another sense in which the book fails - or paradoxically illustrates - its moniker. As one who grew up in Latin America and whose work involves a daily analysis of media coverage of world events, it is clear to me that Latin America doesn't get a sliver of the attention it deserves. Apart from beheadings in Mexico and the latest inflammatory sound bites from Chavez, one is consistently hard-pressed to find out through traditional media what's taking place south of the United States on the American continent. Kristof and WuDunn, unfortunately, don't help matters. The stories of oppression and opportunity they tell are largely from Africa and Asia, with a few examples from the Middle East and the very occasional reference to Latin America. So if you're interested in those who hold up the sky in the western half of the world, you'll have to look elsewhere, and I'm warning you now: it might take some work. All things considered, however, Half the Sky is excellent, challenging, at times sickening, eventually inspiring, and all around quite important. [...]", "id": "3377866011"}
{"review": "I first saw the authors on the Oprah show and was impressed and intrigued. This is a life changing book and it's both easy and hard to read. It's easy in that it's intelligently and thoughtfully done. It's hard because life for women in most of the world is so awful. You can know that intellectually, but reading the specific stories and realizing the day-to-day life horrors for so many is heartbreaking. The greatest thing about this book is that the authors give the reader the tools to DO something and make a difference. Charities and organizations that they themselves have seen on the ground in many places DOING good work and helping. Again, this book is hard to read...I had to stop midway through (it was about 3AM) and I sat and cried for a good hour. As a female, I really realized (I already KIND of knew this) that to be born in the USA makes you LITERALLY one of the luckiest women on earth. We have so much here and we have so much to do elsewhere. This book illustrates how this is truly a human rights tragedy, how we ALL can do something about it and we must use our voices and resources to help. It's our job to help. This book definitely wakes you up, makes you present and calls you to action. There's no way you can read it and go back to normal. I plan on giving this to all of the strong women I know.

After reading this book and seeing all the trouble Shelby's mind-reading gets her into, I don't think I'd want that one. Perhaps her other special ability is being able to avoid being killed.

Things like \"produce isle\", \"pealed out of the parking lot\", \"loosing my mind\", \"who's car is that?\", and \"you should see a councilor\" (that is a lawyer - what she needed to see was counselor) really bugged me and distracted me from the story. I noted 14 of these types of errors. Normally it doesn't bother me that much, but in this case, there were just too many.

It reads as if someone used spell check and decided that was sufficient editing. I got about a third of the way through this book before I gave up. I had no idea who the main character was. Her relationships with her family were barely sketched in, and I have no idea what motivates this character. I was also irritated by her anger at her husband over another woman being interested in him even though he did not reciprocate, while she's being swoony over the police officer.

{"review": "One of the main reasons I selected this novel was due, in part, to the cover. People really do judge books by its cover. Having said that, I wasn't that thrilled with the story. But to be fair, I thought this story was going to be a real page turner seeing as how the main character, Shelby Nichols, was on her way to the grocery store to pick up some carrots to make chicken noodle soup for her family. While going down the aisles, she grabs her carrots and gets some other items, takes her basket to the checkout line, and she hears a loud POW! A crazed man with a gun is holding up the bank, and begins shooting all over the place, and instead of Shelby ducking and taking cover like the other patrons did, she stood and watched--out of shock or could that be pure stupidity, whichever you prefer? At any rate, the next thing she remembers is a paramedic over her asking her questions, but she could barely make out what he was saying. She just wanted her carrots, but what was that trickling down her forehead? Blood! What had happened and why couldn't she just go home? Turns out Shelby was grazed by one of the stray bullets by the armed robber, and as luck would have it, or a curse, as some might think, she begins to know exactly what everyone is thinking, even though their mouths aren't moving, but she hears their thoughts. Now, that sounds exciting, right? Well, it was until the story seemed to take on an immaturity level and Shelby just seemed to get dumber as the pages grew. I found myself not liking this character, and I so wanted too. She did things that were just plain stupid, and there were things that happened in different scenarios that didn't seem to add up or there wasn't any rhyme or reason behind it. The story was written well, but I wish the main character wasn't so quirky. This isn't a bad read, I guess it just wasn't for me.

The portraits of some minor characters were more complex than expected, as were some of the genuinely surprising plot twists. I had a hard time believing the heroine was in her mid-thirties and the mother of two older kids; she seemed much younger to me. Actually, she seemed slightly stunted. She didn't know some fairly basic social covenants and had no real moral compass. She also seemed awfully isolated. Yes, she is supposed to be a full time mom, but her kids are pre-teen and young-teen. What does she do why they are in school all day? And why doesn't she have any friends?

{"review": "Over the weekend, I described Lynn Austin's recent book, While We're Far Apart, like an intricate symphony. It begins with a rather straightforward melody: Penny watches as the man she pines for leaves for War on the eve of the American involvement in WWII and offers recklessly to take care of his two motherless children in hopes of securing his love upon his return from duty. Shaking feelings of worthlessness long instilled from her over-bearing parents, Penny steps outside the front door of the house she has always lived in and charges toward a new future. On the eve of his departure, widowed Eddie tries to ignore the pleas of his two young children begging him to stay. They don't want Penny to move into their Brooklyn Apartment and usurp their dead mother's space. They, instead, want their father to stay home from the war. Eddie leaves to converse with Jacob Mendel, his Jewish landlord and another tune strings in. Jacob's wife Miriam and Eddie's wife Rachel were both killed in the same untimely accident. As ramification, Jacob has lost his faith in Hashem ---- God seems so far away although the rabbi and his wife try desperately to tug the former elder back to the life of the synagogue. And then, climactically and with discordance, the local synagogue is prey to an act of arson and a seemingly faraway hatred is brandished like a cymbal- jolt into the present. The tune evokes a haunting change as more instruments are melded into each deft cadence and more bars are added to prolong the unraveling symphony. Dense orchestration including the introduction of new friends; wisps of letters from Jacob's son and his wife in war-torn, Holocaust Hungary, and deep whispers of secrets from loved ones near and far merge to create a seamless piece. There are themes of love and pursuit; of anger, of hatred of a clashing war. Of the brisk touch of this world and the world beyond. It is an almost perfect rendering of a tumultuous time. Austin never writes without an over-arching theme and in While We're Far Apart, the seeming absence of God is most resonant. Jacob followed and meditated on the words of the Torah steadfastly only to find the seams of his world tearing and his life falling apart. Penny isn't sure how to believe in God: when she repeats over and over again all of her shortcomings. Young Esther and her wordless brother Peter go through the motions of a Sunday Schooled upbringing attempting to reconcile the death of their mother with the faith she seemed to inspire in them. All lives collide and cross--- and yet the Almighty seems painfully silent. While We're Far Apart is a magnificent exposition of God in all of his seeming silences. Is He there when we can't hear Him? ---There whether in the materialization of Christian or Jewish tradition? Even amidst a Holocaust recalling the treacherous reign of Haman and the unlikely heroism of Queen Esther? Amidst persecution, death and unwarranted vandalism? How can we pick up the pieces of our faith if we're not sure where faith leads? What is God doing behind the scenes and how are His silences even more telling than His revelation? The end of the song, the end of the book, empowers the reader to think of God in a personal and enraptured way. He can handle our anger and our despair: our lashings out and our pain..... for it is in these moments that we test our faith to breaking point, shirk any complacency and recognize that years later, when the glass is undimmed, that He was there working out the technical aspects, the last strains and chords of melody and sewing together a music so beautiful our human ears could scarce imagine it.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "The novel opens in Brooklyn, New York in the fall of 1943 during WWII. Eddie Schaffer age 33 and his two children, 12-year-old Esther and 9-year-old Peter live in a small apartment upstairs from their landlord, Jacob Mendel. A year prior, Eddie's wife Rachel was killed together with his landlord's wife, Miriam. Eddie is having difficulty coping with Rachel's death and decides to enlist in the army throwing the entire family for a loop. The children had already lost their mother and feared losing their father in battle. Eddie's mother, Grandma Shaffer, lives next door to the Goodrich family who has a daughter Penny, aged 24. Penny's parents are older, quite strict and have sheltered Penny her entire life, always telling her she had no more sense than a green bean. As a result poor Penny suffers from terrible fear of being on her own and afraid of the world at large, although she holds a job as a ticket agent at the local bus station. Unbeknownst to Eddie, Penny has had a crush on him for years and years and always wished Eddie had married her instead of Rachel. She cried her eyes out when she learned Eddie was getting married. Now enlisted in the Army and ready to head off for basic training, Eddie needs someone to care for young Esther and Peter. His own mother, Grandma Shaffer is adamant that there is no way possible she can look after two young children and is completely dead set against Eddie enlisting but Eddie had already enlisted sending Grandma into quite a dramatic tizzy. Penny steps forward and offers to care for the children herself with her underlying motive being that Eddie will fall in love with her and marry HER this time. Soon Penny and children are ensconced in Eddie's apartment, living above Jacob Mendel who is suffering with his own problems. His son, Avraham traveled to Hungary five years ago to study the Torah, met and married Sarah and they had a daughter together whom they named Fredeleh, but now all three of them are missing! Young Esther is struggling in Sunday school asking the teacher why there are wars, why her mother died in the car accident and asks: \"Why doesn't God just kill all the evil people himself\". Her teacher tells the class they should pray for their loved ones who are off fighting in the war but Esther can't accept that as an answer and inquires: \"Even if we pray and pray, God doesn't stop people from dying, so what good does it do\"? How many of us have asked that very same question during our own journey of faith? In the meantime, poor little Peter seems to have lost his ability to talk once his father went off to war and is frightened. He writes a note on his chalkboard for his sister saying: \"I don't know what's wrong. I try to talk and nothing comes out. Help me!\" Esther doesn't know what to do and won't ask Penny for any help as she despises Penny and thinks that she is trying to replace her mother. But Penny, at this point, couldn't be much help as she herself has no self-confidence, always telling herself she can't do things and always makes a mess of everything. These put-downs are old tapes playing in her head that her parents have pounded into her since she was a young child. They continue to treat Penny as a child and make her feel as though everything that happens is her fault. Yet somehow she found the inner strength and courage to move out of her parents home and care for Eddie's children. Downstairs, Jacob Mendel has lost his Jewish faith completely. Esther and Peter visit Mr. Mendel after school each day to help him around the house. Esther begins to seek answers about God, prayer and faith from Mr. Mendel but he doesn't know how to help Esther or what to say to her. He too has lost faith in his religion and his God. He finally explains the story of Joseph and the coat of many colours and tells the children that: \"Faith is believing even when you cannot see it\". But, does Jacob himself still really believe that? Due to Esther's persistence and questions, and Peter's sad eyes, Jacob was beginning to come out from under the veil of darkness and unbelief he had been under for the past year and a half. Jacob decides that he and the children will invite Penny in celebrating \"Purim\", which is the feast of \"Queen Esther\" from the Bible. Keeping with tradition, Jacob tells the children that instead of him telling the story, they will each read the story together with everyone taking a part. Of course, Esther will play the part of Queen Esther and Peter will be Hashem (The Man or God). They will also bake the traditional \"Hamantaschen\" (cookies). During Jacob's planning of the party he realizes he is truly happy. As the relationship between Mr. Mendel, the children and Penny begins to grow, they come to learn together about faith, loss, love, and forgiveness. There are so many other exciting parts in this story that I don't want to give anything else away. But there are a few morals in this story that I believe are important for all of us to remember. We need to remember that God is always there, even when we can't see Him or hear Him. Even when we think our prayers are not being heard, they are, just not always in the way we'd like them to be. It is and has always been God's will that shall be done, not ours! Even during silence and painful hardships, God is still there. Sometimes we must travel through hardships in our lives in order for us to learn something or to understand something. Without hardships we wouldn't be able to grow in our faith. We need to trust God and live our lives as humble servants, even when we cannot see, even when we feel tired of looking and want to give up. God is ALWAYS there, even when He is silent. This is also an important story that talks about the atrocities that were placed upon the people of Jewish faith during the war, in my opinion, one of the saddest and most hurtful of all times in history. Lynn Austin has once again written a riveting story. A story that you'll remember long after the last page has been turned. It's the type of book you'll want to read again and again. This is one story you can't miss!!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Excited by the description and the stellar reviews, I was eager to pick this one up. It was a quick read but in the end lacked the complexity and content that one would expect. I might recommend this book for a mature 6th-grader writing a book report, but as an adult I was disappointed. While the book is clearly character driven (the descriptions of the \"Brooklyn\" setting could have been Anywhere, USA), the characters themselves seemed to be so stereotypical and poorly developed beyond the basics: the struggling middle-class family, the young enthusiastic soldier, the orthodox Jew, the closed-minded bigot, etc. The letters from Hungary, describing the plight of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation, felt mostly like a tool for the author to educate the reader about basic WWII history rather than supplement the story. What was most unappealing was the simplistic nature of the characters and dialogue; essentially boiled down to a young adult level but with the serious overtones of an adult topic. Overall the development of the book was overly thin and predictable, and the ending a little too saccharine for me to swallow. As if real life could be wrapped up in such a neat little bow!", "id": "17"}

Tells a wonderful story of different people, from different families and faiths, who come together while WW2 rages. I started it yesterday, wanting to savor it, but throughout today, I kept putting it down and picking it right back up again. I don't feel, as one reviewer suggested, that it was like a history lesson. I learned a couple things I did not know, but everything blended into a beautiful story of finding love, lost love and new love. I am not the best writer as far as reviewing, but I highly recommend this book as a touching read. I will be looking for more of Lynn Austins books.

{"review": "I love Lynn Austin, so I had high hopes for this book. Though I don't think it was quite as good as some of her other books (Refiner's Fire series), I did enjoy it. I love that the \"Far Apart\" theme was carried out in many ways through the various characters and the fact that Mr. Mendel kept reinforcing the idea that we should stop at nothing to find those we love. The author did a good job developing the characters. I genuinely cared about what happened to them and felt the anguish of Esther as she desperately searched the news for information about the area her father was. Mr. Mendel was probably my favorite character. I felt his heartache throughout the book and loved how he grew as a person throughout the story.", "id": "17"}

{"review": "GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I am having the time of my life right now. My facebook page dedicated to the blog has hit over 2000 likes so throwing a big party on October 4th. So having fun getting authors together and scheduling their mini take overs . Also reading up a storm. Have so many books coming down the pipe. Might have to hook up with some awesome reviewers. So todays book is THE WAYEVIL DOES (the first book in the Eisenbrey trilogy:) By Amara Draska BOOK BLURB Rebecca Reis considers abandoning her career as a novelist until she begins writing about convicted serial killer Thomas Eisenbrey. Nicknamed the Hunter because of his penchant for targeting groups of hunters in the forest, Eisenbrey is the worst kind of psychopath. He is crafty, aloof, at times possessing a charm that is almost hypnotizing, and he’s wheedling his way into her mind. As her interviews with him in the Washington State Penitentiary progress, Rebecca finds herself having feelings for the last man in the world that she should, forcing her to ignore her attraction to the detective who is also vying for her affection. But when the Hunter escapes, she worries—who will he hunt next? MY REVIEW I was so excited when I got this book. It has everything a little bit of romance a hot detective a psychopath killer named THE HUNTER who is rather dashing and charming but also very crafty. He is slowly getting into the mind of Rebecca the reporter sent to interview him. She is sent to the State pen to interview him and as the interviews progress she finds that she is starting to fall for the debonair killer But there is also the very hot detective that also wants her. But she is scared that when the hunter escapes who will he go after and will she live to see another day. The author takes us on a ride that will end up reading all night long. This has a romance, serial killers , murders and a twist of paranormal. The characters are so well written . You feel for them and start to care for them. I must admit I did like Thomas even though he was a serial killer and probably want to stab me to death. He did kind a get under your skin while you read. I didn't think that all the aspects would work but it did. Even the twist of paranormal . It does and trust me you will be drawn into hell and back and yes there is a cliff hanger but not a big of one that will make you scream. This book will keep you up all night reading. Hope you are ready for a big book hangover. So check out this book and check out the great story lines characters and wonderful plots. I promise you will not be disappointed", "id": "18"}

If you're going in anyway, prepare yourself to suspend disbelief beyond the usual for contemporary fiction, because this one has so many plot holes it's ridiculous. The hero promised us partway through that he would get answers on those plot holes, and he failed miserably on keeping that promise.

He has used his previous experience as both soldier and policeman to excellent effect and he draws the reader in to a world that few talk about ... experimentation to enhance human strength and abilities.

I could get over the bizarre backstory of Jax getting messed over (out of a stunt contract) by a woman he was dating. I could try and overlook the \"I can't be seen with you\" text from Lexi which should have ended the story (who would want to be with such a mean and flawed woman). What I couldn't get over was the oddly fabricated and ineffective point of tension that was suppose to keep the hero and heroine apart. Romance books are far from believable, and are often meant to offer a total escape. That said, the storyline should make sense and the point of contention that causes drama should have an element of believability. It this case, it made absolutely no sense whatsoever that Lexi couldn't be with Jax, and that any fashion house would shun her dating him (or have a say). Most publicity is good publicity, so it would have actually been a huge plus for the added media attention.

Super fine and sexy, rugged and tatted, Jax is more than that rough-looking bad boy image. He's also one very sweet hero. The kind of man who needs care and wants love really badly, and I love those heroes. I do love me a needy hero. Who can resist a man who's open and ready to love? Jax very much wants a girl who will love and respect him, treat him right, and not walk all over him. Now, don't think he's a wuss. He's not. He's just used to being used, and I felt for him. He's had his share of action, lots of beautiful women, always attracted to their flashy exterior, but now he's going to turn it around and find himself a woman who can be sweet and kind and not use him for gain and ulterior motive. How he meets the heroine is interesting and fun and playful, kind of secret, with some flirty and naughty texts exchanged with a stranger. It also allows him to feel that he's getting to know this woman first and not be distracted by the exterior. For her part, this is exactly what Lexi also wants. She wants to be anonymous, to have a little fun with a hot stranger, all without risking involvement. But you know how that's going to work out! These two are damaged, or jaded, in their own ways, and you know they are perfect for each other. There is a bit of going back and forth, letting doubt creep in and sabotage a good thing. Is Jax's image bad for Lexi's career? Does Lexi want something from Jax, to use him? That sort of thing. And in the end, it's all about taking a risk and letting go; being a little reckless and seeing what happens. I kind of wanted a little more at the ending, which to me felt just a bit rushed. I think sometimes authors maybe underestimate the appeal of an epilogue, and I'm definitely one of those readers who likes an extra kiss there at the end. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this romance and this author, a lot. Loved the hero! Thought Jax was so sweet and fine, rough-edged but vulnerable. The romance is sweet, and the sex scenes are hot, erotic and detailed. This couple sparked the page, and it was arousing to read. I liked the secondary characters, too, all interesting and adding to the story, with Rubi being a true scene-stealer, and I can't wait for her story.

{"review": "What happens when Hollywood's bad boy in hiding meets little miss prim and proper? Hotness. Hotness happens. Lots-and-lots of hotness. Reckless is the first book in Skye Jordan's Renegades series and was unputdownable. Be warned, you will not want to put aside Jax and Lexie's story for anything. I had things to do yesterday, most of which did not get done simply because \"one more chapter\" turned into another, which turned into another, and so on. Not only was Reckless a smokin' hot read, but both Lexie and Jax were very engaging characters with issues they needed to overcome to make their relationship work. Jax (who happened to give me a major case of the swoons) is an actor turned stunt man who has been screwed over one too many times. He has trust issues out the yin yang and certainly isn't looking for more than a roll in the hay. Did I mention Jax is beyond smexy and quite the dirty talker? \"We've got all night to explore the many different kinds of orgasms that exist. And no, baby, they're not all the same.\" Lexie is a haute couture dress designer who hasn't had a vacation day in years. On her flight to the biggest business meeting of her life, she sees Jax. He's everything she wants but nothing she needs. She can't stop thinking about him so using a bad ass app her friend, Rubie, designed, she contacts him anonymously. Sparks fly between them and I fell in lust. Lexie knows Jax is no good for her and could do damage to her career but what would one night with him really do? Reckless was off the charts hot and I fell hard for Jax. *fans self* A lot of time in contemporary romance I'll find myself liking but not loving both of the main characters; that wasn't the case here. Jax and Lexie were both fantastic, had a great plot to work with, and I loved them together. Honestly I was a bit sad when the book ended as I wanted more; more of them and more of the world. Luckily Renegades is a series and Reckless was just the beginning so I'll get more of the super smexy world Skye Jordan created.

{"review": "Be careful with this one, it's sure to melt your e-reader...not to mention your heart. Lexi LaCroix controls every aspect of her life - from her painstakingly detailed wedding gown designs to her love life. She's pulled herself from the dirt poor place she grew up in to one of the most sought after wedding apparel designers in the country. Now, more than ever, she must be careful about her actions. She's under intense scrutiny due to a possible lucrative partnership with Martina Galliano - the woman who can make all of Lexi's dreams come true. Unfortunately, the stress and pressure has finally gotten to Lexi. As owner and designer, she often puts in 14+ hour days stitching and mending her designs by hand. With the gain in notoriety, her drive to be the best and attain her dreams has burned her out. Now, with the most important deal of her life in the works, she's running out of designs...and inspiration. Jax Chamberlain. --Hang on, let me say it again. Jax Chamberlain.-- Former actor turned stuntman, Jax is used to women using him to get what they want. An audition, an introduction, an investment. He's been burned too many times and is quite simply done with sex-on-heels women who use him for connections to the entertainment industry. When Lexi sees Jax while leaving L.A. for New York - and is presented with an app that allows her to see the phone numbers of those around her - she does something reckless and anonymously texts him. The texts turn quickly from curious to flirtatious to smoldering. LEXI: What kind of sex do you like? JAX: I like the fiery, fast sex so passionate your vision blurs. JAX: I like wild, frantic, have-to-have-you sex that burns you alive. JAX: I like deep, driving sex where sweat drips off my chin, rolls down your spine, and tickles the dip between your *** cheeks. JAX: I like secret sex in naughty places, and naughty places to have secret sex. JAX: I like the kind of sex that includes sliding my tongue into all your very tight spaces. JAX: I like any kind of sex that drives animalistic sounds from your throat. Lexi must decide if she's willing to put her job on the line for what promises to be the wildest, most daring fling of her life. A one night affair does little to dim the attraction between them. Is Jax willing to let go and trust a woman who may just be using him? Can Lexi take a chance on a Hollyword bad boy? Whooo, boy Reckless took me completely off guard. I was not expecting anything extraordinary, I'd never read anything by the author before so I was shocked to find how much I enjoyed Reckless. Skye Jordan is obviously a talented writer and has earned her place as one of my go-to authors. Most engaging about the story, if we're going to get down and dirty, is the sex. I had to read this book twice because it was that good. Jax brought everything a man is supposed to bring to the table. He stripped Lexi of her control and in return allowed her to take back control of her career. He was sweet, passionate, and was the perfect dirty talker. *sah-woon* Then he eased the need by pushing his hand low. She gasped in surprise and excitement. At the feel of having a man's hand between her legs. A real man. The kind of man who made her hot and wet and needy. The kind of man who wasn't afraid to take charge or give real pleasure. When they meet again, both begin to drop their guards. Their connection and attraction is too strong to deny. Jax fears that his reputations will damage Lexi's chances at securing the partnership, so even though he's grown to care for her, he tries to let her go. --I loved him in this moment. He doesn't want her to suffer at the hands of the paparazzi and the vicious rumor mill, so he let her go. I loved his point of view. I don't know what it is about being inside a man's head, but it always makes a novel so great to me. Perhaps because I am able to understand their motivations and actions so much more. Either way, Jordan did a great job at writing Jax. I'm still salivating. I'm also excited to learn that this is a series. I can guarantee, based on the description, that the next book will be just as spectacularly crafted as the first. More devil-may-care bad*** men who know how to take care of their women - in more ways than one. I cannot wait to see what's next.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Bought and read this book based on all the 5-star ratings. The hot, steamy sex scenes are good but the story stinks. The contrived plot makes absolutely no sense to me. It seems to me that the author had one goal - sales from writing mommy porn. All that was needed was a few tears from a \"sweet\" heroine and plenty of graphic sex and voila! - lots of 5 star ratings! Give me a break and give me a story line that works, while you're at it! Complete waste of my time and money!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "There was nothing in this book that grabbed at me or pulled me in. It started off interesting but it was basically the main characters talking to friends or co-workers. Even if I don't like a book I will breeze through to the end and this one I couldn't even do that. So boring!", "id": "17"}
{"review": "Yes- this is a hot book- if you mean by that REALLY GRAPHIC sex. No romance just REALLY GRAPHIC, anatomically specific descriptive sex. Along with the word f*ck. Every page, f*ck and / or REALLY GRAPHIC sex. Very low standards of storytelling, romance writing, or just plain old use of the English vocabulary.", "id": "17"}
{"review": "3.5 stars So let us just say that the book was just okay. We loved Jax Chamberlin and just thought that Skye Jordan could have done so much more with his character than Lexi. Jax Chamberlin, ex-actor, undercover wealthy, now movie stunt man is HOT and possibly every woman's dream. But he has been used by the best of them...wanting a role in a movie, to be introduced to the next big star, or just a little cash to tide them over. Jax is tired of being used and he is avoiding women all together. Meanwhile, Lexi is trying to find her way in the fashion world. She is making killer couture dresses for a hefty price, but she is ready to take her career to the next level. Taking her career to the next level could mean no time for fun and definitely no time for a man like Jax Chamberlin. Truthfully, Lexi thinks that Jax's image is all wrong for her career. And that pissed us off that she would judge him by his appearance and job description. Snob much Lexi!!! Well the story does have its good moments - you know Lexi caves in to Jax's sex appeal. And we loved the way he turned her out. Go Jax - Go Jax - Go Jax! 'He groaned, his hands moving over her like he couldn't touch her fast enough. His mouth eating at her mouth like he couldn't get enough of her taste. He pressed her against a wall, but she couldn't remember moving from the middle of the living room. His hips sank deep between her legs, and a fierce shot of pleasure arched her back. She broke the kiss on a moan.' Bayyybeee can you say Jax was putting it on her. So what didn't we like about it...well it may have been a little too much talk about the fashion world. Like really we didn't care about fabric or her making dresses...and we didn't need it to understand the chemistry between her and Jax. And a lot of scenes with Lexi made the story kind of boring. But Lexi had a kick a%& best friend, Rubi. Why is it that the best friend is always the carefree, fun person? It is settled we only want to be the sideline best friend and not the spotlight. LOL! Hell it was Rubi's great invention that got Lexi and Jax together in the first place. We will say that Lexi redeemed herself at the end...what she planned at her fashion show was so very sweet! But we are not even going to give you a hint...you have to read the book!", "id": "17"}
