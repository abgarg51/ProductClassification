{"review": "I read some of the negative reviews and gave this a try anyway. Fearing that I may end up getting a used repackaged product (as mentioned in some of the negative reviews) I made sure to pick up a TDS* water meter/tester as well. Not only to make sure I got a new filter from this seller, but also so I can test the various liquids used around my home. As I'd mentioned in my review for the TDS* water meter/tester, my tap water is hard so I used the baseline measurement (PPM's) of a bottle of Poland Spring water. My main concern about this filter or my refrigerator water line in general, was that it wasn't going to make too much of a difference drinking water from the tap versus one that came out of this filter. After my baseline measurements, my concerns were put at ease. Below are results from my tests: (measurements in PPM) 0-50 = Ideal drinking water 50-100 = Carbon filtered water 100-200 = Hard water 200-300 = Marginally acceptable 200-400 = Average tap water 400+ Very high TDS contaminant level --My household baseline-- Bottle of Poland Spring = 18 Tap Water = 281 Gatorade = 260 5 month old filter from my refrigerator water line = 240 New filter from my refrigerator water line = 200 Melted ice (4 hours) = 293 So what did I learn from this... My tap water isn't too bad, this particular filter can probably go another month or two, and I really need to clean my ice maker. The good news is that this filter removed 80+PPM's of TDS* from my tap. *TDS* - Total Dissolved Solids are the total amount of mobile charged ions, including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in a given volume of water.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "I've ordered and reordered this product many times from Amazon and the price is great online and the product is fully sealed and shipping has been great, etc. Both the GE brand and other brands fail to work more than a few weeks before they clog and water starts coming out very slowly. But I keep buying them because I want clean and safe water. Well, today I just got a TDS-3 Water Quality Meter (from Amazon) to test the quality of my water. It turns out that these GE filters are barely removing any particles from the tap water! Here are my results: Here are my results: Tap Water: 86 GE Smartwater filter on my refrigerator: 75 Instant hot water, being filtered first using a hot water filter: 85 Poland Springs bottled water: 25 Distilled water: 0 (ZERO!) The only question is: WHAT DO I DO NOW THAT I KNOW THIS? - Stop filtering my water? - Only drink Poland Springs? I plan on retesting many times, with a new filter on, under different various conditions, etc. But the preliminary news is that this GE filter barely does anything. The testing does not tell you what the contaminants are... it could be that the filter is removing harmful ones, yet returning charcoal from the filtering process? Or it could be the refrigerator is channeling the water around the filter instead of through it? A lot of thing could be going on... but one thing that wont be going on is me drinking much of the water coming out of the GE filter anymore! Time to find a MUCH better solution to the dirty water problem. Buyer beware. Get your own TDS tester to find out how things are working at your house. UPDATE: I've updated to three stars out of respect for a poster that explained that the filter is actually doing its job. I'm certainly no expert on this topic, but have respect for people that are. I'd still wish to have a device that filtered water at the same level one finds it in \"bottled water\" such as Poland Springs. How would I achieve that level of quality?", "id": "3741181"}

If you've got a refrigerator that uses one of these filters and the water's been coming out slow then it's probably time for a new filter. One word of advice: use a big water pitcher for the first use of the dispenser after the filter change - the pressure has to readjust and it will spit out a few huge blasts of water that will overwhelm your normal water glass. After the couple of big blasts though, you get constant good pressure, better than you remembered was even possible after the gradual slow down with your old filter.", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "This filter is rated at 750 gallons capacity. If the consumer uses one gallon of water per day in the form of water from the refrigerator dispenser and ice from the ice dispenser, the filter will last 750 days; i.e., just over TWO years. In general, there is no reason to replace the filter yearly, unless you have a really yuccky water source. In a small household of two adults, the filter should last considerably longer than two years. Furthermore, with the addition of a filtered water dispenser at the sink (such as a GE undercounter unit), the refrigerator filter would be functional for a few years. The undercounter units have a quite large capacity and some use two filter cartridges.", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "Lots of reviews on this site refer to the confusion regarding this replacement filter (UKF8001), so here are my observations on two matters: 1.) Which filter are we getting (750 Gallons vs 200 Gallons, etc) when we buy UKF8001? 2.) How frequently should we change it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gallon Capacity Rating ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Like everyone else, my box lists two different capacities (750 Gallon Rating & 200 Gallon Rating) * Underneath each gallon rating it says the number of contaminents reduced (12 & 17 respectively) * As others have shown in their photos, immediately below that, it lists a number of contaminents, with a checkmark as to whether the filter for that gallon rating filters each of the contaminents. Note that for the 750 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 12 and chlorobenzene is not checked. Note that for the 200 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 17 and cholorbenzene IS checked. Now, here's the key observation. On the front of my box it says in a bright pink callout \"Reduces 12 contaminents...\" Note that it does not say 17 contaminents, but 12. Also it does not mention chlorobenzene. From this I take it that UKF8001 filter that I received is rated 750 gallons, and does not filter chlorobenzene. I assume that if the filter were rated for 200 gallons and filtering chlorobenzene, then the box would be labeled on the front as filtering 17 contaminents, but I cannot prove this. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has a box that has such a designation on the front to see how their box differs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Change at 6 months or 12 months ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Regarding changing the filter at 1 yr vs 6 months, here's what my refrigerator manual said about that: \"The filter monitor system measures the amount of water that passes through the filter and alerts you to replace the filter. When 90% of the filter's rated life is used, the yellow (Order) light comes on. When 100% of the filter's rated life is used, the red (Replace) light comes on, and it is recommended that you replace the filter. For models without filter status lights, replace the filter every 6 months. Use replacement filter model 67003523; order Part Number 4396395.\" From this I take it that some refrigerators are advanced enough to measure the amount of water that has passed through the system and to make recommendations as to when to change the filter. To determine this, you would need to check your fridge manual. If your refrigerator has such a feature, then you can probably go by the fridge's recommendation. Also, I suspect some fridges just go by the date and alert you after 6 months or a year. Or for those fridges that have a usage monitoring system, perhaps they alert you after six months or a year even if you haven't reached your maximum capacity rating. For example, I have an advanced fridge with the capacity monitor. I installed UKF8001 the last two times, and each time the fridge has indicated a need to change the filter at just about 1 yr, even though there is no way we used 750 gallons in that time frame. Probably this is to ensure the filter gets changed regularly whether you have met the usage profile or not. Regarding the fact that the box is stamped at 6 months even though it can be used for a full year and is rated at 750 Gallons, here's my theory. The filter manufacturer says that without a usage monitoring feature, their recommendation is 6 months. Probably the manufacturer stamps 6 months on the outside of the box since that is the shortest and most generic case (and also so they can sell more filters. Lol.) But the frequency you should change the filter will depend on your particular fridge, your usage, and your water quality. Finally, although the filter works just fine, I deducted one point from the rating because the packaging causes so much needless confusion.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "This water filter produces great tasting water! I have always been a fan of Pur water filtration systems, so with this filter you get the great taste of Pur filtered water right out of your refrigerator. It lasts about 1 year and then a red light on the refrigerator comes on indicating that it is time to swap out the water filter. To be honest, the water didn't really taste bad at the year marker, so you might be able to get the filter to last longer than that. Can't say for sure, though, since we have always gone ahead and swapped it out anyways. It is super easy to install. It depends on your refrigerator, but on our Maytag the filter is on the inside of the refrigerator in the top back right corner. You open the filter door by pushing in the tab. Then turn the filter counter-clockwise to unscrew it. The filter will have some remaining water in it, so make sure that you keep it tilted up or you will have some water to wipe up. The new filter comes in shrink wrap plastic, so you take that off and then peal off the seal that covers the top of the filter. Insert the new filter where the old one was and turn clockwise to tighten. Don't over tighten it. Just get it snug. You will hear water rush into the filter as you are screwing it in. Then close the filter door. Last thing is to let some water run through the lines to remove all the air. I took a 1 gallon jug and just let the water fill it up. The instructions recommend running 4 gallons through to make sure you removed all the air. I only did 1 gallon and it seemed to be more than enough. That's it! Now you can just sit back and enjoy some clean filtered water. If you figure the price of buying bottled water vs. a new filter once a year, this is definitely a good deal at an average cost of about $2.50 a month.", "id": "3741181"}

Also, when I emptied it (you will have to empty it pretty much every time you use it, but what do you expect?)

{"review": "While it is obvious this very cheap and small vacuum is not the ideal main vacuum of choice for regular vacuum days or actual houses, this is an absolute perfect product for small jobs or, better yet, smaller spaces (especially if you have). It's lightweight and multiple use design and very good suction power all add up to a great deal that work extremely well. I live in a college dorm and got it on sale (Amazon probably won't let me say much else), and could not have been happier. Given the space I live (I live in a one person room) in, it is perfect and spending any more money on a \"proper\" vacuum would be an utter waste of money. This is perfect for small bedrooms, smaller areas, dorms, and quick clean up jobs, with multi function to suit many needs and situations. Performance wise, it works great. I don't have much else to say here. The vacuum sucks up crumbs and other types of debris with ease, so there's nothing else to say here. Sure, the vacuum doesn't actually suck up, ummm, egg yolks, or something, but it will no doubt suck up the majority of typical debris you would expect you would need to vacuum up. Add this to a variety of ways you can vacuum via design and you have quite a good performance product. As far as the design of the vacuum itself, well, I was very satisfied. First off, the thing is very light, which makes it easy to carry, lift, and transport. It's easy to put together, and you can store it by just removing the head and the handle at the end. This also means that you can use more than one vacuum. You can use a regular vacuum, or you can use it as a hand vacuum as well. The hand vacuum also comes with a small attachment for getting into tight spaces, intended for use with the hand vacuum. A few things to know before you purchase this vacuum. As you might expect, a vacuum this small is not for an actual house, so don't bother with this vacuum if you want to make it a vacuum you would use in a regular home. Another thing I HIGHLY recommends is to always clean the filter and empty the vacuum after every use. Being small, it takes no time whatsoever and should not detract you from purchasing it, but is a precaution that should be always taken to ensure that the vacuum is not damaged. Once again, I can't recommend this vacuum enough. For its designed purpose, it works extremely well. Pick it up, it's inexpensive and works wonders for your situations. *Since it is obvious that ALL products have the potential to stop working, I will update this review if the vacuum stops working.

{"review": "Here in my apt. I find that dust accumulates very quickly and attaches to corners as dust balls. I also have a cat, which simply put adds to the problem terribly. I NEEDED a vacuum that was very cheap so that I could solve this without much fuss. I was tired of using a broomstick, which just makes the dust fly all over! So, let me explain what the Dirt Devil Vacuum does. A usual scenario: My floor has one layer of tiny dust particles attached to it and on top, the dust that moves around and collect as dust balls and cat hair with that. The vacuum picks up this moving dust/hair layer. My point being that, you cannot expect to remove the tiny dust attached to the floor, which you'd remove with a mop. You coould kind of do it, but you'd have to move the vacuum slowly over the floor (I don't have the time for that, so it doesn't do it for me). The vacuum works for what I bought it for, quickly remove general dust and cat hair (which it does really well). - The vacuum is VERY light, which is great for moving it around fast. The little wheels move smoothly, though it is too bad they only move back and forth (...not a big problem, since the vacuum is light you can slide it over the floor left and right just fine). - The attachment to clean corners, that thin tube you see in the picture, is pretty nice. I like that it has a flat shape all throughout, not round with a circular end. HOWEVER, it should be longer!! It's too small! Sure you can reach window corners like in the picture, but you can't reach behind tight areas. You'd have been able to if the tube was just longer or came with an extension. - The vacuum is small and comfortable to hold. - I find that the absorption area at the bottom should be bigger so that I can suck in a larger surface area.

I recently started suffering with allergies for the first time in my life, so I've been vacuuming a lot to try to clean my environment as best I can. I have gone over the carpets twice in one day and each time the cup comes away full of hair, dirt, and unbelievably what must be the former tenants carpet fresh powder.

{"review": "I had an old Panasonic rice cooker which had performed faithfully for almost 20 years, but it didn't have a Teflon pot and tended to scorch rice on the bottom -- especially brown rice. After reading countless reviews of various rice cookers, I decided to chance the Aroma ARC-914SBD. My experience has confirmed some of the tips and observations of previous reviews: ~ To avoid calamities, follow the directions in the user's manual, not what's on the rice package or what you used to do when cooking on the stove top. I was particularly surprised that brown rice takes no more water than white rice, but turns out beautifully. ~ The term \"cup\" does not mean an 8 ounce cup. It's actually 3/4 of a cup (6 ounces). I quickly discovered that trying to convert this idiosyncratic measurement scheme to standard English measurement is more trouble than it's worth. Just do what the directions say. ~ There's good reasons for this cooker's taking longer than stovetop cooking or what my old rice cooker took. It intentionally heats brown rice more slowly and apparently cooks at a lower temperature than with white rice. That's fine with me, since the result is perfectly cooked brown rice! ~ The top assembly is slightly more awkward to clean than a simple removable glass or metal top would be. It's really not much of an issue, but others have noticed it also. ~ The maximum capacity is claimed to be eight cups of cooked rice, which is actually six - 8 ounce cups.

I know this is obvious but be careful not to touch the steam vent while it's on. I'm a curious cat and I touched it and almost instantly burnt myself. :( No worries though, it's far from the handle.

{"review": "I've had several rice cookers in the past, enjoyed them all and this is no exception. My last rice cooker, Zujirushi brand, only lasted 2 years before kicking the bucket, which was kinda odd since the past cookers lasted closer to 5. This is my first time trying the Aroma brand and so far, the experience is pretty nice. Coming from a guy who is use to the simple \"one-click\" function cookers, I thought this was easy to use. I've been using this on a weekly basis for about a month and so far no issues. Rice cooks a little bit longer than I'm accustomed to (about 20 mins for 3 cups of white rice), but the rice comes out great. Haven't use the steamer function yet. I've read some unhappy reviews about the rice being too dry, not cooked or too watery... I've had none of that. If it comes out too watery, you're probably adding too much water. Undercooked, it's probably broken. Too dry, you didn't add enough water. What most people don't understand, rice by different brands/variety will absorb water differently. You have to go judge how much water to put in by the rice you put in. I use Jasmine rice and the water marking on the pot is spot on. For $30-ish, I think this is a good deal. Pros: Cons: (So far) Reliable Cook time (about 20-25 mins) Easy to use Multi-function option", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I have been making rice in a pot the \"regular way\" for so long that I didn't think it was necessary to buy a rice cooker. I have so many gadgets cluttering up my counter I didn't want another. However, I have recently switched to making more Brown Rice and I can never get it to turn out the way I want. After reading the reviews on this rice cooker I decided to give and and try it. SO GLAD I DID!!! It makes cooking rice a million times easier. Just pour in rice and water then push button and walk away--then come back to perfectly done rice! And my brown rice is terrific; plump, nutty, chewy and moist without being soggy. I have also cooked great White Rice, Quinoa and steamed veggies. This small size is perfect for our small family (or just me) and it has earned a place on the counter, even though it doesn't take up that much space.

UPDATE: For anyone else who asks about cooking small amounts, I put in 1/2 cup dry brown rice and it cooked perfect.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Overall we have found this to be a great water filter. But we have had our water tested by a professional, both at the tap, and at the filtered tap on the refrigerator. Both waters tested the same for chlorine content, however, the particle contaminants were greatly reduced by the filter on the refrigerator. Something to note on your water filter. The light is merely a timed indicator of when they want you to replace the filter. Think of it as a \"countdown timer\" that starts as soon as you reset it. It is in no way measuring the amount of water you are consuming... Personally, I used to change out the filter every 6 months when the indicator light came on, but we rarely use the water/ice now, so I haven't changed it (or reset it) in over a year although I probably will soon. I actually cut the first one in half to see how \"contaminated\" the filter was and to my surprise, it looked like a brand new filter... The life of a filter depends on a couple of things. 1. The amount of contaminants in your water (well water is typically the worst) 2. The amount of water that passes through the filter If you have low contaminants and/or use very little filtered water, your filter will last much longer than 6 months. If you pay attention to the amount of water flow and the size of your ice cubes, you can more accurately determine the proper time to replace the filter. I have county water and we also have installed a \"whole house\" water filtration system, so I can probably get closer to 2 years out of a filter. Obviously, not everyone has these installed though, just use common sense on when to replace your filter and you'll be fine. P.S. Why is it more expensive per unit to buy the 3-pack than it is to buy the 2-pack? Am I the only one that found this odd?", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "We purchased a new Whirlpool refrigerator earlier this year. The new refrigerator has all the marvelous improvements developed in the last ten years for refrigerators, including a water filter. The water filter really does deliver better water. However, the water filter seems quite expensive to me. Whirlpool, and other manufacturer's that use this type of filter, recommend the filter be replaced twice a year, whether you need to replace the filter or not. The filter is relatively easy to replace, but be aware of what happens when you pull the filter. To remove the old filter you push a button next to the filter, typically to the left of the filter. Then pull on the cap covering the filter and pull the filter out. Make a note of how the filter was oriented when you pull it out. The filter will now begin dripping water, so have a paper towel or small bowl available to let the water drip into. You can either let the filter finish dripping into a sink, or throw it into a plastic bag that you can seal to keep the water from dripping out of the bag. Be sure you remove the cover from the filter before you toss it. On our Whirlpool the cover twists counterclockwise for removal. Install the filter cover onto the new filter. It takes just a twist to lock it into place. Holding the filter so that the two straight pieces on the end of the filter are vertical, with the open portion of the filter cover oriented on the bottom, slide the new filter straight into the filter cavity until the button on the left clicks to let you know the new filter is locked into place. Note that these instructions are for a Whirlpool, but I believe most other refrigerators are similar. You should be ready to go! Had I known refrigerator water filters were so expensive I might have gone with a refrigerator without one, though our local water has a lot of chlorine in it (which is filtered out by the filter). As with many modern conveniences, this water filter represents a convenience that you did not know you needed until you had it. Now that I have it, I am wondering whether I want it since I have to spend a chunk of change each year in filter replacements. Oh well. I guess I can sleep more soundly knowing that the water filter is now removing a bunch of stuff from my water that my body either did not want or need. Good luck!", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "Since I had had previous experience with Pur water filters, we purchased a side-by-side water and ice dispenser Whirlpool fridge over a year ago that uses these filters and they have made a huge difference in the quality of our water. We live in Riverview, FL, a suburb of Tampa, and the water here is so foul that I sometimes wonder if I have an odor from it after I shower. Since it smelled that bad coming from the tap I knew I was not going to drink it, cook with it, nor give it to my cats. So, to save us the expense of buying bottled water, we bought the fridge. Yes, the filters are expensive, but they are Pur water filters which, in my opinion, are better than Brita. I would rather have the expense than get sick drinking nasty water. Since I use the filtered water for just about everything, I have to replace my filter more frequently, but it is well worth the cost. To save a few bucks, I order my filter online and three at a time; this usually saves me $3-5.00 per filter. Just search for the item number of the filter and you will find several places that sell it either as a single, a three-pack, a four-pack or a six-pack. Obviously, the more you buy, the more you save.", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "I have purchased this refrigerator filter several times before from other sources, and have never had a problem. This time I found Amazon had the best price, so I bought here and even signed up for the subscription service, which gave me a 15% discount and would automatically reorder the item every 6 months. The item arrived, and I waited until my then-current filter needed replacing. At that time I got out the new filter and tried to install it. I have done this with replacement filters before and it's always been quick and easy. This time I removed the old filter, took off the cap and placed it on the new filter, and tried inserting the new filter. The new filter went all the way in but would not catch and stay in, it kept popping back out. I switched back to the old filter and it went in just fine. I tried this repeatedly, as did a friend, and we always got the same result. I tried to request a replacement online at Amazon, but was unable to do so because it was past the 30-day deadline after the purchase. I searched all over the site and found no way to contact an actual person to explain the situation. I contacted Whirlpool directly twice, and both times was told they could do nothing about my defective item because I had ordered through Amazon. Today on a whim I Googled \"contact amazon.com\" and found a phone number. After a lengthy discussion the end result was that Amazon will let me return the item, but will charge me a restocking fee. The kicker is, they won't tell me what the fee is, they expect me to just return the item and then they will refund whatever amount is left after that fee. Despite my pointing out what a ridiculous practice that is, and mentioning that I will both cancel my subscription and post a negative review, that was the best I could get them to do. So now I am posting this review and will cancel my subscription for future filter purchases. I have bought literally hundreds of items online over the past couple decades, and am really surprised that a company claiming to have such great customer service is responding this way. I don't think I've ever posted a negative review before, but I want others to know that if they buy this item direct from Amazon, they need to check it right away even if they won't be using it for a while, or risk getting stuck with a defective item, no refund/replacement, and lots of time wasted.

{"review": "Weird taste to water & ice after installing this filter... Just like another reviewer stated. Purchased this awhile ago to have on hand when the one in the fridge needed replacing. Installed this filter in June 2012 At first we thought it was our well water or something to do with our water softener. So we Re-disinfected the well and the fun task of disinfecting ALL of the water lines. We also cleaned & changed the salt in softener & re-checked the settings. But still a weird strange taste to the filtered water and ice.. making it undrinkable! Finally we we had a 'duh'-moment.. and like another reviewer we checked the water from other faucets.. and the water from other sources in home tasted clean and pure.. like water is supposed to!! As the other reviewer commented.. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THESE FILTERS! I'm purchasing elsewhere in the future. Hope these filters are investigated so we can find what type of substance was causing the weird taste..and find out if it causes any ill effects for those that have consumed the water!! if i could have rated them LESS than one star.. or a scary star I would have.

{"review": "I just assembled and used this vaccuum for the 1st time, lastnight (ie: April 5, 2013). For one thing, I Loved how easy it was to assemble! Basically, stuff just pops into the sockets where they belong. You will only need a philips screwdriver to tighten 2 screws on the handle (which are included). Besides that, I think the cord is a very nice length! Granted, I live in an 880-sq.ft apartment, so there isn't a whole lot of ground to cover, but I only had to unplug it once in order to reach all areas of my apartment. Besides that, my girlfriend & I were amazed to see just how much dirt & stuff this thing picked up!!!!! This vacuum does make a fair amount of noise, but that's because it has a sweet motor which obviously does exactly what a GOOD vaccuum is expected to do! Finally, it was so easy to remove the \"dirt canister\", empty it & put it back in place! Also, it has a dial on the front which adjusts the vacuum's height, and the machine is very easy to manuever. I love it, so far! I will follow up here if this vaccuum malfunctions in time, but for now, I'm highly impressed! ***UPDATE*** Today is May 29, 2013. I've owned this vacuum almost 2 months and have used it once per week to clean my apartment. I have NO complaints so far. It's still going strong, and I really like how the canister is so easy to dump out & replace. I'll be sure to post here again if/when this thing lets me down. ***UPDATE*** Today is December 15, 2013. It's still working great, and I still love it. No complaints! :) ***UPDATE*** Today is June 18, 2014. It's been about 14 months now and I continue to use this vaccuum frequently. NO complaints. It still operates as expected, and Very easy to use. I'm extremely pleased! NOTE: I learned a very important lesson!! I recently began using a powder deodorizer on my carpet (the last 3 times I've cleaned), and I noticed that the vacuum's base area (motor?) was getting unusually warm. Of course I became concerned so I called a local vacuum repair shop just to ask if this sounded typical. The shop worker immediately told me that using any powder product with a vacuum is THE WORSE thing you can do! The powder is so fine, it gets into the vac's motor and will eventually causes it to overheat! Using these kind of powder products, kills vacuums! I immediately discontinued using the deodorizer, and so far, my vacuum seems fine. So, beware.....NO powder deodorizers! :)", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I am a vacuum cleaner guru and 'snob'. I've owned about 20 different 'bagless' models in the past 15 years, and am always happy to review the great ones, in order to 'get the word out'. If you want an excellent, everyday bagless vac without breaking the bank, this is it! This 'CleanView OnePass' model has excellent suction (you can feel the suction) and edge pickup abilities, carpet and hard floor performance, and is not as loud as other vacs. The dirt bin is a good size that holds a lot of dirt, and it is easy to empty and snap back onto the machine. I use 2 main vacs in my house, which are my current favorites. The Bissell and my Shark 'Navigator NV22L'. I've had my Shark almost 2 years now, but the hose that connects into the sweeper base cracked, and I cannot find a replacement, so I used duct tape to seal it as best I can. I was going to purchase yet another Shark, but I don't like the somewhat narrow path compared to the wider Bissell, and i'm afraid the hose will crack again prematurely. It takes me much less time to vacuum with the Bissell. Also, the Bissell has manual height adjustment settings, which is always a good feature. The Bissell also cost half of what the Shark Navigator does. In summation, you cannot do better for about 70 dollars! 4.5 stars. 5/23/13 update: It is now one day after I wrote this review, and I wanted to tell everyone about a simple mod (modification) I did to this vac to make it perform even better! There is always a bit of leakage in vacuum hose assemblies that robs a vac of some of it's suction, so I applied some white 'DAP Alex Plus Easy Caulk' around the hose where the flexible part meets the connectors to completely seal the slight gap that exists. I gave it a day to dry and cure, and I noticed an increase in suction power! What was once an already excellent vac, with excellent suction, is now a MONSTER! I would not be surprised if suction increased on the order of 10 to 20 percent!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I bought this vac for my wife on March 23rd, 2013 and today (about 4 1/2 months later) it goes to the trash can. It worked well until about a month ago when it started going through belts. Today, my wife told me it had been smoking when she used it (I thought it's too young to be smoking). Being an engineer, I took this as a challenge and decided it was time to get to the bottom of it. I ran the vac with the bottom cover removed and observed that the belt migrates over to the end of the motor shaft and begins rubbing on the metal rub plate. I wondered why the belt moves off the center of the motor shaft. A close look revealed that the motor shaft is no longer parallel to the beater brush. I suspected something had slipped out of place inside the motor housing so I unplugged it and took it apart to see if I could fix it. As I was taking it apart I noticed that the plastic housing surrounding the motor shaft was deformed from excessive heating. In fact, after about fifteen minutes of disassembly time, the motor was still too hot to touch. At that point I realized there was no fixing this. They've taken too much cost out of the motor (not enough iron and copper) which makes the motor run too hot which in turn softens the plastic housing causing it to deform. It's a shame, if they had spent about five bucks more on the motor it would have lasted for years.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I bought this vacuum as a secondary machine for light duty in some rooms. Our primary vacuum is a 6-year-old Dyson that is still working like a champ. For what this vacuum is... it's a great deal. I'm not sure if you can find a better machine on the market for 80 bucks or less. Its cyclone is very rudimentary, but it does have decent suction and vacuums almost as well as our Dyson. The attachments are decent for a vacuum that costs less than a hundred bucks and its overall design and build quality is impressive for a machine in its class. Bissell has really stepped up their game with these newer machines. Some nit-picks I have about it: - Although the pre-motor filter is washable and \"doesn't need replacement\" according to Bissell, I would be surprised if it lasts for over a year before needing to be replaced. It is made from cheap single density foam and I've noticed that it traps dirt into the foam fibers even after washing it. Also, given the rudimentary nature of the cyclone, roughly half of the fine particle dust ends up right in the filter, slowing the suction down. So if you live in a dusty home, or have pets, you will be cleaning and washing the filter every single time you empty the canister… which I am resorted to doing. - Bissell chose to use stickers on the vacuum which leave behind glue residue when you remove them. This is a colossal fail in my opinion and lowers the overall quality of the vacuum. - The “One Pass” technology is just marketing drivel, let’s just call it what it is. There is nothing special about the design of the brush bar on this vacuum. - Although not surprising in this price range, and I don’t think Bissell claims that it has it anyway, but this vacuum does not have a sealed HEPA cycle. This means that although it has a HEPA filter, it is possible for fine dust particles and allergens to escape the filter through gaps in the vacuum itself, or in the seal of the HEPA filter. It seems to do an OK job filtering particles, but I can still smell dust when I use it.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "If you are looking for a great vacuum to get the dirty job done quickly and still stay within a budget, then the BISSELL CleanView with One Pass Technology is for you! It is quite comparable to much higher priced Vacuums in the quality of cleaning. It just has a few design flaws that could be altered to make this vacuum more user friendly; Thus the 4 stars. PROS: - Very easy assembly. No Husband required! Had it assembled in less than 15 minutes. That includes pulling it all out of the box. - Bagless! love this feature! No changing of bags - Washable Filters! N0 need to replace a lot of parts weekly/monthly/etc. - All accessories easily dock on the vacuum! No extra storage space required. - This vacuum is much quieter than any other vacuum I've ever used. Not whisper quiet, but a lot more than other vacuums. - Moves very easily across all levels of carpet thickness. I don't feel like I have to put much effort into pushing it across the floor at all. - It is very lightweight and easy to carry up and down flights of stairs - Easy to adjust height level of brush for thicker or thinner carpets - Handles Cat/Pet hair very well! Easily picks up and removes cat hair from the cat bed, carpet floor, and furniture. - The Turbo Brush is well powered and does a very good job cleaning up little spills. - Cleans up more in one pass than any other vacuum I've used. I crumbled a lot of Ritz crackers onto the floor and pushed then into the carpet a bit just to see how well it worked. In one pass over, you couldn't see any crackers left behind! This definitely saves me time cleaning! CONS: - I wish this vacuum had a better cord winding system. I am just silly and hate winding up the cord after every time I vacuum. I'd love a fast auto-winding feature. So I was sad to see this model doesn't have that. - The Hose can actually extend up to 6 feet. Now this could just be because my vacuum is still so new, but it doesn't like to extend well without pulling the entire vacuum unit over. I have to have someone hold the vacuum in place while I pull on the hose to reach the crevices or do the stairs. - The actual vacuum unit tips over far too easily when using the hose. I can see this issue becoming less prevalent as I use the vacuum more and stretch out the hose, but I don't see it going away completely even after a lot of use. - Power switch is not in a user friendly location. The power switch is on the side of the vacuum and you have to bend over to reach, instead of a simple push with the foot with other power foot buttons at the bottom. - The power chord seems a little short. I have to constantly stop, unplug and move the cord to a new outlet so I can keep vacuuming through my house. It's about just 2 feet short of what I would prefer. I can almost do my entire living room and hallway; but I just barely pull short of the end of the hallway, so I have to move the plug to finish off. Overall: Even with the few cons, I am still in love with my BISSELL! And it is still light years ahead of my old vacuum! And really you can't beat the price for the quality of clean you are getting. I couldn't be happier to have a quality vacuum that really cuts down on the time spent vacuuming, so I can spend it on more important things like my kids, reading, cooking dinner, or just taking that 10 minutes to catch some special \"me\" time!

My problem with it is that the belt slips almost off almost immediately after I put it back on. I disassembled the machine and found that there is absolutely nothing holding the belt on to the rod upon which it fits. That could have been solved in the engineering literally for 50 cents.

The brush quit working, and I thought the belt must have broken---strange that would happen so soon, but an easy enough fix. Upon removing the bottom cover, I discovered that the belt was NOT broken, but had slipped off the metal rod from the motor. I put it back on, and went back to vacuuming. Not 30 seconds later, it was off again. So, to vacuum my house, I go through the process of vacuuming for 30 seconds, put the vacuum on a table, remove all 7 screws, put the belt back on, replace all 7 screws, vacuum for 30 seconds, etc. When the belt is on (for 30 seconds at a time) it works quite well.

It has the water and ice dispenser on the left French door just under the snazzy blue led lighted touch control panel. Anyway, the change filter light came on and so I removed the filter (it is really easy, just unscrew it a half turn and it comes right out) so I could see what the replacement part number on it said. It was DA-29-00020A. After looking around the internet, and looking on the Samsung website I found that there is no such part number - the closest thing I found was almost the same number only ending with B instead of A. I called Samsung and after getting bounced to 3 different customer service people who had no idea whether part DA-29-00020A was the correct replacement for part DA-29-00020B and one customer service person who did not know that the filters are supposed to be changed after a while, I found a person who was able to tell me that DA-29-00020B is in fact the correct replacement filter for refrigerator model RF4289HARS. I bought two of these filters - one to install now and one for a spare. I put one in (it takes about 5 seconds to insert it and give it a half twist to the right to install it, and then I followed the instructions of running about a gallon of water through it. You really do need to run this amount of water through it so get all of the air out of it so you get a smooth stream of filered water coming out. I then reset the change filter light - you have to do this manually but all it takes is pressing and holding for 5 seconds (not the 3 seconds they tell you) the child lock/filter reset spot on the bottom left corner of the touch control screen just above the water/ice dispenser.

{"review": "I recently bought this to sharpen all of my kitchen knives which had gone dull over the years. At first, I didn't think it worked too well. But then I went to the Edgeware website and watched their YouTube video on how to use it, and realized that you may have to pull the knife throught the sharpener up to 10 times to get it sharp. (I was initially only pulling it through a couple times.) After pulling through the knives about 5 times, the knives did indeed get very sharp. For my knives, I pulled them through the \"course\" side 5-6 times, then through the \"fine\" side about 4 times. Seemed to work well for me. Another tip I learned by watching Edgeware's YouTube video, was to set the sharpener on the edge of the counter at a 45 degree angle. (That's apparently what the v-shaped groove is for on the bottom of the sharpener.) When the sharpener is on the edge, you can pull the knives straight through and down without worrying about hitting the countertop and scratching it or breaking the tip off your knife. Lastly, I'm not sure why some reviewers say that this only works on small knives. I used it on small knives, as well as all of my larger chef style knives. The process is exactly the same no matter the size of the knife. So it should work the same, and indeed it worked just fine on all of my small and large knives.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "This is a magnificent little sharpener. As a former professional chef, I can honestly say if this product had been available twenty years ago I would have had one. When the blade dulls the work is slower and more likely to result in inferior cuts and accidental cuts. If you follow the instructions you'll have a razor sharp knife in about one minute.

{"review": "I bought this specifically for some inexpensive \"Farberware Pro\" knives, for which it matched the factory bevel very well. I have not tried it with any other knives, but I imagine Farberware's grind is fairly typical of most kitchen knives being sold today. This sharpener is not comparable to a stone or similar systems when faced with varied or more complex grinds, and is not going anywhere near the cleaver, for example. However, the carbide bits are very aggressive, much better than typical \"coarse\" ceramic sharpeners, and could probably regrind a knife fairly quickly. The \"fine\" ceramic rods are standard fare. The grip looked small in the picture but, combined with the traction from the rubber bottom, proved comfortable and completely secure. Of the fixed angle, countertop sharpeners I have encountered, this is the best designed and I expect to replace it with same model when it wears out.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is a fantastic product. It's inexpensive, ergonomically friendly, and sharpens very well. Because it is both small and attractive, I can leave it on the kitchen counter beside my knife block for very quick, easy touch-up sharpening (use the ceramic slot for this purpose).

It never seemed to get them as sharp as I hoped and not to mention it seemed to take a special skill to sharpen the knives without taking too much of the blade and to sharpen at the right angle so as I make things even. I always worried I was doing things wrong or taking too much metal off my knife. This does succeed in making knife sharpening easy. I like that it guides the knife through so there is less guesswork about angles. But I do worry at times that it is still taking too much off my knife and that I might be better off getting them professionally sharpened. This product does get my knives sharper, but it is not a miracle product. My knives, yes, are sharper, but still not close to what they were the day I pulled them out of the package.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "There used to be a model of this fan that was near perfect. It was the HT-800 and I have three of them because I love having them in multiple rooms in the summer. That awesome model seems to have been replaced with this model which is less powerful. The less powerful part is OK, I can just turn the speed up on it (I always used the first setting on the HT-800--that sucker was strong!l). The part they really screwed up, though, is the base. They inexplicably cut away parts of it in the front and the back so now, instead of being solid and sturdy feeling, it's flimsy feeling and top heavy and falls over or points upward every time you touch it. Why oh why do so many companies take a product that's fantastic just the way it is and then change it so it sucks? By the way, I put this same review on the manufacturer's website (Kaz) and noticed that they change all customer reviews to 5 stars, no matter how many you choose. Real honest of them. After years of buying this brand, I guess I'll be looking for a different one the next time I need a new fan.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "Are you in the market for a $16 smallish fan? Then you are probably trying to decide between the Honeywell Chillout and the Honeywell TurboForce. I have both and like both, but both are suited for slightly different settings. In a nutshell, the Chillout pushes less air but has quieter operation (and a more pleasing tone, but that is subjective); and, the Honeywell has more options (tilt, 3 speed settings) and a more stable base (and as you can guess pushes more air with it's larger fan blades and is louder). So in the end you need to decide which fan will work better for you. Air Flow: Winner = Tie - (+1 Honeywell) Based upon my observations the Honeywell low setting produces airflow in between the low and high setting on the Chillout. The medium setting on the Honeywell gives more airflow than the high setting on the Chillout. The high setting on the Honeywell give more airflow than can be achieved by the Chillout. - (+1 Chillout) As a consequence of this, however, the Chillout allows you to have a truly low setting for those instances you just want a touch of airflow. The Honeywell is still pretty powerful at its lowest setting. For us, this comes in handy in our daughter's room. This way our baby monitor (audio only) is not overpowered by the strong gust/sound from the Honeywell. Now my daughter is allowed to use a fan overnight - with the Honeywell, we would shut it off before going to bed. Sound: Winner = Chillout - Chillout: 80 decibels (dB) directly in front of the fan, 70 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 45 dB about three feet to the side of the fan. - Honeywell: 80 dB directly in front of the fan, 75 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 50 dB about three feet to the side of the fan. - As I mentioned above, I fell the tone of the sound from the Chillout is closer to white noise, whereas the Honeywell motor overpowers the sound and is higher pitched. The Honeywell sound is not annoying, just louder and less pleasing (for those that like white noise). Stability: Winner = Honeywell - The Honeywell has a solid base that allows uniform distribution of weight across the entire base. It sits well in window sills with extended platforms in front. - The Chillout has a pair of feet in the front that is connected by a cross bar. The back is a fin similar to the front feet, but pointing backwards. The depth of the Chillout is slightly less than the Honeywell. I thought this might add to stability when used in a window sill or the platform in front of a window if you have one; however, I did not find this to be the case. I found that with the feet design, the Chillout has a more concentrated distribution of weight and therefore has a tendency to slip and fall to the side when used in situations that are not perfectly stable. - Case in point - our windows have platforms that sit in front of the window. They run about four and a half inches wide. The Honeywell sits on these with not problem despite extending about an inch or so beyond the platform. The Chillout, despite being only about a half inch beyond the platform, want to fall forward and off the platform because of the shape and position of the front feet and lack of other contact points. We have to use something underneath the fan to extend the effective platform width to keep the fan in place. This review is re-posted as a Chillout review.", "id": "3737601"}

Also, in chilly weather, the warm air which has risen to the upper levels of your room will be moved around, thanks to this little wonder.

{"review": "I am very impressed with this extra small desk sized fan. It creates a nice strong breeze that can be felt from several feet away. Even the lowest setting creates quite a breeze, so if you have papers around or need an extra quiet fan this is probably not a good choice. For me though, I like the white noise it creates and in the hot, humid Florida summers, this is a nice way to cool off without having astronomical power bills. I purchased one fan for each of the bedrooms and can now raise the temp on my A/C by two degrees and yet it feels cooler than it did before. The fan can also be wall-mounted and the fan's angle clicks into secure settings so you don't have to worry about it rotating up or down. The power cord appears to be around six feet long. I highly recommend these little fans for portability, space, and effectiveness.

Fearing that I may end up getting a used repackaged product (as mentioned in some of the negative reviews) I made sure to pick up a TDS* water meter/tester as well. Not only to make sure I got a new filter from this seller, but also so I can test the various liquids used around my home. As I'd mentioned in my review for the TDS* water meter/tester, my tap water is hard so I used the baseline measurement (PPM's) of a bottle of Poland Spring water. My main concern about this filter or my refrigerator water line in general, was that it wasn't going to make too much of a difference drinking water from the tap versus one that came out of this filter. After my baseline measurements, my concerns were put at ease. Below are results from my tests: (measurements in PPM) 0-50 = Ideal drinking water 50-100 = Carbon filtered water 100-200 = Hard water 200-300 = Marginally acceptable 200-400 = Average tap water 400+ Very high TDS contaminant level --My household baseline-- Bottle of Poland Spring = 18 Tap Water = 281 Gatorade = 260 5 month old filter from my refrigerator water line = 240 New filter from my refrigerator water line = 200 Melted ice (4 hours) = 293 So what did I learn from this... My tap water isn't too bad, this particular filter can probably go another month or two, and I really need to clean my ice maker.

I plan on retesting many times, with a new filter on, under different various conditions, etc. But the preliminary news is that this GE filter barely does anything. The testing does not tell you what the contaminants are... it could be that the filter is removing harmful ones, yet returning charcoal from the filtering process? Or it could be the refrigerator is channeling the water around the filter instead of through it? A lot of thing could be going on... but one thing that wont be going on is me drinking much of the water coming out of the GE filter anymore!

In a small household of two adults, the filter should last considerably longer than two years.

{"review": "Lots of reviews on this site refer to the confusion regarding this replacement filter (UKF8001), so here are my observations on two matters: 1.) Which filter are we getting (750 Gallons vs 200 Gallons, etc) when we buy UKF8001? 2.) How frequently should we change it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gallon Capacity Rating ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Like everyone else, my box lists two different capacities (750 Gallon Rating & 200 Gallon Rating) * Underneath each gallon rating it says the number of contaminents reduced (12 & 17 respectively) * As others have shown in their photos, immediately below that, it lists a number of contaminents, with a checkmark as to whether the filter for that gallon rating filters each of the contaminents. Note that for the 750 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 12 and chlorobenzene is not checked. Note that for the 200 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 17 and cholorbenzene IS checked. Now, here's the key observation. On the front of my box it says in a bright pink callout \"Reduces 12 contaminents...\" Note that it does not say 17 contaminents, but 12. Also it does not mention chlorobenzene. From this I take it that UKF8001 filter that I received is rated 750 gallons, and does not filter chlorobenzene. I assume that if the filter were rated for 200 gallons and filtering chlorobenzene, then the box would be labeled on the front as filtering 17 contaminents, but I cannot prove this. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has a box that has such a designation on the front to see how their box differs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Change at 6 months or 12 months ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Regarding changing the filter at 1 yr vs 6 months, here's what my refrigerator manual said about that: \"The filter monitor system measures the amount of water that passes through the filter and alerts you to replace the filter. When 90% of the filter's rated life is used, the yellow (Order) light comes on. When 100% of the filter's rated life is used, the red (Replace) light comes on, and it is recommended that you replace the filter. For models without filter status lights, replace the filter every 6 months. Use replacement filter model 67003523; order Part Number 4396395.\" From this I take it that some refrigerators are advanced enough to measure the amount of water that has passed through the system and to make recommendations as to when to change the filter. To determine this, you would need to check your fridge manual. If your refrigerator has such a feature, then you can probably go by the fridge's recommendation. Also, I suspect some fridges just go by the date and alert you after 6 months or a year. Or for those fridges that have a usage monitoring system, perhaps they alert you after six months or a year even if you haven't reached your maximum capacity rating. For example, I have an advanced fridge with the capacity monitor. I installed UKF8001 the last two times, and each time the fridge has indicated a need to change the filter at just about 1 yr, even though there is no way we used 750 gallons in that time frame. Probably this is to ensure the filter gets changed regularly whether you have met the usage profile or not. Regarding the fact that the box is stamped at 6 months even though it can be used for a full year and is rated at 750 Gallons, here's my theory. The filter manufacturer says that without a usage monitoring feature, their recommendation is 6 months. Probably the manufacturer stamps 6 months on the outside of the box since that is the shortest and most generic case (and also so they can sell more filters. Lol.) But the frequency you should change the filter will depend on your particular fridge, your usage, and your water quality. Finally, although the filter works just fine, I deducted one point from the rating because the packaging causes so much needless confusion.", "id": "3741181"}

I have always been a fan of Pur water filtration systems, so with this filter you get the great taste of Pur filtered water right out of your refrigerator. It lasts about 1 year and then a red light on the refrigerator comes on indicating that it is time to swap out the water filter. To be honest, the water didn't really taste bad at the year marker, so you might be able to get the filter to last longer than that. Can't say for sure, though, since we have always gone ahead and swapped it out anyways. It is super easy to install. It depends on your refrigerator, but on our Maytag the filter is on the inside of the refrigerator in the top back right corner. You open the filter door by pushing in the tab. Then turn the filter counter-clockwise to unscrew it. The filter will have some remaining water in it, so make sure that you keep it tilted up or you will have some water to wipe up. The new filter comes in shrink wrap plastic, so you take that off and then peal off the seal that covers the top of the filter. Insert the new filter where the old one was and turn clockwise to tighten. Don't over tighten it. Just get it snug. You will hear water rush into the filter as you are screwing it in. Then close the filter door. Last thing is to let some water run through the lines to remove all the air. I took a 1 gallon jug and just let the water fill it up. The instructions recommend running 4 gallons through to make sure you removed all the air. I only did 1 gallon and it seemed to be more than enough. That's it!

The light is merely a timed indicator of when they want you to replace the filter. Think of it as a \"countdown timer\" that starts as soon as you reset it. It is in no way measuring the amount of water you are consuming... Personally, I used to change out the filter every 6 months when the indicator light came on, but we rarely use the water/ice now, so I haven't changed it (or reset it) in over a year although I probably will soon. I actually cut the first one in half to see how \"contaminated\" the filter was and to my surprise, it looked like a brand new filter... The life of a filter depends on a couple of things. 1. The amount of contaminants in your water (well water is typically the worst) 2. The amount of water that passes through the filter If you have low contaminants and/or use very little filtered water, your filter will last much longer than 6 months. If you pay attention to the amount of water flow and the size of your ice cubes, you can more accurately determine the proper time to replace the filter. I have county water and we also have installed a \"whole house\" water filtration system, so I can probably get closer to 2 years out of a filter. Obviously, not everyone has these installed though, just use common sense on when to replace your filter and you'll be fine. P.S. Why is it more expensive per unit to buy the 3-pack than it is to buy the 2-pack? Am I the only one that found this odd?", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "We purchased a new Whirlpool refrigerator earlier this year. The new refrigerator has all the marvelous improvements developed in the last ten years for refrigerators, including a water filter. The water filter really does deliver better water. However, the water filter seems quite expensive to me. Whirlpool, and other manufacturer's that use this type of filter, recommend the filter be replaced twice a year, whether you need to replace the filter or not. The filter is relatively easy to replace, but be aware of what happens when you pull the filter. To remove the old filter you push a button next to the filter, typically to the left of the filter. Then pull on the cap covering the filter and pull the filter out. Make a note of how the filter was oriented when you pull it out. The filter will now begin dripping water, so have a paper towel or small bowl available to let the water drip into. You can either let the filter finish dripping into a sink, or throw it into a plastic bag that you can seal to keep the water from dripping out of the bag. Be sure you remove the cover from the filter before you toss it. On our Whirlpool the cover twists counterclockwise for removal. Install the filter cover onto the new filter. It takes just a twist to lock it into place. Holding the filter so that the two straight pieces on the end of the filter are vertical, with the open portion of the filter cover oriented on the bottom, slide the new filter straight into the filter cavity until the button on the left clicks to let you know the new filter is locked into place. Note that these instructions are for a Whirlpool, but I believe most other refrigerators are similar. You should be ready to go! Had I known refrigerator water filters were so expensive I might have gone with a refrigerator without one, though our local water has a lot of chlorine in it (which is filtered out by the filter). As with many modern conveniences, this water filter represents a convenience that you did not know you needed until you had it. Now that I have it, I am wondering whether I want it since I have to spend a chunk of change each year in filter replacements. Oh well. I guess I can sleep more soundly knowing that the water filter is now removing a bunch of stuff from my water that my body either did not want or need. Good luck!", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "Since I had had previous experience with Pur water filters, we purchased a side-by-side water and ice dispenser Whirlpool fridge over a year ago that uses these filters and they have made a huge difference in the quality of our water. We live in Riverview, FL, a suburb of Tampa, and the water here is so foul that I sometimes wonder if I have an odor from it after I shower. Since it smelled that bad coming from the tap I knew I was not going to drink it, cook with it, nor give it to my cats. So, to save us the expense of buying bottled water, we bought the fridge. Yes, the filters are expensive, but they are Pur water filters which, in my opinion, are better than Brita. I would rather have the expense than get sick drinking nasty water. Since I use the filtered water for just about everything, I have to replace my filter more frequently, but it is well worth the cost. To save a few bucks, I order my filter online and three at a time; this usually saves me $3-5.00 per filter. Just search for the item number of the filter and you will find several places that sell it either as a single, a three-pack, a four-pack or a six-pack. Obviously, the more you buy, the more you save.", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "I have purchased this refrigerator filter several times before from other sources, and have never had a problem. This time I found Amazon had the best price, so I bought here and even signed up for the subscription service, which gave me a 15% discount and would automatically reorder the item every 6 months. The item arrived, and I waited until my then-current filter needed replacing. At that time I got out the new filter and tried to install it. I have done this with replacement filters before and it's always been quick and easy. This time I removed the old filter, took off the cap and placed it on the new filter, and tried inserting the new filter. The new filter went all the way in but would not catch and stay in, it kept popping back out. I switched back to the old filter and it went in just fine. I tried this repeatedly, as did a friend, and we always got the same result. I tried to request a replacement online at Amazon, but was unable to do so because it was past the 30-day deadline after the purchase. I searched all over the site and found no way to contact an actual person to explain the situation. I contacted Whirlpool directly twice, and both times was told they could do nothing about my defective item because I had ordered through Amazon. Today on a whim I Googled \"contact amazon.com\" and found a phone number. After a lengthy discussion the end result was that Amazon will let me return the item, but will charge me a restocking fee. The kicker is, they won't tell me what the fee is, they expect me to just return the item and then they will refund whatever amount is left after that fee. Despite my pointing out what a ridiculous practice that is, and mentioning that I will both cancel my subscription and post a negative review, that was the best I could get them to do. So now I am posting this review and will cancel my subscription for future filter purchases. I have bought literally hundreds of items online over the past couple decades, and am really surprised that a company claiming to have such great customer service is responding this way. I don't think I've ever posted a negative review before, but I want others to know that if they buy this item direct from Amazon, they need to check it right away even if they won't be using it for a while, or risk getting stuck with a defective item, no refund/replacement, and lots of time wasted. Better yet, get your filters elsewhere and/or find a different brand!", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "This filter lasted about 7 months for our family of four. It provides crystal clear and very good tasting drinking water. It's very quick and easy to replace and it can be done in about 30 seconds. The only down side is the cost is a little on the high side and this filter only removes 4 different contaminants. I pay a few more dollars now and get the PUR 4396710 that removes 12 different contaminants including harmful substances like lead, mercury, asbestos.

{"review": "Weird taste to water & ice after installing this filter... Just like another reviewer stated. Purchased this awhile ago to have on hand when the one in the fridge needed replacing. Installed this filter in June 2012 At first we thought it was our well water or something to do with our water softener. So we Re-disinfected the well and the fun task of disinfecting ALL of the water lines. We also cleaned & changed the salt in softener & re-checked the settings. But still a weird strange taste to the filtered water and ice.. making it undrinkable! Finally we we had a 'duh'-moment.. and like another reviewer we checked the water from other faucets.. and the water from other sources in home tasted clean and pure.. like water is supposed to!! As the other reviewer commented.. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THESE FILTERS! I'm purchasing elsewhere in the future. Hope these filters are investigated so we can find what type of substance was causing the weird taste..and find out if it causes any ill effects for those that have consumed the water!! if i could have rated them LESS than one star.. or a scary star I would have. Personally I would also like a REFUND!!!", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "Late last year I bought a fancy Samsung refrigerator - the model RF4289HARS. It is the one with the 4 doors (actually two French doors on top, a middle drawer, and a bottom freezer drawer. It has the water and ice dispenser on the left French door just under the snazzy blue led lighted touch control panel. Anyway, the change filter light came on and so I removed the filter (it is really easy, just unscrew it a half turn and it comes right out) so I could see what the replacement part number on it said. It was DA-29-00020A. After looking around the internet, and looking on the Samsung website I found that there is no such part number - the closest thing I found was almost the same number only ending with B instead of A. I called Samsung and after getting bounced to 3 different customer service people who had no idea whether part DA-29-00020A was the correct replacement for part DA-29-00020B and one customer service person who did not know that the filters are supposed to be changed after a while, I found a person who was able to tell me that DA-29-00020B is in fact the correct replacement filter for refrigerator model RF4289HARS. I bought two of these filters - one to install now and one for a spare. I put one in (it takes about 5 seconds to insert it and give it a half twist to the right to install it, and then I followed the instructions of running about a gallon of water through it. You really do need to run this amount of water through it so get all of the air out of it so you get a smooth stream of filered water coming out. I then reset the change filter light - you have to do this manually but all it takes is pressing and holding for 5 seconds (not the 3 seconds they tell you) the child lock/filter reset spot on the bottom left corner of the touch control screen just above the water/ice dispenser. It works great now - tasty filtered water and flavorless crushed ice from my fancy refrigerator any time I want it.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "I've owned some type of Dustbuster/handvac for the last twenty years and I don't think I've ever ever had one that I didn't hate. Too little suction power, not enough charge time, the suction nozzle is awkward to use, and the batteries are always dead after a couple minutes. I can keep them plugged into the wall all the time, but that kills the battery and wastes electricity. I have found it much more effective to just use the suction hose on my upright, even though that means lugging my vacuum around. So I decided to see what is new in handvac technology and if they have improved at all over the last ten years. Fortunately, I can say that they have. The Black and Decker 14.4v Lithium Ion DustBuster is the same handvac as the Black & Decker CHV1410 Dustbuster 14.4-Volt Cordless Cyclonic Hand Vac except it contains a Lithium-Ion (LIB) battery, whereas the standard CHV1410 contains a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery. If you're trying to decide between the two devices, I would recommend this Lithium-Ion model due to the advantages of the battery: 1. Higher energy density - this means that the LIB battery can hold more energy per volume. In this case the CHV1410L holds about twice the amount of energy as the CHV1410. 2. Greater power density - this refers to bursts of power the battery is capable. It works well when combined with the higher energy density mentioned above. 3. No memory effect - this is something you might have noticed with a Ni-Cd battery. These batteries work best when you fully discharge the battery and then recharge it. With a Dustbuster, you're almost never going to do this. You'll use it for a few minutes then put it back on the mount to charge. This can sometimes product a memory effect, where the cadmium inside the battery forms crystals and the battery will hold less of a charge. A LIB battery does not experience a memory effect. 4. Non-toxic - Ni-Cd batteries are toxic and classified as hazardous. LiB aren't, so disposal is much better for the environment. LiB do have a couple small disadvantages, but in this application and with the frequent recharging the Dustbuster will see, I feel that it is definitely the right choice. Not to mention the toxicity factor alone makes me feel better about using this type of battery. USE AND OPERATION - I evaluated both the CHV1410L and the standard CHV1410 at the same time to see what the real difference was between the devices and how the battery affected them. The main thing I like about the CHV1410L does have to do with the battery. It will supposedly hold a charge for up to 18 months. I can't confirm if this is true, but the first time I had it, I gave it a full charge and then removed it from the power source and let it sit uncharged for 30 days. When I tried it out, it seemed to be completely charged and worked great. With my previous Dustbuster, it would have been dead after two days. I did the same 30 day test with the CHV1410. Although it did still have a powerful charge in it and seemed to work fine, I did notice it was less powerful than the CHV1410L. I tested this by putting two small Styrofoam balls in front of the Dustbusters at a specific distance, and then gradually moved the Dustbusters closer to the peanuts until they sucked them up. In repeated tests, the CHV1410L grabbed the ball slightly before the CHV1410, demonstrating more power. For the remainder of my use and testing, the two units performed the same. The main thing I noticed about using the Dustbuster is how powerful it is. I was not expecting much out of it, but it performed almost as well as my upright. It has a narrow opening on the front of it to concentrate more of the power. That little green piece on the end pulls out and extends the dustbuster so you can get in hard to reach places. This worked great for cobwebs and getting dust from under furniture like sofas and dressers. The crevice tool also has a small brush attached to it. I tried it out on a sofa covered in dog hair, but did not find that the brush helped much at all. It was just as easy to use it without the brush. The only way I see that the brush might be handy is for my ceiling fans, which allows me to press down on the crevice tool without pressing into the blade. Otherwise it's not very useful. CLEANING - The CHV1410L is very easy to clean. It's bagless, and uses a plastic filter. You just press in the tabs and it unlocks and you can shake it out into a trash can. One problem I did have with it is that dog hair seemed to collect in the filter holes and I had to pull these out by hand. But I've used a lot of bagless vacuums like this with these types of filters and I would say this is one of the easier ones to clean. Overall, I'm very happy with the CHV1410L and plan to use it for almost everything I was using my upright for, which will save me a lot of time not having to drag it out of the closet and plug it in. The only real negative I have with it is that it's fairly loud, which I guess is to be expected for something so powerful. UPDATE December 2013 - It's been almost two years and the battery on this Dust Buster is still going strong. I use it maybe twice a week for a total of about 30 minutes.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I have had several hand-held vacuum cleaners and Dustbusters over the years. They all had one glaring problem - the battery. Battery life is not very long on these devices, and that is to be expected, but once the battery is completely depleted (which if it is a NiCad, it should always be depleted), it takes many hours (sometimes an entire day) to recharge. And since you shouldn't recharge the battery unless it is completely depleted, you most often have a device that is never fully charged, and thus will only run for a few minutes at a time. This new Dustbuster eliminates that problem by using a Lithium-Ion battery. Not only does it hold a charge much longer, it recharges VERY quickly. Best of all, you can leave it in the charger all the time, so your Dustbuster is always fully charged and ready to go. And you don't have to wait until the battery is completely depleted either. Besides that great feature, virtually everything else (the extending nozzle, brush attachment, rotating nozzle) work perfectly. PROS: 1.Great battery (long lasting, no memory issue, quick recharge, leave in the charger so you always have a full charge). 2.Powerful suction 3.Very easy to empty and clean the dust bowl and filters - something other vacuums don't do well. The dust bowl is visible due to the clear plastic covering that area. 4.Good accessories - extending nozzle, flip-up brush, rotating nozzle work exactly as they should CONS: None at all. Black&Decker has finally made the perfect hand-held vacuum! Even the price is great - I bought it on sale at Home Depot for $67.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Once I received my \"new\" Lithium Ion Dust Buster, I have to agree with the majority of the reviews. This dust buster was well designed, easy to operate, great suction, easy to clean and most of all, the battery life is fantastic. I've had Nicad dust busters in the past and they just don't last very long and our most recent one the charger burned out. Right now, the only negative (and this has been pointed out by other reviewers) is the bright blue LED charging light. This light is flashing while in charge mode and steady when fully charged. It's best to keep this charger in a room where you won't see it if you're trying to sleep, eat or watch TV - a bit obnoxious. This light is too bright. A non-LED light would have made more sense. We can deal with the light issue so this product gets a full 5 stars. I would also recommend that Amazon make available the filter that goes with this hand vac. the one's shown do not fit this unit. From what I've seen so far, you can only get another filter through Black & Decker and there is no filter part number in the manual.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I've owned and used several older generation Dustbuters. This one is a totally new design. Since I was tired of weak vacuums with weak batteries, I splurged and went for the top-of-the-line model. Here are my key findings: 1. Suction is good for a battery powered vacuum; certainly better than older models. 2. The charging light is very bright. I hadn't anticipated getting a new nightlight, but that's what it is. 3. The front end of the vacuum often pops off in use. I make sure the two latches on the sides are engaged, but when you press the nozzle into something, like carpet, to suck up dirt, sometimes the nozzle just pops off and then the dirt dumps out! 4. The extendable nozzle is a joke. You pull it out and snap it in place and the moment it contacts something, it pushes right back in. Useless feature. 5. Battery life for a cleaning job seems fine. I've never yet had the vacuum lose power or even slow down. I only use it for tasks that run it a few minutes at a time, but that was the outer limit for the older units. All in all, a mixed bag. Fundamentally good suction and battery life, but quirky \"features.\"", "id": "510106"}

When you really need it to suck hard for a while, it poops out just when you need it not to! The new design is easy enough to use and the battery is GREAT!

{"review": "--Just a quick update to my original review below: We've owned the dust buster for about a year now. We use it pretty much daily, mainly for cleaning up after the cats, and it continues to perform flawlessly. I definitely recommend this item highly.-- We purchased this dust buster a month ago for spot vacuuming cat fur, cleaning up kitty litter around the cat box, and general household use. We've been very pleased with all aspects of this product and highly recommended it. A few quick notes after reading other reviews. A number of people complain about how bright the recharging light is on on the handle of the vacuum. We have ours in the kitchen so that's not an issue for us, but if that bothers you, just put a piece of tape over the light. Masking tape or electrical tape will definitely solve the problem for a total cost of less than a penny. At least one person said that the crevice tool doesn't stay extended and needs a locking mechanism. Initially I thought the same thing, but you just need to pull the tool harder when extending it. It'll click it place and lock just fine.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I NEVER write reviews, but thought that it might be a good idea to start, since lately I have been using so many reviews to help make my household purchases. I looked at several different '\"dust busters\" and read tons of reviews before purchasing this one. I've had it about a month now and I absolutely love it! It holds a charge for a very long time, is powerful enough to suction up all the messes my kids make, and I like that I can just empty it and not worry about buying replacement anything. I have 2 toddlers and they are quite possibly the messiest kids on the planet. I use my dust buster a million times a day for little messes and about 3 times a day for a good once over of the high traffic areas of the house. It picks up whole pieces of cereal with no problem. Trix and Cocoa Puffs don't even get stuck in the nozzle area. It even managed to suck up a Dum Dum the other day! We visit my parents each Sunday and the kids were always making messes with snacks all over their house, so now we just grab the dust buster on our way out the door and take it with us. It keeps its charge while we're there all day and makes cleaning up after them so much easier. Some reviews I read complained about the noise level, but it doesn't bother me. I guess if you were gonna vacuum the crumbs out of your bed while your husband/wife slept, it wouldn't be ideal, but I seriously don't have a problem with the noise. It's a vacuum, one wouldn't expect it to be quiet. Another complaint was about the charging light on it being so bright. It is very bright, but my base is plugged in just inside my kitchen pantry, so it's not an issue for me. I wouldn't recommend putting it in a bedroom or anything, as it is rather bright and flashes while recharging. To me, neither the noise or charge light present even the slightest problem. I'm very glad I decided to go with this dust buster, it has definitely made keeping my house clean (with 2 messy toddlers) much, much easier!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I was surprised when it came charged and ready to use and is much more aesthetically pleasing than the photo depicts (off white and pearl lime).

Like many others, I bought this model for the lithium battery. Although some do not like the counter recharging base, I like it since it is mobile and I can easily recharge in whatever area indoors or outdoors. The only downside is it is noisy just like any vacuum cleaner. Another B&D benefit is the 2 year warranty when all other handheld vacs I've bought were only one year.

As soon as it arrived on my door step, I opened it up and put it on the charger. Within a half hour it indicated it was fully charged and I put it to work and boy was I impressed. I ran it for about 8 minutes straight and it never even showed any signs of slowing down. The suction is alot stronger than my previous handvac and it picks up alot of dirt. The brush and the extension are permanently attached, which makes it very handy.

{"review": "I spent quite a bit of time researching A/C before purchasing. We live in Oregon and it doesn't get too hot but there's a month or two in the summer where the heat and humidity get oppressive in the house. I wanted an inexpensive, small, window A/C to increase the comfort. I wanted something small enough that I can store it the other 10 months. So, after much research I ordered this model. I was going to get the 6K BTU model with the electronic controls but I figured I would get something super cheap and if it didn't work I could use it as a single room cooler. Shipped free which makes this a pretty good deal. Arrived in about a week. Installation was easy, following the instructions in the manual. I did have to install and remove the A/C about 3 times to get all the sealing right. In the box there's a lot of different thicknesses of foam and foam tape. There is no specific instructions about what to do with this, except the stuff for the top gap of the upper sash. So, I experimented with various combos to get a good seal. We have recent vinyl windows with screens but no storms so the unit basically dropped right in. However, there are some gaps around the bottom in this configuration. I stuffed these with the thickest foam that came with the unit. This did the trick but didn't look too great. Luckly I ordered extra foam tape as another reviewer recommended, and I used small pieces of that to caulk around it inside and outside, leaving the big foam inside. It actually looks pretty neat and professional. $4 well spent ;) Anyway, the unit is installed in our main living room. We are in a 1940's box bungalow so this room is about half of the width and length of the house. The bedrooms and kitchen connect to it. With it on HI cool/Max(7) the entire house has been very cold and huge amounts of water have been pulled out. We will see how it performs in the upcoming week of 95+ temps. We keep a few $10 box fans around to circulate air so I can move the cold air around. One thing is that I have heard mentioned on a few other models is that the fan catches water in the pan and spits it around. This is a feature and not a bug ;). The unit is designed to pitch backward slightly when properly mounted. Moisture removed from the room collects at the bottom. The fan blade is coated in rubber and it's designed to suck water up and spray it on the evaporator coils. This facilitates some precooling of the outside air. It drastically increases efficiency. I would not drill drain holes, as other people have mentioned. Summary: $100, and my house is cold AND quiet. You can't say much more. If it's not enough for the hottest day I might get one more and move them to the bedrooms. It's very quiet on low but I like white noise.. I hope it lasts, even if it doesn't I'd gladly pay another $100 in 2 years.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I got it hoping it would keep my apartment cool-ER. I expected it to keep it comfortable, not cold. I also had a bit of a problem with size. The only window that opens in my house is a vertical sliding window, which Air Conditioners I can afford, aren't made for. Once I received it, I started to assemble and install. Originally I was going to leave the extensions off, since my window was only 18 inches wide, but after I got it and thought about it more, I realized they could still help keep it supported. So I put them on. They are about an inch inside the window, to help it from falling out. Also, I originally hoped to buy some wood and put that above it, but once I saw how sturdy it was with just the extensions, I put cardboard above it and plastic taped around the edges with duct tape. Very red neck, I know. It's sealed with the help of some other bits that came with it to help seal it. I installed it a little over 12 hours ago and my home is cold. I live in a house above a garage. Just a large living room, average bathroom and small bedroom. It's 621 SQ Feet.(assuming I did the math correctly. 23 x 27 feet.) This is total, but there are 3 separate rooms here. (Also, I have a low ceiling, only 6.5 Feet.) I placed it in my only opening window in the living room and it keeps the bathroom cold which is closest, and my bedroom pretty cold too, which is farthest. A lot larger than advertised for. I didn't care, I needed a little cooler than I had. Before, it was hotter inside than it was outside. I have it on high, but will consider turning it down, which I never thought I would do. I like the cold. It's THAT cold. For $110, I got an amazing air conditioner that perform WAY better than expected/advertised and it got here exceptionally fast too. It arrived 4 days after I ordered it with standard shipping and handling. I am a very happy costumer.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I have run this all summer, purchasing it about five months ago. It has been a relatively mild summer with only 12 days over 100 degrees. Pros - Easy to Install Excellent Size for Small Windows Fairly Quite to run (would not bother me if I slept in my office) Keeps my office 11x14 frigidly cold when set on max (temp 7 of 7) ..(takes about 8 hours to cool down a hot room with the door closed) ..(I keep it on 5 out of 7 on the temp gauge, that even gets a little cold at times) Cons - The Directional Air Flow vents are poor Not much difference between the High Cold/Fan settings and Low Cool/Fan settings When rain blows against the unit the accordion extensions collect a little water along the bottom I am considering getting two or three more for my house next summer. I had one of my Frigidaire window units at the house die this year, it was twelve years old. **UPDATE** September 22, 2011 One year later to the date. No this was not planned. This little unit lasted through another summer, and this one was not so mild. I lost count of the days over 100 degrees. I did not buy any more for my house, as I moved into a new home with central air. This unit does however continue to cool my office as it was purchased for. It was stored all winter in the utility closet off my office (i.e. indoors, warm, and dry). It was washed down with a power washer before being re-installed in the window this year. Pros - Excellent Size for Small Windows (I am still amazed I found a unit that fit) Fairly Quite to run (I don't notice it running anymore, and no customers have complained) It can still freeze me and my customers out when set on max temp (7) ..(I timed it again and it still takes about 8 hours to cool down a 11x14 hot room) Cons - The Directional Airflow vents are very poor (they are basically useless) Still not much difference between the High and Low settings ..(I fixed the rain issue above by using plexiglass this year) Rust has started to form on the outside grill and corners where the condensation drops For those of you wondering, the reduced star is because of the directional airflow issues. Another review mentioned the styrofoam can be seen, and was probably used to fill the gaps. This is true but after two years it still seems to be in good shape. It also appears to be fairly thick. Some other items I tested this year... Room size 11x14 (left on this setting for 24 hours before temperature was measured) Average outside temperature during this week of tests was 98 degrees. Setting Cool/High 7 brought the room to 58 degrees, outside temperature 98 Setting Cool/High 5 brought the room to 63 degrees, outside temperature 96 Setting Cool/High 3 brought the room to 74 degrees, outside temperature 100 Setting Cool/High 1 brought the room to 89 degrees, outside temperature 99 All temperatures were read at 4pm. **Please note this was my unit's performance. Yours may differ. Yesterday it was put back in storage until next year. I considered getting a sound level meter or loudness level meter to measure the actual noise my unit puts out, but I have not got around to that yet. Maybe next year.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "Installation was fairly easy.. For anyone reading who has storm windows that doesn't know what they're getting into.. You need to build a small platform on the window sill (and secure it) using plywood or any decent wood. I had to build mine up about 2 1/2 inches to get the manufacturer's recommended slant towards outside.. so it drains properly per the manual. As far as operation, I can keep my 13x15 2nd floor bedroom in Minnesota at a cool 72-73F in MN (June) using the highest setting on High Cool. For a 5000BTU unit, this is impressively considering we have 2 human bodies and 2 dogs.. Heat sources, sleeping at night. I'm protective of my windows, so I cut up some painter's plastic (planning to get some plexiglass) .. and stapled it to the exposed areas of where the A/C unit is sticking out. Recommend buying some extra foam to anyone with storm windows who don't want to remove them. This unit is not an absolute brute like some 10K+ BTU window units I have lifted. The window attachment is WAY more than enough to hold it in. I do recommend predrilling the holes with a 1/8\" drill bit prior to screwing in to prevent your windows' wood from splitting. Performance of the unit for its size - I would give it an 9/10. Remember this IS a 5000BTU, not a 8K+. The unit will refuse to cool below 70F from what I can tell. It will kick the compressor off when it feels its hit its designated temp. Appearance out of the box - 7/10 - I also had bent fins on the rear of the unit. Looks tacky, but whatever. It's an AC unit. Nobody cares. I would've loved a digital readout of the current temp on the unit, but oh well. Overall - 9/10. Appearance is not everything. People only care if it works and looks decent. UPDATE 6/24 -- Unit is still operating well. I now run it on Low Cool. High Cool is overkill. It will attempt to get the room to about 70F. I keep it on 7 and it keeps my master bedroom at 73F.. Perfect for me and girlfriend. I noticed it was rattling a bit more than I liked.. Found out my mounting screw into the window was a bit loose. I got a bigger screw and screwed it in way tighter. No more rattling. I spent 2 hrs measuring and cutting a piece of plexiglass to put around the unit outside. Screwed it into the window.. Doesn't look too tacky and leaves very little room for water to get in. Frigidaire knows how to make A/C units in my opinion. This unit is saving me A LOT of money. I can keep off my central A/C for my 2200 sq. ft 2 story house with a walk-out basement. We sit in the basement during the evening (which is always cool), and crank on the Frigidaire 20mins before bedtime. I will be buying Frigidaire for all A/C / Dehumidifier needs my whole life. UPDATE 8/14 -- So I started having to work from home a few days a week, and I hate cranking on the big central A/C to cool our 2000+ sq. ft. house. So I caved in and bought another one of these.. I think I had it out of the box and on the window in about a half hour. The new one makes some odd noises pin-like, but it hasn't seemed to affect any functionality. I think it's just part of the air conditioning process. I am glad to own 2 identical A/C units now that operate at probably half the electricity that an 8K or 10K window unit would use. The bedroom I put it in is about 120 sq ft but has a small 25 sq ft. attached bathroom. Both were brought from 80-82F to 74F in about an hour. Not bad. I just can't get over how light these are. One guy was picking up 2 8K window units from Sears.. the box said net weight 71Lbs! I think these units are barely 30, if that. If you have storm windows like me, as I stated above.. Be sure to make yourself a 2-3\" platform on the sill (and screw it down) to prevent any rattling. I just love the fact that I don't have to get on a ladder and install a bracket to put these in. UPDATE 8/8/12 -- Still running strong. They seem to be a little noisy sometimes, but if you enjoy the white noise at night -- you'll be fine. I actually am only running 1 currently.. Not working from home anymore. UPDATE 10/14/13 -- Survived its second season.. Both units still running strong. I literally removed it from the window in TWO minutes this year.. Getting way better at it!", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "Frigidaire's warranty is a lie. They won't service a defective unit. The manual says the product has a one year parts and labor Warranty and a five year compressor warranty. Mine went bad after 10 days. It took 5 phone calls and three hours on the phone with Frigidaire to be told that they do not service Air Conditioner units of 5000 BTU or less. Their ONLY solution is to return the item to Amazon or to where ever it was purchased. I relied upon their Frigidaire's written warranty and disposed of the box, thinking that if anything went wrong they'd come out and fix it. Fortunately Amazon will send a replacement unit and I'll use that box to return the defective one. However that solution won't work if the unit goes bad after six months. Then you'll be stuck with a company that won't honor its' written warranty. Don't Buy This Frigidaire Air Conditioner.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I live in a basement apartment and struggled to find an AC for my tiny windows - the opening is only 16.5 inches wide and 18 inches tall. No window air conditioner would fit that space. I had an 8,000 BTU portable A/C but that thing was just very inefficient - drawing in hot air from the outside as most portable units do because they constantly exhaust hot air and new air has to come from somewhere. Long story short, I stumbled upon this little unit and found out it was only 16 inches wide (sans the side panels). It fit my tiny window perfectly. Most importantly, it also does not protrude very far to the outside, and important consideration when people walk past your window. Mounting this unit was easy. It is so light that you don't have to struggle with it like most air conditioners. You should not get a hernia lugging this unit. It also puts very little strain on the window frame and does not need any additional brackets. To my surprise, the unit also came with tons of mounting hardware - including insulation often not included with other units. There was even a piece of foam to put in between the two window panes to insulate the gap in between two open windows. Nice. I noticed a lot of people out here mount the unit in an angled position. You do not have to go out of your way to do that. If you mount it right, it angles slightly to the outside by itself. The reason for this is so that the water that accumulates in the unit flows outside and not inside. You don't have to tilt the unit outward as much as many of the pictures on here show. What the unit lacks in size it does not lack in output. At 5,000 BTU, I was not expecting much, but this unit outperformed the 8,000 BTU portable unit easily, drawing 1/3 less electricity. It cools the entire 400sqft apartment with the help of a fan. (a well-insulated apartment, don't expect it to cool 450sqft in a poorly insulated or sun-exposed building) It is one of the quieter units out there, producing a constant hum rather than sounding like a freight train like some units. The most noise comes from the fan. The compressor is barely noticeable. It is a no frills unit with manual controls - but they work pretty well. It maintains the room temperature better than many electronic units. Set to level 6, it cools the room to a comfortable 73 degrees, level 7 cools to about 69 degrees. it cycles on and off nicely and quietly. Finally, the build quality seems rather good - nothing rattles or vibrates. Overall, this is probably the best little AC out there you can get. If space is a problem and you were considering a wasteful portable unit, give this little guy a try.", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "If you're like me, when you've been out shopping, say Walmart, Sears, or some of the other places you might have noticed, especially in the hot summer time, these smaller cheaper A/C window units on store shelves. For the most part, they've looked cheap and I've never seriously considered buying one as my standards are a bit higher. However, here we are, summer 2010, NE Kansas and the temps are rough, especially in my back room. I had to do something. This is where this little gem fits it. Spending a bit of time doing some research on getting the right Window A/C unit for my room at a price point I could afford, brought me here. In short, I have to more than agree to everyone's positive review on this item. This thing screams quality. The boxing / packaging is great. The fit and finish of the unit is perfect. Some very skilled design and workmanship went into this A/C. You could honestly not ask or expect any better. People are saying this thing cools down 2 or 3 rooms with ease. My application will just be one med size bedroom. So far, I have it set to low cool on 3 or 4 and the room is night and day different in terms of comfort. I paid $126 for this unit off eBay. I was saddened to find it for $100 shipped elsewhere which, they have in stock. Do a google search for \"Conn's Frigidaire FRA052XT7\" and the product will pop right up for you. It's $89 there with $10 dollars 3 - 5 day shipping. For the money, the weight of the unit, the fit and finish, name brand, etc. This is about the best investment I've made in sometime. Hats off to the folks at Frigidaire. I mean really, I just cannot put this fantastic product / experience into the words they deserve. I wish I had Bill Gates money, the first thing I would do would be to order 500,000 of these units, sit up a Midwest distribution center with offices and coordinate with local and national cities that account for some of the highest heat related deaths and get these cherished older generations who we owe everything to, these people with out means who are dieing of heat and get them this A/C.

{"review": "I returned a NewAir evaporative cooling tower for this window unit instead. The evaporative coolers just don't work well in Florida and I needed immediate relief for my small 9x12 office this summer. I was against a window unit for aesthetic reasons but didn't see any alternative. This Frigidaire is a great unit for the price so I figured it was worth a shot, and the shipping was free (which is amazing because this thing is not light weight). But I have to say, I am a little disappointed by a couple of things: first, it has a pretty weak fan...you can't feel the air blowing out of this thing if you are more than 4+ feet away, and the air louvers do almost nothing to help direct the air; second, it is pretty noisy in my opinion...I sit about 5 feet away from it and I have to turn the unit off if I'm taking a conference call or put anybody on speaker phone; third, there is no way to attach the screws if you have metal windows, like we do in Florida, so the ONLY thing holding my unit in the window is the sash that's resting on the top of the unit, and that's it. I don't even know how you'd drill into a metal window anyway, probably mess it up. So just be warned about that, probably goes for any AC unit though. Moving on...for my small 9x12 office (108 sq.ft.) I expected it would keep it cooler than it does, but then again this is Florida, and my office is surrounded by windows, so it just barely keeps up. The next unit up is 6,000-BTU and costs an extra $75, an almost 70% increase in price for an extra 1,000 BTU so I don't think it's worth it. Might be worth jumping to 8,000-BTU model, though, for almost an extra $100, but it doesn't even come with a remote. You could buy two 5,000-BTU units for about the same price as the 8,000-BTU unit, but then it would be even more noisy. Ultimately, the 5k unit is fine but just barely cuts the mustard when it comes to cooling in my situation and I wish it was Energy Star rated, so that's why I'm rating it just \"ok\" with 3 stars. All 3 stars are because of price; it would be 5 star if it was a little stronger, quieter, had the Energy Star label and if it came with attachments for a metal window.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I spent so long reading all the reviews - came away thinking that it was the perfect selection. What it is - is a very expensive fan at best.

The area that I need it to cool is 10X9 ft with 8 Ft ceilings in Oregon. So I am not talking a huge room in unbearable heat. It certainly does not cool a room, perhaps a small closet. Not Amazon's fault I am sure they would have let me return it if I got to them in a reasonable time. Unfortunately, I bought it 5 months before the heat hit.", "id": "3737671"}

In an effort to keep cool throughout the night and avoid using the car engine/battery, I looked into getting a battery powered fan with a clip so I could mount it on the visor in the car. This one seemed to fit the bill out of the few I found. Pros: - The 2 D cell batteries will last pretty long even with consistent use. I work anywhere from 9.5 to 13 hour shifts on average and have owned this now for 2+ weeks with no signs of low battery power yet. (Note that I do alternate between the high and low settings depending on my needs which helps conserve the power.) - The fan has 2 speeds, low and high. Low = someone gently blowing on you. High = feels like someone fanning you with a folder at a decent pace, not sure how else to explain haha. Even with the fan a couple feet away you still get a nice solid breeze that helps keep you comfortable. - Strong spring in the clip means the clip holds very well even when hanging and the rubber feet give it added grip. - The plastic feels durable and seems like it will last a while. - The fan head itself has a decent range of motion so you can position it to your liking and the ring around the head's base where it pivots can be tightened or loosened so that the fan doesn't move around during operation and will stay in place. - There is a power adapter slot on the back of the fan behind the switch for a 3 Volt DC, 500ma adapter. The instructions state you can purchase a compatible one through their website. I'm sure if needed you can also get one from RadioShack or a similar electronics store. - Quiet operation, which in my case is good as it doesn't drown out my surroundings. Cons: - Don't expect this fan to have the torque of a USB powered fan or outlet powered fan. While it does give a good solid breeze, it lacks the power of it's bigger brothers as it is using a small 3 volt motor. I haven't been able to test this with the 3 volt adapter as I don't own one, though I suspect it will not increase the fan's performance. - Contrary to what's listed here on Amazon, it appears that the battery pack is no longer detachable from the clip's base, and there is no length of cable from the fan to the battery pack as a result. Two small wires can be seen running along the interior side of the pivot point from the battery pack to the fan. I don't have an issue with this, so it's not exactly a true \"Con\" for me, but if you were hoping the battery pack could be removed to make the clip a bit slimmer, it looks like that is no longer possible. Overall: - This fan is a great purchase if you need it to keep you cool and comfortable while sitting in your car or sitting at a desk. I can also see it being used while working out on a treadmill or exercise bike, on a baby stroller, etc. as others have stated. If you are expecting to have the wind in your hair, this may not be for you, but for $20 this fan does as it's intended and provides a nice cooling breeze and the clip allows it to be placed in a location of your preference (the ability to clip the fan to the items available may vary of course haha).

{"review": "We used these fans to clip onto our stroller for heat of the summer in disney world. Some older reviews showed a cord and a battery pack that most found annoying, I was expecting this and thought I could put the battery pack in the bottom of the stroller and it would be fine. But when I got it, it has changed in design and there is no longer a cord and removable battery pack. So it does make it harder to clip onto something since the battery pack is so heavy. But I ended up using zip ties and that helped it to stay upright onto the stroller and not fall over from the weight of the batteries. The batteries did last the entire week long trip to disney world so that was a plus. The fan is strong for a battery powered fan and my child cannot get his fingers in the guard. i had previously bought a stroller fan that had foam blade and he ripped the foam blades in a few hours, so this was a much better option.", "id": "3737601"}

Cover has handles on the sides to make it even easier to slip on and off. The only thing missing: a bag to put it in when summer comes around. The beige color is inoffensive and blends in with my house color, though some might wish for a choice of colors. BTW, one corner has a slit/flap.

The unit works superbly from what I can tell. You won't be disappointed in my opinion. Update: 2/17/13: It has been about a year since I purchased it and we have had several inches of snow and very cold weather.

{"review": "The X6675 Lennox 20x25x5 Filter works great. Originally I was going to install an electronic filter with our new HVAC (heat pump w/ AC) system. The salesman and installers suggested that this filter worked nearly as good and was more economical in both the short and long run. Additionally, they said that electronic systems tended to degrade over time whereas this fabric based filter maintained its \"as new\" efficiency if cared for and replaced as needed. While it is recommended to replace it at 6-month intervals, this really depends on each home's air quality. I used a shop vac to clean it after the first 6-months and used it another 6-months before replacing it. It works great and has helped reduce dust in our home a lot. With an electronic fan system, I keep the fan running at a low speed, when not heating or cooling, 24-7.

Sometimes we'll use a little floor fan to pull air into the living room, but overall it keeps the temp around 70-73 degrees; perfect for us. Could probably run cooler, but we havent tried it yet. Increase in electrical bill is negligible...maybe 10-15/mo? I could see it costing 20-25/mo if you set the thermostat lower. Anyway. Very reliable, does a good job, easy to use /install.

Many reviews talk about the \"noise factor\" of this particular unit. I think it hums quietly and after one night sleeping in the same room (I auto-turned off after 2 hours as an experiment) I found it to be way less noisier than a regular window unit. I highly recommend this product. In fact, when I was getting into the elevator to take it up to my apartment, a woman exiting saw the box and said, \"Oh! We just bought this same kind, I love it.\" That was enough right there.!", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "We bought this AC from Costco when they had a sale this summer. We are using it in our cabin to keep the bedrooms cool/comfortable. It's a small house (@ 600 sf each floor) so we can actually keep the entire second floor \"comfortable\" with all bedroom doors open when it's in the 90's & humid outside. We have it in a central location. It doesn’t make the whole upstairs icebox cold but it does a good job of cooling so everyone can sleep. When we are there alone, we keep it in our bedroom & it does get that room very cool. It is easy to set up if you have double hung windows. It took us about 15 minutes to unpack & get it going. **One VERY important note: If your unit has spent ANY time on its side, wait a minimum of 8 hours before plugging it in. If you don't, you will most likely kill your AC. If you are ordering online, I would just assume it has spent some time on its side to be safe. It is kind of noisy; a bit more than a large floor fan but it doesn't keep us awake. Trying to sleep in a hot/humid room is worse. We have had no leaking problems but keep the unit on top of a plastic boot tray just in case. Since this is a weekend house, we take it out of the window when we leave . It's so easy to set up that it is no problem to set it up when we need it. It has wheels, so can be moved to other rooms easily. It is VERY heavy, so keep that in mind if you plan to use it on different floors; carrying up and down stairs is not really fun.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "OMG This thing is the bomb! I live in a beach community in southern California and it's a rare thing to need an a/c. Usually we hav maybe a little over a week of hot weather in the summer, just long enough for me to start stopping for a portable a/c. Then poof the weather turns cool and I empty my Amazon cart without buying. But this year OMG crazy hot weather for going on 2 months - uncharacteristically HIGH humidity. I thought my cat was going to melt having to stay in the house with the windows shut while I was at work all day. So the other evening I went online and purchased this baby - was the best selling unit at the time. Got it for a song, way less than I see now (went up over $150 over night). So it arrived in one day. I came home from work, yanked it out of the box and set it up in the den. Easy to install in the small sliding window. I didn't even use any of the foam as it fits pretty well. I ordered a third party window adapter kit for a full slider window so I can move this in the evening to my bedroom - but it hasn't arrived yet (hopefully tomorrow!). To make this long story shorter I'll get to the point. My house has half insulated ceiling and half open beam ceiling - about 900 sq ft or so. The den where it is operating is COLD and the open beam ceiling living room is nice and cool. This thing is a workhorse. Not sure if it will ultimately reach the bedroom but I'm ok with that as it stays much cooler in that insulated room. Regarding the noise factor, in the battle between noise and cold, cold wins. Plus I don't believe that it is any noisier than a big old fan running on high. As far as portability, I have ceramic tile floors and it's very easy to scoot it around. One last comment on folks that think they can cool down a 1800 sq foot home to 68 degrees when it's 100 degrees outside, no - that's not going to happen. But in my 900 sq ft home, it's doing a darn good job at cooling 3 plus rooms down. Bottom line, I'm ready for the September heat wave here in California. Bring it on!", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I'm sorry - I don't like this product and here's why: 1. It doesn't cool properly. Perhaps I have a bad unit but the compressor runs about 60% of the time just dropping the temperature of a 76 degF room to 74 degF. The room size is only 12' x 12' x 8' so the unit should cool better. In fact, the manual actually says the unit has limited cooling capacity - and can maybe drop the temperature of a room by 5 degF compared to non-cooled conditions. 2. It's really lout- incredibly loud. Especially when the compressor is running. I had given up on the unit at this point and was going to just give it away. So I opened it up and found that the cooling system seems to be very professionally designed (so why is the cooling capacity so poor - maybe it needs to be charged?). The unit is loud because the shell is made up of gigantic thin plastic panels that act as a soundboard. So I sprung $100 for PC noise abatement foam pads and installed them on the inside of the unit. Much less noise, but still very little cooling. 3. It's huge and it's heavy. It is mounted on rollers so it's easy to move around. But for the cooling capacity ... the 'bigness and heaviness' doesn't seem consistent. Overall, I can't see why DeLonghi just didn't purchase a cooling system from someone with experience, such as Trane, or Carrier, or someone who has engineers that are able to design a portable A/C with a reasonable coefficient of performance (COP) will still maintaining a reasonable ambient noise level.

They had me unplug the unit, wait 50 seconds and replug it in. This did nothing so they told me to ship it back to them and I would need to pay for shipping. I told them that this would cost a lot and that they should pay for shipping. They refused. Amazon has wonderful customer service. They paid for me to ship back the unit and sent out a new one (although it's quite a hassle reboxing everything and waiting for UPS). The second unit came just in time for a heat wave.

With all the negative reviews (about 20%) I almost didn't purchase this machine. But I'm glad I did, because it works really well for what it is: a mid size/capacity humidifier. First of all: ***this humidifier has a 2.3 gallon per day maximum output, with a .9 gallon tank.*** Amazon's initial title for this (and many other humidifiers) mentions daily output capacity rather than tank size... this may be confusing, although the correct specs are prominently listed on the Amazon page - fifth bullet point in the \"product features\" section. As for Crane (the manufacturer), their package clearly states a 2.3 gallon daily output, and .9 gallon tank size... The reviewers complaining about the \"misleading name\" should try emailing Amazon suggesting a title change on their website... instead of writing a 1 or 2 star review of the product. That would be more helpful and more fair. As for the product itself: A few buyers obviously received defective machines; this has to be expected on some level with any manufacturer. But having read over the negative reviews, I realized that most of the complaints were due to improper use of the machine. It is essential to read the instruction manual and use the machine as intended by design. Doing so will avoid the pitfalls described by most of these 1-2 star review writers. For reference, I have addressed their most common complaints below: 1) White dust buildup in the room: use filtered or distilled water. This is important if you have hard tap water. (85% of American homes do.) I run my tap water through a Brita filter; the exchange ion resin lowers the concentration of calcium carbonates, accordingly softening tap water. It also helps keep the humidifier cleaner by removing organic impurities, and I have had no white dust buildup. ***If your water is particularly high in mineral content, you should use distilled water, or else opt for a vaporizer-type (humidifying) machine, which creates water vapor free of white dust.*** 2) Limited effectiveness: you are trying to humidify too large a room. In my 500 square foot living room level the machine helps a little; in my 150 square foot bedroom the machine is more than adequate. 3) Height of machine: the manual directs you to put the humidifier *at least* a few feet off the ground; there's no reason you can't place it even higher up if you wish. Doing so will disperse the mist more effectively. 4) Machine runs out of water: try turning it down to about 2/3 power instead of full power. The machine is practically noiseless at this setting and the water tank if actually filled to the rim will last at least 8-10 hours. 5) Machine makes bubbling noise on high: see #4 above. 6) Wet area forms immediately around humidifier: you have the machine turned up too high for the conditions in your room. This is explained in the instruction manual: you need to make sure the mist isn't falling down onto the surfaces around the machine; otherwise moisture will accumulate on those surfaces. Turn the power dial down until the vapor stream is fully evaporating in the air. 7) Machine leaks: Take care that the water tank fits snugly into place, with no gaps. Also, make sure you have the clear rubber ring that fits inside the tank cap. During my initial setup, this little (1 1/2\" diameter) ring came loose and rolled away, and I almost didn't notice. The ring ensures a tight seal on your water tank cap; without it, I'm pretty sure the machine would leak. 8) Machine gets moldy: you are not following the correct cleaning routine, as described in the manual. You need to empty and rinse out the tank daily, and empty the bottom part of the unit too. Once a week you should use a white vinegar/warm water mixture in the tank and bottom of unit (see manual). I hope this was helpful. If my humidifier breaks down I will certainly update this review.", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "The good stuff: 1. QUIET! I can't hear it over my computer fans and my computer is not very loud at all. You can definitely sleep with this thing on no prob. 2. Pretty easy to set up. The instructions tell you that you should rinse it out a bit before you use it. 3. Not too big. It's 13-14 inches at the top where the mist comes out. 9 inches wide/deep. Remember it's round. 4. Reasonably priced for what you get. Some of the humidifiers may very well be better than this, but they also cost $200 or more. For the modest price this is wonderful. 5. It doesn't look too 'medical'. A lot of the other ones have that hypochondriac/invalid look to them. This teardrop shape is kinda cool, but not childish. The not so good stuff: 1. You will need to clean it once a week. They tell you to use white vinegar or bleach. NOT soaps or detergents. So anyway, you will be sloshing in the sink/tub at least once a week. 2. The add the convenient little note: 'It is recommended you use distilled or filtered water'. A lot of tap water is 'hard' and there are minerals and things in it. So it will eventually clog up the nebulizer inside this and it won't work right. There will also be a lot of white dust that will result from the minerals as well. 3. Because of #2 I got the optional filter to use. They say to use the filter for 30-40 refills - and you refill it every day. Filter life is approximately 1 month. And it was $12. 4. YOU CANNOT ADD MEDICINES TO THIS THING. MEDICINES ARE FOR VAPORIZERS not humidifiers. 5. The title of this should be changed to ONE GALLON humidifier. The output is 2.3 gallons since it's a mist/vapor. This is definitely misleading to put 2.3 in the title. I did my homework and I knew it was only 1 gallon, but still it's not cool to have that there to make people think this is bigger than it is. 6. THIS IS FOR A SMALL ROOM. Bedroom or office size. Don't get this if you think it will do the living room or kitchen or some bigger room in the house. 7. You have to be careful that you adjust the moisture right. If it is too high then it will get on things and make them wet. If there is wooden furniture around it could ruin their finish. I have mine sitting on a big plastic cutting board. 8. It needs to be on a level surface. You can't sit it on a towel or carpet. There is a vent on the bottom and that would block it. 9. Keep kids and pets away from it. If you have curious kids or critters there could be potential messy disasters in your future. Even though I listed more in the not so good column I think this is a great buy. I just wanted to list the stuff to consider and that isn't mentioned/listed here in the description - or in the promo video. My big concern was noise. We have a Holmes humidifier which is really big and works great, but it's like being next to an airplane. Not even close to reasonable for sleeping. With the dryness of the winter I asked my Doc about sinus stuff. She said that a humidifier is essential and some saline nasal spray. So I needed one that could run while I was sleeping. This one is ideal for me. Just remember to consider the stuff you need to do to MAINTAIN a humidifier. Some of the reviews here were complaining about white dust and that things got too wet - both of these things are clearly explained in the instructions. If you want one that will be sitting there and you don't have to do anything then this ain't it. But for one of the super duper ones you will need to drop some serious dough. If you don't maintain the humidifier it will not last.", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "This humidifier DOES work in that it does create a nice full water vapor stream - HOWEVER, thats as far as it goes functionally. Let me explain: 1. Starting with the fact that the handle on the tank actually says: \"Do NOT use handle when tank is full\" - yes, I kid you not, this is what it says ON the handle itself - why put in a handle that you cant use? As a result you have to carry the tank with both hands. 2. It has a light that cannot be turned off, so good luck sleeping w this thing in your bedroom. 3. It has to be refilled CONSTANTLY - I did it morning and night. 4. The tank will NOT stand up due to the awkward shape when off the unit, so to fill it, you have to stand there holding it under the faucet. 5. The way its designed, the tank drips every time you take it out to refill - a real pain. 6. But here is by far the worst aspect - Cleaning it is a NIGHTMARE - The base is full of little nooks and crannies that you have to get to w a Q-tip - its full of odd angles, grooves, etc. so good luck trying to get the gunk that accumulates off every couple of days. 7. It has NO antibacterial prevention WHATSOEVER, no filter, no uv light, no silver ion exchange, nothing. If theres something in the water or if something starts breeding in all the crevices youll just breath it right in. 8. The TANK ITSELF is impossible to clean due to the small opening but widening interior - and the central tube where the water vapor comes out...good luck cleaning that, you have to work a cloth or paper towel or whatever by pushing and pulling it through up and down the tube. I actually bought it here at Amazon and went by the very reviews you probably read and, seeing it has mostly positive ones, I decided to buy it. Am I the only one that sees this humidifier as the worst possible design? How on EARTH is it getting so many good reviews? But dont take MY word for it, go to a store before ordering it here so you can see it with your own eyes first hand - dont judge it by the \"cool look\"; actually get it out of the box, pull up the water reservoir and see whos telling the honest truth here. DONT BUY! Real pain!", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "Please note: there are TWO versions of this product that might be sent to you from Amazon. I'm not talking about the different colors, I'm talking about actual functioning differences. The version with the solid white handle on the tank is a superior product. The version with the three cut-outs in the handle (see photos I uploaded) is definitely sub-par. One unit is very quiet (virtually silent but for the slight hum of the ultra-sonic vaporizer) and works well with the hard water filter that is available here on Amazon. (this unit gets four stars) The other unit is quite loud (keeps me awake at night with all the bubbling and gurgling) and will absolutely NOT work with the filter (the tank's fill-cap is too large). (this unit gets only two or three stars) You'll notice that this unit lacks the black ring around the area where the water is vaporized. I'm not sure if this has to do with the noise generated, but the lack of the black ring at least lets you know you got the loud one. The quiet version of the humidifier is great. I love the visible mist, and the unit puts out a good amount of moisture. I do wish the tank was bigger. We have ours set to around 75% here in super-dry Colorado, and I have to fill the tank at least once a day. I am thinking about getting one of these for my studio, but I will likely hack some sort of fix so that the tank can be filled automatically from a faucet (so I don't have to refill the tank manually all the time). [UPDATE] I was quickly shipped a free replacement fill cap when I called and told them the spring in mine was rusty and contaminating the water. The cap was identical to the first (with a better/less rusty spring), but they've changed the filter that goes into humidifier, so now the *new* cap works with the filter. The build quality and volume level of the older unit is still clearly superior, but I would now recommend this product (the new version) even though it gurgles and bubbles all night. It's also more than a little annoying that you can't really wipe out the inside of the fill tank (the hole is way to small), so you can only rinse it out. I'm not sure how sanitary this is. I did buy the drop-in tank cleaner to help with this, but it's going to cost five bucks a month for the cleaner, and ten bucks a month for the filter. That's a pretty high operating cost. [UPDATE - Nov. 2012] The base of the first unit I purchased (the \"good\" one) is now making a *really* loud noise on an intermittent basis. It's like the motor in the base is grinding or struggling to function. It's quite loud, and was an extremely rude awakening at 3am the first time it happened. The only way to make it stop is to give the base a good \"whack\" on the side or to pick the base up a couple of inches and drop it down on the table. Otherwise, the noise persists and no vapor is created. I can only assume this means that something in the motor mechanism is sticking and preventing the humidifier from functioning. [UPDATE - Jan. 2014] After several years of using these units, I am going back to paper filter evaporative humidifiers. They are cheaper to operate (filters and energy consumption), don't produce white dust, generally have a larger water reservoir, and are easier to clean. I used to be able to get the Protec disinfectant balls and Crane Drop Shape Humidifier Demineralization Filter (HS-3161) with Amazon subscription, but neither are available via that program any more, and this means I'm spending around $15 every month or two for upkeep on the Crane Humidifier. Paper filters (for evaporative humidifiers) are cheaper, the humidifiers consume less energy, and there is no white dust. Even using filtered water and the Drop Shape Humidifier Demineralization Filter, we still get white dust, and our water is NOT that hard. I just don't trust that my two year old is breathing safe air (or at least the safest possible) with these units. And while some reviewers have said you can clean them easy enough, just swishing around bleach in the enclosed tank isn't enough for me. I want to be able to scrub the surface clean, and with these tanks, that is simply not possible. [UPDATE - April 2014] While I did remove these from my child's room, I've been trying to keep them going in our bedroom and my office (they were fifty bucks a piece, after all). It has been QUITE an effort though. The loud, intermittent noise of the motor is extremely infuriating. I would say the max life of these units before they start giving you real problems is about a year (I assume the same length as the warranty). While you can take the base apart and fiddle around with the fan that makes the noise; the respite from the noise usually lasts only a few days (or even just a few hours). I took mine apart, blew out the dust, lubricated the fan, and within a couple hours it was making noise again. And to be clear, it's not a tolerable noise. It is VERY loud, and the only way to stop it is to whack the base until it stops. It has something to do with the way the fan sits in the housing. Another reviewer noted that if you loosen the screws that hold the fan housing to the base, it will stop the noise, but for me, it was only a temporary/intermittent solution. While it is now easier to stop the sound by whacking the base (I have to do this fewer times than I used to to stop the noise), the noise was not eliminated by loosening the screws. The older unit I have (the first one I bought) utilizes a fan that just \"sits\" in place (there are no screws that fasten it to the base), so there is no fixing that one other than the whack method to jostle the fan around. FURTHERMORE, the newer unit's vaporizer stopped working. The fan still spins (and makes the terrible sound), but no water is vaporized; thus, the unit is completely useless except to make loud annoying sounds. I would definitely NOT recommend these units. I am now using Essick Air 821-000 Digital Control Evaporative Console Humidifier. It's big and ugly, but it's very quiet, has a humidistat, doesn't produce any white powder, is MUCH easier to clean and maintain, is cheaper and more energy efficient to operate, and has a HUGE reservoir that is very easy to fill and doesn't need to be filled as often. I just wish it came in black or dark gray.", "id": "3737671"}

The fan still spins (and makes the terrible sound), but no water is vaporized; thus, the unit is completely useless except to make loud annoying sounds. I would definitely NOT recommend these units. I am now using Essick Air 821-000 Digital Control Evaporative Console Humidifier. It's big and ugly, but it's very quiet, has a humidistat, doesn't produce any white powder, is MUCH easier to clean and maintain, is cheaper and more energy efficient to operate, and has a HUGE reservoir that is very easy to fill and doesn't need to be filled as often. I just wish it came in black or dark gray.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I gave this product 4 stars. Here are the pros and cons Pros: I am saving about $90 a year, because I don't have to buy filters anymore. Plus this product is cheaper then the last humidifer we had. It does a great job. It is very easy to clean, and fill up. We love the mist it makes. Cons: It makes alot of noise when you turn the indicator all the way up. The higher the setting the more noise it makes. The noise is drops of water falling. It sounds like a faucet, is dripping. It can get annoying. But I have found out that if you just keep the dial in the middle, it keeps the room from drying up, and the dripping noise it not even noticable. The other con about this is. In the discription it said there was a light. I thought that it would kind of act as a nightlight. The light is so small it doesn't provide any light. All in all, the product is well worth the money. It does what it is supposed to do, without having to buy filters.", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "I bought this humidifier and received it in the mail a week ago. I needed one for my room to keep my cello and violin from drying out. I was super excited to put it together, the instructions were easy and direct and I had it up and running in no time at all! First impression: It's cute! It was smaller than I expected - it fits perfectly on top of my dresser! The instructions say to keep it elevated and NOT on carpet. So some might keep that in mind while purchasing one. When I turned on the mist at full blast I was blown away! I kept it at max for a few days when I realized that there was definitely no need for maximum misting in my room (let's just say, my room was heavily humidified!). Since then I've been keeping it between low and medium and it works most wonderfully! I had to refill the tank after about 32 hours of it on medium/low. About, maybe 18 hours on full blast.. I can't remember. Either way, it's not an inconvenience to me to have to fill it up every other day or so. I love this thing and I'm glad I bought it! On cleaning: After using it a while I noticed some mineral deposits on the inside that were really difficult to clean. The instructions tell you to fill it with water and vinegar and shake vigorously. That didn't work. After trying baking soda and ice cubes (it worked alright), I cut up little strips of cloth (an old t-shirt rag) and put it in with water and ice cubes. Trial and error proved that cloths and water worked wonders, most of the deposits were done away with except for the little tiny corners, and even THEY were looking good! To clean the base I used ammonia/water solution and q-tips to get the little nooks and crannies. My humidifier is sparkling clean and I couldn't be more happy with it! (especially now that I know how to clean it well enough!) I have NO regrets about purchasing this humidifier. UPDATE on cleaning: After the last update my humidifier base had since gotten very dirty, (to the point that q-tips wouldn't work) I was dismayed. So, I filled it partly with warm water and bleach and let it sit on the base for a good while. It worked like a dream and looked almost new! I did give it a thorough wipe-down to get rid of any remnants of bleach and I was comforted in knowing it was fully sanitized, having used said bleach. Happy misting!", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "I noticed all the bad reviews on evaporative coolers but having lived in a dry climate most of my life (Colorado), I can tell you this is a high quality EC and any decent EC will work fine if you follow a couple of rules. Please understand these are coming from people in non-humid climates or people who are in dry climates and don't understand how these work differently than ACs. TIP 1: Leave two windows cracked open for cross ventilation - This would be stupid if we were talking about AC's but if a EC is left running in a closed up house or room, it will make the room humid and not cool it down. You want to have dry (outdoor) air come in through the EC so it cools down the air and blows it through the room. When it cools the air down, it makes a little more humid than it was before so you also want a cross draft so the warm air and any humidity has a place to escape. I put my EC about a foot in front of a cracked window so it gets a fresh supply of dry air and I leave another window cracked open on the other side of the room so warm and humid air will escape. If it gets very hot outside I sometimes close the cracked windows until it gets a little too humid for my liking then open them again - this method works well for me but your milage may vary. TIP 2: Use ice water in the water reservoir - Putting ice and or cooling packs in the reservoir along with water will help keep the water cold which in turn make the EC work more efficiently. TIP 3: Clean your EC out occasionally - ECs will accumulate dust and dirt from the air so it if the air it's blowing out smells dusty or is causing allergies it probably just needs a good rinse. Fortunately this unit is very easy to clean. LIMITATION 1: Won't work if it's humid. Get an AC if you live in a humid climate. LIMITATION 2: Won't cool down 105ºF air down to 65ºF - No EC will do this or at least not in a reasonable amount of time. If you follow my tips though, you can get 105 degrees down to 78. ECs are cheaper, more efficient and better for the environment than AC's but definitely have their limitations. If evaporative coolers are right for you, this a is a good buy.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "This is a great machine, I have recommended it to everyone I know. Here are some facts so you can see if it's right for you: 1) It cools the air. Enough so that if you point it at yourself you will get goosebumps. You can also use it as fan. It moves more air than a typical household fan. 2) It is only meant to cool 250 square feet which means it works wonders in our bedroom but in our living room it can cool down our sofa area but not the whole room. 3) It's louder than a fan but it's quieter than an idling truck. 4) Ridiculously easy to use, fill, and clean. 5) When you turn on the cooling element it will make a slight crinkling sound as water is sucked into the filter. That's normal. It also will decrease the fan speed if you have it on 3 (high) for a few minutes to get the cooling going and then will turn back to 3 (high) once it's cooled. Don't fiddle with it. 6) It has a timer that you can set in 30 minute intervals. The timer counts down in 30 minute intervals as well, which is a slight flaw in my opinion. 7) It doesn't oscillate. I'm not sure if any swamp coolers oscillate but it would have been so great if it did because it's too cold to have pointed directly at the bed continuously. 8) Lastly it works great in Colorado because of the arid environment (We're also somewhat high in elevation). It won't work as well in semi-arid or Mediterranean environments such as California (West of the Sierras).", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "*****NOTE: If you live in a humid climate, this will not work. It's not made for that. Evaporative coolers are useful for high altitude and/or dry climates only.***** I live in New Mexico and this year it's unbearably hot out there. I live in a town house that already has a swamp cooler, but management seems to think that this tiny cooler blowing through one vent on the second floor is enough to cool the entire house. WRONG! The air isn't even cool anymore by the time it reaches the first floor. It's awful. A cooler that size can only do so much when it's over 100 degrees. So I decided to shop for a portable one for downstairs and found this one. It sounded like a great deal for the price. I got it in and it is WONDERFUL!!! It's almost too cold in here, I'm in love!! It was easy to set up. Just fill and plug it in and you're good to go. I LOVE that it has a remote and that it's small and aesthetically pleasing. It's also very quiet and gets cool right away. I like the wheels on the bottom too, it's great that I can roll it to the kitchen for when I'm cooking. I didn't cook a thing for the first part of the summer because the stove just makes it impossible in this heat. The ice packs are REALLY helpful for the crazy hot days too, great idea!! I highly recommend this cooler, especially to all of you New Mexicans out there. It's MORE than worth it, I'm VERY happy with it!!!!!!", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "This item does exactly what I wanted it to do!! Be realistic when purchasing though, this item will not cool most or even half of your house or apartment. Practical use is in a single or large room. I use this to cool the loft and hallway upstairs and I roll it into my bedroom at night. We have a large swamp cooler downstairs that cools 1600ft so all I needed was a little added umpth for upstairs. This pumps nothing but cold air and there are several things I have noticed in the three weeks I have used this but first I'll tell you a few things about this product that are not listed in the product description. It has a gallon and half tank that needs to be refilled. Water level is clearly marked on the bottom front when the water tank is mounted in the back. It will beep at you when the tank is almost empty, just before it shuts down the water pump but the fan will continue to go, only the water pump shuts off. Word of advice, let this bad boy sit for about five minutes before you pull out the tank and fill it back up. While your filling it up, water is still dripping (trying to drip back into the tank) but if you have the tank removed it pours it all over the inside bottom portion of the cooler and it all ends up on the floor. I thought my cooler was leaking at first but I realized that a little patience was needed prior to removing the tank for a refill. This product comes with two ice packs!! Put these packs in the freezer and then plop them on the left side of the water tank (water pump descends on the right side of the tank when you slide the tank back into the unit). The ice packs work great to create even cooler air, I sometimes just fill up the left side with ice and water to increase the cool temperature. The remote included is very nice but never really found a use for it, I just turn it on and let it go. Dry hot areas work best. Currently in Colorado and it is hot and dry during the summer. This portable evaporation cooler has three fan speeds and a \"swing\" option. You can set the fan speeds to High, Medium or Low but if you set it to High, it will drop to medium for three minutes once you press the Humid/Cooler button. This starts the water flowing through the back and gives the unit time to circulate enough water through the back. Have no worries, after the three minutes, the fan kicks back up to high and pumps cold air. The \"swing\" option is great, gives an almost natural breeze effect. The fan is located in the back/middle near the cardboard pad that the water runs down. The air is vented from the top where the fan appears to be. That front part that appears to be a fan houses the \"swing\" option and LED display. The circular fan front begins to rotate and circulates cold air. This is a wonderful feature to help spread the cool air, you can turn it off and just jet the cold air in one direction. LED's are located in the direct middle of the circular fan face. Overall, very pleased and impressed. Please do not expect this to cool your house or apartment. Very well constructed with lots of options. This was the most pleasing to the eyes portable evaporation cooler I found and researched for weeks. Most portable swamp coolers look like they are from the 70's but this one looks great. Solid construction, wheels that roll, swivel and lock. I can actually feel the cool breeze of this unit on my back as I type this review. I am uber pleased with this and I recommend this to anyone who just wants to cool the temperature in their living room or bedroom. **Update**1 Year Later** So this thing just decided one day to leak and spew gallons of water on my floor. Called customer service and they told me it shouldn't be leaking. I almost punched myself in the face after that was said! No other advice could be given. I tried to clean everything with Kaboom, even went as far as using a hot glue gun to seal EVERYTHING!! Both inside and out. After many failed attempts to repair this I chunked it in the garabage. Got one summer out of it and that was it, no more warranty and worthless tech support. If you buy this I recommend putting something under it to catch the water. Makes a great fan though, pretty powerful but I don't recommend this to anyone. Loved it at first, it was perfect but a swamp cooler that leaks is about as useful as a secretary with no fingers.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I have 2 other portable evaporative coolers (different brands); but this is the best one. What makes this one stand out is (1) Its height - 37.5\" tall combined with the oscillating fan that really circulates the cool air. So far, the #1 Speed setting is more than sufficient. (2) The removable water tank; makes refilling and cleaning easy. Although, it only holds 1.5 gallons of water; it beeps when it's time to refill. (3) The 2 large ice packs that came with the unit. I put them in the freezer; but haven't needed them yet. (4) A remote control with its own storage slot on the back of the unit. (5) The attractive appearance; I have it in one of the bedrooms, and it looks very nice. Compact too.

{"review": "Although it's smaller than I thought it would be, it's the best thing I've bought in a long time. Plenty of air, but not too loud. (Quieter than the box fan I had been using, but more air movement) The water reservoir lasts about 6-8 hours on high, and I stay plenty cool at night while I'm trying to sleep. It DOES, in fact, oscillate. Use the \"Swing\" feature and the outside vent spins to create \"a vortex of cool air\", but the head inside must be oscillating as well. You can tell when you're in front of it. Yes, you must live in a dry climate, which I do. Just south of Lubbock, Texas. It's been over 100 degrees here this week. My bedroom is around 70 with the Luma running. This room has a large bay window which doesn't open. I usually keep the door closed. Even so, it doesn't get too humid while I'm sleeping. I'm not a real fan of the \"Mode\" feature, which I had had on a previous fan. I don't want it changing speeds while I'm using it. That's just annoying! :) Haven't used the \"Timer\" mode either. When the cooler runs out of water in the reservoir, it automatically shuts off the cooler part and the fan keeps running. Awesome! The whole thing is light, has great wheels on the bottom to move it if you like and the reservoir is easy to get out and refill. I love it and am considering buying more for other parts of the house! Update: August 19, 2014 Here we are, over a year later, and I still LOVE this fan!! I saw one review that said the fan speed light on the front was too dim. Actually, it starts out bright, then dims, which is perfect when you're trying to sleep! I clean the reservoir with vinegar every couple of months and I put a capful of bleach in the water every night, to keep the \"bugs\" away. (I don't want ickies blowing across me!) Not too loud, great air movement and excellent cooling. I'm (still) glad I ponied up the money for this fan!", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "My home office has several computers, printers and photocopiers that make it the hottest room in the house, raising the temperature by almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit. I needed a solution for cooling just this one room. We live in Las Vegas, a very dry climate. The humidity in my office is normally about 15%. My office is about 250 square feet. After filing the Luma EC110S with water and turning it on, it took about half an hour to raise the humidity in the room to 30% and decrease the temperature by 7 degrees. The fan is very powerful. By directing the fan at my back, I immediately felt very comfortable. Temperature and humidity were measured with a portable thermometer/hygrometer. If you live in a dry climate or the desert, this evaporative cooler should work well. If you live in a humid climate, it will not work well. So if your weather forecaster often uses terms like \"muggy\" and \"humid\", do not buy any evaporative cooler.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "The positive reviews for this unit persuaded me to give it a try and I'm sorry to say that was a bad decision. My home office is about 140 square feet and tends to get a little too warm in the afternoons due to its southwesterly exposure to the sun. We have central air conditioning in the house but this one room takes a beating and typically rises a few degrees above the rest of the house. I would just turn down the A/C thermostat but that makes the rest of the house too cold. I figured I would try to solve this by having a separate cooler in my office. The unit itself looks fairly well built and has a nice remote. It's certainly not silent when running but the noise is not bad, and would be very tolerable if it did the job it claims to do. When I first set it up, I filled the tank with room temp water and no ice or ice packs. My office was at 77*F and 29% humidity when I turned the cooler on. 2 hours later my office was at 77*F and >50% humidity. All that accomplished was to make the room less comfortable. This was late in the evening too when the sun was down. I put this absence of cooling down to the fact that I was using room temp water in the tank so I figured I'd give it a try again the following day. This time I used iced water AND the now-frozen ice packs that came with the unit. The results were absolutely identical. I couldn't believe this so at one point I set up my indoor thermostat directly in front of the fan. It was sitting literally 2 feet away and directly in the airflow. The reading? You guessed it - 77*F. (Well, OK - it occasionally flashed to 75*F but always very briefly and then immediately returned to 77*F). These tests were performed with my office's A/C vent shut off to prevent the main system from over-riding whatever the swamp cooler was doing. I also tried it with the main A/C vent open, hoping that would help but no joy - this \"cooler\" still had no impact whatsoever other than make the room more humid. Obviously I returned the unit but had to pay more than $30 in return shipping costs! Since when is it considered acceptable to charge a customer to return a defective product? I don't know why the other reviewers have been so positive about this fan. The only explanation I can think of is that they are running it pointed directly at themselves and therefore are experiencing a perhaps SLIGHTLY enhanced wind-chill effect. I know this much for certain - even in a very dry climate like Arizona, this \"cooler\" does absolutely zip for your room temp. Try something else and be careful to read the return policy for whoever you buy it from. Air & Water Inc. should be avoided.", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "I have this in a window in a small bedroom next to our master bedroom on the second floor, which sits at a right angle to our master bedroom door. I use a floor fan at the small bedroom door to blow the cold air coming out into our 300sqft master bedroom and 150sqft master bath, and the foyer as well. Since cold air is heavier, the cold air at the top of the foyer falls and swirls into all the downstairs rooms that open off of the foyer. I figure I'm getting about 1500sqft of cooling in our 3500sqft house with this little unit. The other three bedrooms and second full bath upstairs are closed since it's just the two of us now. Just use the six out of seven coldness setting and the low fan speed for this. Third year I've used this setup and the air conditioner still works perfectly and quietly. So bottom line, it's an excellent air conditioner that's easy to install, cools well without being maxed out on the cooling or fan speed, and is inexpensive. For a small space it's perfect, and will cool even bigger spaces with a little ingenuity. This is the same unit as model Frigidaire FRA052XT7 5,000-BTU Mini Window Air Conditioner, which at this time is $119 versus $139 for this model. Quick edit to mention another hint about getting the most out of this little unit. If you leave your windows open at night to let the cooler night air in, and fire this up before the rooms start heating up the next morning, it works even better. Make sure you close all those windows when you get up.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I would not have given such a bad review if it were not for the HORRIBLE customer service of Frigidaire. We bought two of these units and one was defective. This is not the reason for the bad review. I understand that sometimes things don't work out of the box and I am fine with that. What I am not fine with is after over two weeks of phone calls to Frigidaire I still don't have a new ac unit and they still don't have a time frame on when it will/might be replaced. It is really hot and this is unacceptable. On the other hand, I decided to call Amazon about this and see if they could do anything. The service rep on the phone was extremely helpful and had a replacement unit sent out right away. Thanks Amazon!!", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "Our bedroom is really fairly small, something like 12x12. We have a large closet but the door to that is kept closed and this air conditioner wouldn't cool the room enough. We have an older air conditioner about the same power we have been using in the bedroom and it can make the room cold if we want it that way and this one won't, it barely makes it comfortable. This air conditioner is very quiet though so it wouldn't be disturbing to use during the night.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "This really nice compact AC is probably the best I have owned in the way of small units...I have one room downstairs where I work that needs AC in the summer, and a 5000 BTU system has always handled the job nicely. I have owned a variety of brands over the years. None of them really being bad or conking out too soon, but there were other small issues that would make them a pain I remember. Like being too big for their BTU, some freezing up or gurgling more than others, and especially rattling. I work from home as an editor and the rattling of many an AC unit has driven me mad in the past. So far, this is the quietest unit I have ever owned. At least when it comes to to rattling anyway. It makes a little rumbling noise when it first gets going, but after that it is very quiet. And, this unit is super compact. You should have no problem fitting it into even an undersized bedroom window. It comes with the usual side panels they all do and installs very easily. As for its features, its as simple as it gets. A high/low, fan only switch, and a thermostat. Much easier and simpler than having a remote in my opinion, and its not missed. And though its true that it doesn't have the energy savor option, I don't really miss that or consider it a liability. I've owned units with that feature in the past and neither liked it at all, nor felt it saved me any amount of money, (if any), that made its cons worthwhile. The power savor only serves to shut the fan off when the compressor shuts down, and its the compressor that burns all the energy anyway. In fact some people feel they do more harm then good for they shut the fan down immediately when the compressor stops, and when the coils inside are still cold, and there is still some cool air in the unit to be distributed. Also, adjusting yourself to the constant on and off of the unit, (that I also believe burns out the compressor that much sooner) doesn't sit well with many people. (Myself included.) All in all this looks and performs like a very solidly built quality unit that does an excellent job of cooling any room within its reach, and I highly recommend it.. Excellent.. : )", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "I don't know if they've somehow improved the technology of these things or if I'm just getting easier to please as I get older (seems unlikely...) but this thing beats the heck out of the model I used back when I was in college! It's much more quiet than I remember these units being and it's actually keeping the entire room cool. It's also not so heavy/unmanageable; I was able to get it set up in the window with minimal difficulty. Great product! (Apparently it uses less energy, too, but I can't speak to that issue because I've not yet received my next electric bill. I hope it's true, though...)", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "This is a pretty small A/C, and although it's not meant for larger square footage, it does a very respectable job of maintaining a comfy temperature in the 700sf main room of our 1200 sf shop. Although summers can be very hot here in Western Montana (we have been having a lot of days in the 90's), the nights cool down nicely, so it's pretty comfortable indoors until early afternoon. If we turn it on about noon and leave it on for the rest of our workday, it stays nice and cool. This unit has a high/low fan without A/C, so we use that in the mornings when the air is still cool outside. Then we switch it over to the A/C around lunchtime. So we only end up running it about 5 hours a day. For climates that have hotter evenings, you may want to stick with the square footage recommendations that come with the unit. As far as installation goes, we had to improvise a bit. The instructions come with options for both wood and vinyl windows. Our shop windows are vinyl, but the inside wood framing was a little different than the diagram. So really, neither option worked perfectly. But with such a small unit, it was really simple to maneuver it a couple of different ways until we found a good solid way to install it while still keeping the proper angle for drainage of the condensation. We ended up with bigger spaces on the bottom of the side fan things, and the insulating foam they provided wasn't enough. But we had some foam that worked even better, so we used that and the unit is nice and tight. This unit has been up and running for a couple of weeks now, and so far so good. If any issues arise, I will update my review.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "This small but mighty air conditioner is all we need to cool our bedroom and saves in electricity usage because we no longer have to cool the entire second floor. We have a 3,200+ square foot home with 2 heating/cooling zones - one for the basement and first floor and the other for the second floor (bedrooms and bonus room). However, keeping 2 central air conditioning units running is very expensive. That's where this Frigidaire Mini-Compact Air Conditioner comes to the rescue. Now that it's just me and my wife, we don't need to keep the entire 2nd floor cool anymore. I've been testing it for a few weeks and our electric bill is about half of what it was for the same period last year (we are also using more LED lights around the house). Installation was very easy though I didn't use the the screws because I wanted to be able to easily move this little AC to the family room during very hot days. It's light and easy to move and has a small footprint when seen from the outside. I especially like this little Frigidaire because it's \"old school,\" meaning there are good old-fashioned dials and no electronic displays/settings to contend with.

{"review": "I bought this thinking it would probably work for my apartment because my apartment is fairly small. It's just not large enough to do that. It is 5,000 BTU and considering that, it's pretty high powered though. Setup and instillation was a total breeze. This thing may look a little bit ugly (less ugly than many other air conditioners though) but the construction was solid and it's well designed for functionality.

{"review": "Yay, it fits! I have a new shed with a single side-sliding window. The opening is exactly 16\" wide. This Frigidaire came in at about 1mm slimmer. I used vinyl tape from an RV/camping store instead of the included window mounting brackets/slides. So now I have what appears to be more of a professional looking, snug fit than having to build a support system on the exterior. If you look at the picture here on Amazon, you can see two wide legs on the bottom of the unit. Those legs line up exactly with the rail in the window track, giving additional support to prevent slippage. I am very pleased with the A/C. There is an odd, almost small-aircraft-engine kind of sound when it's first turned on, but it runs smooth and relatively quiet after a few seconds.", "id": "3737671"}
{"review": "My toddler and I both have severe allergies and asthma. To the point that over the past month we have both been having major issues with the pollen and smog in the air, even with being home most of the time! I ordered this one after doing A LOT of research, and I decided this was the best for the money. With a true HEPA filter that you replace once a year (opposed to once a month) it would save money in the long run. I chose this one for the den in our house and over the coming weeks we will be getting smaller ones for the bed rooms. This review for right now is 24 hours in to having it on in the house, and later I will come back and add to it. Set up was easy straight out of the box, and I put it out of traffic areas in the house. I was worried with where I put it there would be trouble for good air circulation, but it is doing great! In fact with it on high I noticed a tag on the other side of the room (directly across) was moving on one of the toys yesterday as I was cleaning. Then I cooked fish last night (our den has an open doorway to the kitchen), and I couldnt even smell it cooking!! I decided to test it this morning, and sat on the couch painting my nails. Even using nail polish remover I couldnt smell it!!! (which astounds me b/c I hate doing my nails simple b/c of the toxic fumes!!) As far as noise, its not that bad. On high, with the tv and with kids running around it is a little white noise and thats it. I sleep with the bed room doors open, and having a tower computer on in the den annoyed me, however on medium I couldn't even hear it in the den! It also moves a lot of air b/c even when the ac isnt blowing air, it feels like it is b/c of this tower! I am super excited at the thought of having better air quality in the house so we dont have as many issues, and I know it will take probably a good month for me to be able to judge that (and trust me I keep up with our flair ups b/c my son sees a specialist so I can tell you if it will make a difference or not). I also liked the UV light, since we have kids over to play all the time it makes perfect sense to have it to. Also anyone that has lung issues, make sure to avoid any purifier that has the ion part (where you turn it on for a fresh smell) it actually causes lung problems (if you have underlying problems). Oh and check out the reviews on walmart . com for this purifier, it has hundreds of reviews and most are five star (which is one of the reasons I went with this model even though not everyone loved it on here). Check back in August and I will add an update =) ****************************UPDATE****************************** 12/2/2012 Hi ALL! Sorry took me so long to come back and update =) Fortunately if you see below I did give a heads up three weeks in we still loved it. This unit is holding up well, and really does a good job! Since buying it (I guess going on six months ago now --WOW THAT WENT FAST!!) it helped with our asthma and allergies. Within the first month I stopped waking up with a stuffy nose, and it was taking particles out of the air so I wasn't seeing as much dust. I still would love to have them in each room, but that is on the back burner. Make sure you have enough for the sq footage of your room. We have since moved to a larger place, that has more sq footage in the den, and also two open doorways leading to other rooms. As such, this unit is doing really well for how much air it has availability to; when I should honestly probably should have one more in here. It isn't too loud, and I love the uv light. Within the first month of us having it we were exposed to someone (a visitor) that wound up having pneumonia. With the fact we have a higher risk of catching lung illnesses, I was really nervous. I think a big contributor to not catching it is because we had this unit running on high with the uv light. I highly recommend this unit, and I hope it helps! =) ***********************************Update 6/26/13 We just about hit the year mark! Still working great and going strong! Make sure you wipe down (inside and out) once a month (as the book says). Still going strong, and working well! =) Buy this one, and you wont regret it! ***********************************Update 11/13/13 Unit is still working great! We added a second one earlier this year, and pleased with both! =) ***********************************Update 06/29/14 Both units are still going strong with no issues. Still helping with our asthma and allergies.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I just purchased this device and put it into service yesterday to combat the terrible mold issue in our old apartment, and also because we have dust and cat dander no matter how often I dust and vacuum. Where there is a mold flare up, my daughter coughs all night long (and ends up getting sick), which happened two nights ago and prompted me to make this purchase. Last night however, there was zero coughing. The air actually smells and feels fresh and we both slept incredibly well. Its very quiet, sleek looking, and Energy Star rated so I don't have to worry too much about using it 24-7. The previous review said that it emits a strong plastic odor. That odor is present the minute you take it out of the box, like all new things made of plastic. After running it for about 18 hours, the smell is barely noticeable and I'm sure will continue to fade away. In fact, food odors get trapped in the bedroom every time I cook, but not last night! Its the only room in the house that doesn't smell like the garlicky beef I made for dinner. :)", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I have been running my air purifier 24/7 for almost a month now. I haven't had any problems with this unit. PROS: 1) Really cleans the air- after just a WEEK of use, the outer (carbon) filter was covered in dust! Disgusting, but I'm satisfied to know that wasn't in my lungs. I vacuum the filter once a week. 2) HEPA filter. Although I can't actually \"see\" what it is catching, I know it is helping my air quality! I live in Utah where the inversion pollutes the air on a regular basis during the winter. This air purifier gives me peace of mind, knowing that when I come home I am in a clean air environment. Not only that, but it catches dust mite allergens, pollen, plant spores, bacteria, fungi, mold, smoke, dust..... We are definitely sleeping better at night, not waking up with the usual \"stuff\" that you have to clear out of your throat in the morning... catch my drift? 3) UV light- peace of mind that the germs that are caught by this thing are killed. 4) Catches SMELL (carbon filter)- I am used to smelling leftovers when I let my pots/pans soak in the sink overnight. Not anymore! I know this works because one time we went out of town overnight and turned the unit off. When we came back, our apartment smelled like soaking dishes/leftovers. A smell I'm glad to be rid of using this unit! CONS: 1) When I first got this unit, the lowest setting was pretty quiet. It is noticeably louder now. However, at this setting me and my husband are still able to sleep with the unit in our bedroom at night. AKA not too loud for sleeping (and I used to sleep strictly with earplugs for 2 years straight, so that should tell you something!). Because the fan got louder, I rate this product 4/5 stars. I hope it doesn't continue to get louder. I will update if it does. 2) When we first used it, it did have a \"new\" or plastic/carbon smell to it. I imagine this was the carbon filter. The smell was gone by the second or third day. I recommend this product. It is the best Air purifier/HEPA filter you can get for this price range. Obviously if you spend more money, you can get a much better product that will cover more square footage. **IMPORTANT- the 22\" model can be used up to 155 sq. ft. The 28\" model can be used up to 193 sq. ft. Buy according to your needs. AKA, measure the living space you want to use this unit in. In bigger rooms you will need MORE THAN ONE UNIT if you want this product to work effectively. Just an FYI. ******UPDATE 1/17/14 ******* I contacted customer service about this air purifier becoming louder, and this is what I was told: \"We are sorry to hear of the issue with your AC4825. If you have checked inside of the unit to make sure there is no buildup of dust/debris, and if the filter is still good(the white part is not brown or black), then you can send the unit in for warranty service. Since your product is in need of repair please open the attachment named, \"In-Warranty Repair Form\". After printing the form, follow the instructions on the form in order to have your product repaired. 4 Simple Steps To Returning Your Product For Repair: 1. Print and fill out the applicable Repair Form attached (In-Warranty Repair Form) 2. Pack your complete product (including all parts) in a 16x16x16 box or a smaller sized box for lower cost shipping rates. 3. Send us the applicable Repair Form inside your product package along with the following: a. Provide a copy of your sales receipt or rewards history (REQUIRED) 4. Mail your package to us via UPS, FedEx, or USPS. We recommend you have your package insured. Mailing Address: Guardian Technologies Repair Department 7700 St. Clair Ave. Mentor, OH 44060 Once received, your product unit will be inspected and repaired and our technician will contact you with information on your repair. Normal turnaround time is 10-14 business days.\" So basically if I wanted it to be fixed, I would have to mail it in myself (and pay for shipping). Not the best customer service in the world. I've dealt with several companies who would just send a new unit out (so long as I provided proof my unit would be disposed of, AKA cutting the power cord and sending a picture of that + unit/serial number). I'm NOT going to send it in because I know shipping will cost 1/3 what I paid for this product. No thanks- I'd rather buy a replacement filter for that cost. ******UPDATE 2/22/14 ******* Removed a star from my rating. 3/5 stars because the unit is now almost as loud as the highest setting was when we first got the unit. We are still able to sleep with it on at night, but we no longer keep it on 24/7, and we only keep it on at night a couple days each week. We use it selectively now: 1) High inversion levels 2) Feeling under the weather 3) Cooking that results in lingering smells (fish/fried food, etc) 4) Burned food 5) Allergy season I really wish this unit had stayed whisper quiet like when we first got it. Now (on the lowest setting) it is very loud. At this point it isn't so loud that we can't tune out the sound, but I fear it will get even louder.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I purchased this about 4 months ago, and I have to say, it has changed my life! I have two large dogs and allergies. Though my dogs don't shed much, they still have dander and they used to send me into middle of the night asthmatic fits. I wasn't sleeping a full night through without a double dose of allergy medicine and an inhaler (and even then it was iffy)...Until I got the GermGuardian. Upon first use there was a little of that \"new plastic smell,\" but it went away after about 36 hours of continuously running it. The first night I used it, I took my allergy medicine, but did not have to use the inhaler. Did not wake up once! The second week after using it, I noticed that there was less dust in our bedroom, and I had been able to take my allergy medicine less and less (now maybe once a week if that). In fact, I haven't touched my inhaler in over two months! I am going to buy a second (larger unit) for our upstairs living area. I take the smaller one upstairs while I'm cooking if I am making something that is really smelly (like fried fish or bacon) and run it while I cook. It really helps to minimize the amount of lingering odors. It would be nice to not have to move it around all the time! The best part though...In this yucky cold and flu season, I am pretty sure the GermGuardian kept me from getting full-blown sick! I started to feel a sore throat and stuffy, but it never broke out into a full cold. I have recommended this item to four people who ordered it, and all of them said that they are noticing a huge difference in the air quality in their home. ***ONE THING TO NOTE*** You have to rinse the thinner filter off about every two weeks (and be careful, it can tear easily). I don't recommend vacuuming it (I tore it up, and it didn't seem to get all the crud out). I usually just rinse it out in the tub with cool water and let it air dry for about 5-10 minutes. It will help prolong the Hepa filter in it.", "id": "267554011"}

I mostly use it in the master bedroom which is about 250 sq ft. on the medium (II) setting and it's fine. Sound: While not silent, it's also not annoyingly loud. Sounds like any fan. Use: 3 airflow settings is enough for me. It's an air purifier, not the helm of the USS Enterprise. Looks: Sleek shape, charcoal black color with chrome finish makes this look sharp. It doesn't look clinical/sterile. It's looks detract from a room less than other air purifiers. It's also portable/light enough that I can move it to other rooms with ease. Quality: It doesn't feel cheap. It doesn't squeak, creak or moan when you pick it up and move it around, it's construction feels tight with no play. Negative: The blue UV light indicator: While it looks futuristic and cool during the day, it is very bright in a pitch-black room which keeps me and my lady awake.

{"review": "We were not sure if this would help us with our allergies, but after a winter of very bad allergic reactions, and a double bout of bronchitis, we were feeling ready to try anything. Our doctor said this would be a good idea also. Apparently, the charcoal filter filters out bad air dust mites, allergens, and things, and then the UV thing zaps other bad stuff dead. Hurrah! It's all very scientific. It's only been a week, and it's quite a major difference. After the first night, the air smelled much fresher. We have two cats; and before we received this, we had done our usual hyper-vacuuming, using the enormous lint-roller thingy on the couch, washing the curtains, changing the bedding, etc. That did seem to help a bit. However, we do all these things quite regularly (REALLY), even though our two cats our short-hair. It seems to be more of an allergy problem (we live in TN, and the allergies in this mountainous valley are a hell-hole for everyone- they post allergy alerts on TV). We put this baby on the \"one\" (lowest) setting the first night and noticed a real \" fresh-air\" smell. The second night, we put it on \"two\" and it hummed along, cleaning the air. We slept like babies for the first time in ages. We still have not put it on the \"three\" setting as I'm afraid it will suck our entire house into the filter!! ;))) It is very quiet, and it cleans about 155 square feet of air per hour, so we ordered just one. It does have a glowing blue light, so you might not want to keep it in the bedroom at night. Our shyer cat thinks it is Darth Vader. Both of our cats love to play with the box. Everybody wins!

{"review": "The LASKO 42-INCH WIND CURVE tower fan is a good, reliable fan that does an excellent job cooling our large family room. The recent heat wave (still going on here in Maryland) sent me in search of a fan to supplement our air conditioning and ceiling fan. After reading tons of reviews here on Amazon, I settled on this one - and so far I'm pleased. Pros: 1) The fan comes assembled - only the base needs to be attached (you'll need a Phillips-head screwdriver). I had no trouble getting the two halves of the base to fit together, and then attaching it to the fan itself. The instructions are clear. No problems at all. 2) Operating the fan is easy - whether with the remote control (included) or by using the buttons on the top of the fan. You will need to pick up two AAA batteries for the remote. The buttons are coded with icons to make it easy to turn on the fan, switch speeds, and add oscillation or the ionizer feature. 3) Great job circulating air, with or without using oscillation -- when combined with the ceiling fan in our family room, it really does feel like we're surrounded with comfortable spring breezes! 4) Very, very quiet - in fact, it's much quieter than the little $20 fans we've placed around the room in the past to circulate the air. I hardly notice that it's on at all. Cons: 1) It's a bit large and a tad top-heavy - the base is light-weight plastic, which makes the fan seem a bit top-heavy, especially on thick carpet. So far, we haven't had a problem with this, but I could see it falling over easily if someone bumped into it. 2) Oscillation range is fairly small -- it works fine for two people sitting on the sofa watching TV, but it isn't a wide enough range to effectively reach an entire room full of people. It works for us, since it's usually just my husband and myself. But if you're looking for something that oscillates from one side of the room to the other, this might not be the fan for you. That's about it - if you're looking for a good fan for a reasonable price, I suggest ordering one of these. It's classy-looking too!", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "We have only had this fan now for about a week. I will come back and update my review as time passes, but I wanted to get some info out there. I have a toddler and an infant. Why I was not looking for a fan with blades: Fans with blades can be a danger, but so can the heat, so I decided on a tower style fan for our rather small apartment. Standing fans we have had in the past were easily tipped and the front metal plate or sometimes plastic was quick to pop off as it hit the floor blade still going strong. Very scary when your child is just 2 and has tipped the fan. My experience so far: *auto shut off The first day I was quite worried as the fan had tipped (my husband the larger child in the home was playing with it) and it would not turn back on. I became very worried. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Sure enough this fan has a safety so that if it is tipped it will turn off. *durability So far the baby has tackled it with his 26lb body and it has held up. It is just tall enough that my toddler can't yet push the buttons. *noise I didn't really care if the fan was quiet or not, but it was an added bonus that it is very quiet compared to our Lasko box fan. If you aren't looking at the fan you would never know that it is rotating. Also make sure you get the screws in the right place. The diagram is poorly labeled. That may be the problem with some of the fans people are having noise with. There are more holes than there are screws and the diagram suggests that they go into holes that they really don't belong in. I will include a picture of the base so you can see. *cooling factor I was disappointed with the amount of air that it moved, and had I reviewed it on day 1 I would have only given it a 3 stars for that, but I have come to realize that while the air it moves isn't much, the air always blows out cool. I find that on hot humid summer days some fans are just blowing around the hot air. I was surprised to find that this fan seems to always have cool air. No idea how but it does. It also does a much better job cooling a room if you always have it on rotate. If not the air just kind of stagnates. *packaging I was very worried when it arrived as it was in the thin box the fan comes in rather than amazon packaging. It already had holes in it. I will be reviewing in my order the packaging as well and I suggest others do the same so they start packing it better. *ion thing Tried it doesn't seem to change anything other than a blue light comes on. I have no idea what it actually does. Again bought this fan for safety reasons. *overall I am pleased and hope to buy another when funds allow. Update: It has been about a month now and while my toddler has tackled this fan with his full body weight it is still fully functioning. It has only actually crashed once of the many times hitting wood laminate floors. Now that the weather is warmer it is still blowing cooler air than any other fan in our home. Update: One year later; it is still running great and quietly. The toddler has finally stopped tackling it, but it has survived several falls over the year. Update: It is now June 2014 and we own two of these fans and both are going strong despite a toddler and autistic 6 year old who can now reach the buttons. They also survived a trip in a moving truck to our new home. We have more of an open floor plan now, so two doesn't really cut it for the kitchen/dining room/living room space. The air kind of gets lost, so what I do to help them better cool a room is put them on opposite corners and face them at each other. I plan to buy one more so I can have one in every room in the open space. It also doesn't help that our new home has very old crank windows that only open at an angle and only so far.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "We have only had this fan now for about a week. I will come back and update my review as time passes, but I wanted to get some info out there. I have a toddler and an infant. Why I was not looking for a fan with blades: Fans with blades can be a danger, but so can the heat, so I decided on a tower style fan for our rather small apartment. Standing fans we have had in the past were easily tipped and the front metal plate or sometimes plastic was quick to pop off as it hit the floor blade still going strong. Very scary when your child is just 2 and has tipped the fan. My experience so far: *auto shut off The first day I was quite worried as the fan had tipped (my husband the larger child in the home was playing with it) and it would not turn back on. I became very worried. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Sure enough this fan has a safety so that if it is tipped it will turn off. *durability So far the baby has tackled it with his 26lb body and it has held up. It is just tall enough that my toddler can't yet push the buttons. *noise I didn't really care if the fan was quiet or not, but it was an added bonus that it is very quiet compared to our Lasko box fan. If you aren't looking at the fan you would never know that it is rotating. Also make sure you get the screws in the right place. The diagram is poorly labeled. That may be the problem with some of the fans people are having noise with. There are more holes than there are screws and the diagram suggests that they go into holes that they really don't belong in.

{"review": "One of the other reviewers mentioned that this fan's remote only works if you aim the remote directly at the fan and that you aren't too far away. Wow, were they ever right. You have to aim the remote dead on to the sensor to get it to work, often times pushing the button several times before it does work. We've moved the fan now so that it is past the foot of the bed and I can't use the remote anymore. The fan is too far away. If I want to use the remote in bed, I have to slide all the way to the bottom corner of the bed, lean forward and aim the remote directly at the fan's sensor. It's not worth it anymore, now I just get out of bed to turn it on and off. Kind of defeats the purpose of having the remote. Now, the pros is that it looks great, the sound is even and on the quieter side (but we like the white noise when we sleep), and fairly powerful air movement. You can direct the air pretty accurately. I still feel a great breeze even though it is kinda far away from the bed. The ION feature is really nice and even seems to cool the air in addition to filtering it. Another note: the \"ION\" light is REALLY bright. It was like having a nightlight in our bedroom. Additionally, the plastic cover that goes over the light and indicator panel is kind of transparent, so when I tried covering the light with electrical tape I realized the light isn't just coming out of the \"light hole,\" it's also coming out most of the transparent plastic cover too, which is kinda large. I ended up having to cover about half of the indicator panel with electrical tape and I can still see the light. I wish it would just go off after a certain period of being on, but no such luck. I'm sure me having to use that much electrical tape (which fortunately blends in well) doesn't help the remote sensor issue.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I'm not sure how to review this, really. The package appeared at my doorstep looking the exact way it would if I were to put it in a shopping cart at walmart. Speaking of which, you can get this for $40 from walmart online, but here's the kicker: I literally received this the second day after I ordered it, and I didn't pay any shipping charges at all. If that could happen for all of my shipments, I'd gladly pay the extra $15 every time I ordered online. As for the actual product, I'm torn again. The ionizer is obviously a sham(as in nothing more than a blue light on the machine), because there's no way to actually clean it(and really that's assuming I believed that ionizers worked in the first place). The fan itself is fantastic. It's absolutely huge, and even on low it blows a more than adequate amount of air. I've read some reviews online about this item breaking after about a year of usage, usually the parts that allow it to oscillate, then the fan itself. I see this as being easily fixed by simply keeping it in one position and keeping it on the low setting, which again is beyond adequate. On low this basically pushes the same amount of air as a box fan does on medium, but has a much more natural \"breeze\" feel and does so at about a third of the decibels. Oh, and the remote is awesome. For all my gripes, this is a fantastic product and is well beyond my expectations.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I have never purchased a tower fan before so I have nothing to compare to, but I would say this is a good fan, not great, but good. It does move a ton of air. Maybe even too much, I don't put it on a higher speed than 1 because the 2nd and 3rd speed is very strong and blows papers and other things all around the room. The ionizer I use very little. It gives me a headache, and I have heard nothing but negaitive things about ionizers so I don't use it, but that is not why I purchased this fan anyway. The main reason I chose this fan over other tower fans was for looks. I love the wood on the front, and it looks very pleasing to the eye, unlike most fans. I think one of the worst parts of this fan, unlike previous reviews, is the noise. The fan itself makes little noise but the air it pushes around makes a lot of noise, even at low speeds. It is not something terrible, and can sometimes be relaxing, almost like the sound of a constant breeze or wind, but can sometimes get distracting/annoying Overall I would recommend this fan to anyone who wants to buy a fan with ionizer and great looks. If the ionizer and looks aren't important to you I might go with a cheeper fan.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I did not buy this from Amazon because they were charging $199 and here in Texas Amazon has to charge 6.25% sales tax. I bought this one on Ebay for $185 free shipping. WAC5300 $159 vs WAC5500 $199. I have 2 WAC5300's and 1 WAC5500. WAC5500 1) This model does come with a remote. The remote is very useful turning it on and changing fan speeds. It is the only way to turn off the plasma wave. 2) Washable Hepa filter. I have serious doubts that you can effectively wash a Hepa filter. There are no instructions for cleaning it either. 3) External color 4) On fan speed #2 this unit (5500) is quieter I have had this air purifier for 2 months now. It works great for us. I use it mostly on the 2nd lowest speed #2. The air in the bedroom where I use this one is always very fresh now. This model is a little quieter than the 5300. Both my 5300's you can hear the motor making a faint whining sound on speed #2 only. The 5500 does not make this sound making it best for the bedroom. I bought this primarily for: 1) cleaning the air of out-gassing from plastics/synthetics, paint, particle board, carpet etc. 2) No one in the family has any allergies, but I was interested in lowering the pollen, mold spores and dust especially in spring and summer when we all get runny noses from time to time. 3) I have a 5yr old son and want to keep the indoor air as clean as possible for his health. IT WORKS FOR DETECTING AND CLEANING PLASTIC/SYNTHETICS OUT-GASSING: I bought a memory foam topper to soften up a hard mattress and it feels great. However there were many complaints about chemical smell and that it needs a few days to air out before using. When I received it, I noticed a minor smell but used it that night since I am not sensitive to the odor. (2.5\" Lucid by LinenSpa Gel Infused Ventilated Memory Foam Mattress Topper with Removable Bamboo Cover, QUEEN) ****This product detected the new mattress odor the 1st night and and while on auto kicked into #3 fan speed for about 45min. The air quality meter was at 4 bars of 5 and gradually declined to \"good air quality\". This continued for several days even though I couldn't smell it anymore. **** I smoke outside (never inside) and both models occasionally detect the small amount of smoke left in my lungs when I come in the house. This truly surprised me. For LIGHT SLEEPERS like me: For use in the bedroom I use a timer to shut the unit off between 4am and 5am when I am most likely to wake up from fan noise. The unit is very quiet at speed 1). Speed 2) is also quiet but can wake me up at around 5am. The timer I use is Belkin Conserve Energy Saving Outlet. It can be set for 30 min, 3 hours and 6 hours. So, I set it for 6 hours and turn it on at 10pm. It shuts off the air cleaner at 4am. Perfect for me. Power consumption by fan speed: Off 1.3W Auto) 5W 1) 5W 2) 15W 3) 38W 4) Turbo 77W Fan noise: 1) Very difficult to hear in a very quiet room at night. 2) Minor white noise, fine for daytime use but may be too noisy for light sleepers. 3) Sound kicks up a few notches, fine for brief periods but too much for all day use. 4 Turbo loud Plasma Wave noise: None. I can only hear something when the fan is on #1 low and I listen at the air outlet vent. My modifications: Surprisingly these all fit 1) I added a second charcoal filter to increase the effectiveness of cleaning odor and synthetics out-gassing. Carbon filters are VERY IMPORTANT to cleanse the air of very small pollutants. Pollutants too small for the HEPA filter to catch. Change the carbon more often than 3 months. You can buy cut to fit ACTIVATED CARBON filters here on Amazon for 7-10$ for 2. 2) I bought a washable pre-filter to keep dust from blocking the charcoal's cleaning and extend the life of the Hepa filter. This prefilter is a little narrow on the width by 1/4\" but works well Duck Brand 1285234 24-Inch by 15-Inch by 1/4-Inch Foam Air Conditioner Filter Charcoal filter vs Activated carbon: They have similar cleaning abilities but Activated Carbon is many times more effective than charcoal or carbon. For those that want to know, here is why: Activated carbon is processed carbon or charcoal. It is processed with steam to create millions microscopic holes and channels that trap the sub micron particles that pollute your air and that can't be cleaned by the hepa filter. Activated carbon is used commercially to purify air and drinking water. I will be replacing the charcoal filter with Activated carbon filter. Cut-to-fit Carbon for Air Purifiers Air quality sensor: I was skeptical about the air quality sensor but it has detected some cooking odors and plastic out-gassing so far. My only concern is how long will it work and I seriously doubt it will detect everything. Most sensors need some maintenance (more than the vacuuming recommended in the manual). ****But maybe it's not important in the long run as you become confident the air cleaner works and you change the carbon filters at the recommended 3 months or sooner. A little about me: I am a practicing Electronic Engineer with over 20 yrs experience analyzing electronic components and engineering modifications to improve performance or fix defects. The price performance of this product is very good. I rate it 5 stars. Thank you to all the reviewers of this product and other air purifiers sold on Amazon. You have helped me make a good choice in the $200 price range.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I purchased this today at Fry's Electronics for $199, but really wanted a 5300 model, which they were out of as it is being discontinued. Later I found 5300 model could be purchased at Walgreens for $149. The only difference between the two as far as I can see is that there is a washable filter in the 5500, which might save me some money in the long run. My home showed \"green\" but I put it on the top speed to clear out the air anyway. It is loud at that speed, but very quiet at first 2 speeds. Later I will like the auto mode which switches to whatever the sensor thinks the fan should be on according to air quality. It is nice looking. I can't say much now but it seems a little overpriced to me. I did not buy the extended warranty and hope nothing goes wrong as it only has a 1 year warranty. You still must replace the carbon filters every 3 months. Besides the one in the unit they give you 3 more carbon filters so this should last a year but maybe more if I vacuum it. The other washable filter should be washed every 6 months and can be washed 6 times and then must be replaced. UPDATE: 6/6/11 I really like the Winix 5500, so much that I purchased a Winix 5300 from Walgreens and in the future will get the washable filter that Winix 5500 uses and put it in the 5300. Both machines are quiet, clears the air, are sensitive to air quality. My rooms appear to be so much fresher and I'm happy with my purchases.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "My business requires me to speak a great deal, so keeping my lungs and sinuses clear is important to me. (Who needs a speaker who's constantly coughing?!) This cleaner works beautifully and if you dislike disagreeable odors or dust or particles in the air you breathe - or want to combat viruses or bacteria, you will appreciate this relatively inexpensive model. I went with the Winix 5500 vs the 5300 for the 'washable' feature of one of the replaceable filters for the Winix 5500 includes a washable HEPA filter that the website claims 'lasts 3 times as long as traditional non-washable HEPA filters'. The PlasmaWave feature also picks up on scent and will rev up to a higher speed automatically if scent is detected - even a spray of perfume five feet away will get it going, so for those who are scent-intolerant, this device would be a blessing. (The company says the plasma feature 'generates both positive and negative plasma clusters which instantly neutralize viruses, bacteria, chemical vapors, and odors in the air.') The remote control allows you to increase or decrease (override) the automatic fan speed, depending on what you want, even though an automatic setting is determined the first 15 minutes you have it plugged in. It is wonderfully quiet on the normal (low) speed (you can sleep easily with it running), and even at the highest speed, it is no more noisy than your computer's fan on high. (In my opinion, anyway.) Also, there is a 'sleep mode' setting if you want the indicator lighting to dim at to dark at night, and the fan will also move to the 'low' setting if it were not there already. (I've not bothered to 'dim' the lights, but I might try that out in the future. If I'm unhappy with it, I'll update this review.) I liked this unit so much, I purchased another - the exact same model. I purchased this second unit from Amazon.com so as to receive it faster and am glad they packaged it for shipping with all the same 'superior care' with which my first unit was shipped - although the first one needed 'special instructions' and a 'delay of shipping' to get what Amazon.com delivered without such special instructions. Thank you, Amazon. There was only one 'con', and I can live with it: It asks you to place the unit 2 feet from the wall, so for someone needing to use it in a tight area, they may find that requirement cumbersome. (I list dimensions for the unit below.) For me, I just put it in the corner, and it was easy to comply with that distance requirement. The conditioned air exits through the top and circulates well. I found the 'plasma' feature on both my units is completely silent.

Remote Control->Yes Unit Dimensions->16.3\"(W) x 8.5\"(D) x 21.7\"(H) Unit Weight->15.0 pounds (I had no trouble setting up or moving this unit and I am not a weight lifter :) ) ***NOTE*** The filters arrive packed inside inexplicably in the reverse order than they should be installed. 1.Starting from the machine, you insert the HEPA filter with the tabs facing towards you - towards the the front cover. The FRONT arrow label on the filter is misleading as it's pointing to the BACK of the machine, so the word FRONT is nearest the front door of the machine, and the arrow's tip is pointing to the BACK of the machine. 2. Next lay in the charcoal filter being sure the tabs of the HEPA filter stick out around it. This is so you can get those filters out easily when you want to replace them or wash the HEPA filter. 3. Close it up and press the filter reset button as directions dictate so you are told when the filter needs replacing. I am quite pleased with this purchase. Update: Still pleased. But for those who'd like the filter information, here are the possible FILTER REPLACEMENTS for the WAC5500: 1. One Washable HEPA filter Part #115122 (This comes with the unit when you purchase it. Washable - water only; expected to last 3 years)Sylvane.com has them free shipping. You use this with one of the carbon part #115115 filters to complete the filtering parts. 2. Four Carbon Filters Part #115119 (These also come with the unit when you purchase it.) (Not Washable) Sylvane.com has these with free shipping. 3. One Winix 115115 True HEPA Plus 4 Replacement Filter (Dispose after use - Not washable and about $66.00 for the set and can pick it up at Bed Bath and Beyond if you need it right this instant or save yourself the hassle and order it on Amazon) 4.

{"review": "This is a great air purifier for the price. The build quality on the machine is above average compared to other similarly priced air purifiers on the market, and it has an attractive two tone silver/white finish that blends in with the environment. The LED interface looks great and has a slightly high-tech look to it. There is a SLEEP mode that dims the LEDs in a dark room. The purifier draws air from the front and dispels the cleaned air from the top of the unit. It is a 3-Stage cleaning unit (Carbon Filter --> HEPA Filter --> Plasmawave Ionizer), and the air dispelled from the purifier smells CLEAN. Information on Ozone: Some air purifiers create Ozone during their ionization process. Since this uses a \"plasma\" technology, the Ozone creation is minimal. This particular model only creates 3 ppb when Plasmawave is turned on. This is far below the FDA recommended 50 ppb limit. The box advertises a \"NO OZONE\" logo with information on Ozone production. There is no distinct Ozone smell that some other purifiers create. CADR Specs: 350 sqr/ft room Smoke: 235 Dust: 248 Pollen: 251 When the purifier is set to Auto mode, it uses the air sensor to change the speed of the fan when needed. It never goes to Turbo mode when set to Auto, so the High setting is the loudest it will get. Most of the time in Auto mode, the fan is set to Low. On Low you can not hear the fan unless you are close to it and the Plasmawave is set to OFF. On Medium the fan is slightly audible and the Plasmawave is turned on. Some complain of a weird almost \"clicking\" noise when the fan is on Medium with Plasmawave on, and this is true. It is VERY quiet (at least on my machine) and I only hear it if I am right next to the purifier and actively listening for it. This might be a problem for those who have this is their bedroom, but you can turn off the Plasmawave with the provided remote. On High, the fan is clearly audible and the Plasmawave is turned on. You cannot hear the Plasmawave noise when the fan is set to High. Turbo is very loud and Plasmawave is turned on, but it moves a lot of air in this mode and is really useful for clearing out a room quickly. Even though it is loud it isn't that obnoxious. The air sensor that is installed on this device is extremely sensitive, holding up anything that gives off an odor automatically triggers the purifier to increased the fan speed depending on how bad the odor is. Nail Polish, food odors, laundry have all set the sensor off even if the smells are faint. FYI: The sensor is an Odor sensor, not a Particle sensor, so it does not detect dust or pet hair. The remote is a little bulky but is very handy. You can manually turn the fan from Low --> Turbo, turn Plasmawave Off/On, turn the purifier Off/On, and set up the different modes. You cannot activate the Auto mode with the remote, but turning off the purifier off then on again automatically turns the Auto feature on. The remote sits in a designated holder on the top of the purifier. To wash the HEPA filter, hold it under a stream of room temperature water at a 45 degree angle and thoroughly rinse it. Then let it air dry for 12-24 hours or until dry to the touch. Make sure to grasp the edge of the filter and not the inner \"flaps\" because you can damage/warp them when they are wet. You can also vacuum the HEPA filter occasionally, but I am not sure if it will increase its lifespan. Some things I did not like about the purifier were the lack of handles on the sides. It isn't a very heavy unit but handles would make moving it from room to room much easier. Also, the lack of an Auto button on the remote is slightly annoying. The carbon filters are thin compared to other units and are a little expensive. The lack of a particle sensor is also a con.

{"review": "Let me start by saying that I have a lot to say but I will try and keep it short. The WAC5500 is truly the best thing to happen to my family - with colds, allergies, and dog hair. I read all of the reviews, I don't buy things without fully vetting it and I will say this thing really is the best bang for your buck on the market. Reasons I purchased it: - allergybuyersclub * Rated this 4/5 stars - Pricing vs air flow (square foot covered) - This thing is the #1. - Cost of filter replacements - Long-term usage / reliability - Ability to set to sleep mode - Ability to enable/disable the \"PlasmaWave\" technology setting. - AUTOMATIC setting which detects odors and dust - thereby increasing or decreasing fan speed on it's own. *** Let me explain some of the above mentioned in a informal way: I purchased one and found it was everything I wanted in an air cleaner. It moves TONS of air (in fact turbo setting is quite loud but that's the only setting that is very loud). This thing blows like an air conditioner when it gets going. The air in the house smells fresh and clean always! The automatic setting (as others have mentioned) is a bit deceptive since the airflow intake is based on the speed of the fan so in it's lowest setting, the ability for it to detect odors/dust is dramatically decreased from when it is on high or turbo. However, it does work and my dog can literally pass gas in the same room and this thing will detect it and increase the fan speed to correct it. Once clear, it decreases the fan speed. This has been running non-stop since March 19, 2013. The day I received it - I turned it on and it has not been off. We have changed filters about 3 days ago. It stays on a low-mid setting which is the one right above low. No issues at all. It is made in Korea - I'm not a fan of buying overseas and prefer to purchase U.S.- goods but there simply isn't a cost-effective version comparable. My home is 4400 sq. foot and I have 2 filters downstairs (9500 + 5500) and one 5500 upstairs. We have 2 dogs, 2 ferrets, and 2 children. There is a lot of pet hair and my wife's hair/hair sprays, etc for these to deal with. They work beautifully and despite everything, our house smells so fresh people cannot believe we have animals at all. There is so much more to say about the filters, how you can buy the permanent ones, which I recommend HIGHLY. They can be just vacuumed, all that needs to be replace in those is the carbon pre-filter. I can't say enough... We were all sick (CONSTANTlY) prior to buying these and since we have had FAR less allergies and migraines from the allergies/colds. These have been worth their weight in gold. PLASMAWAVE: I don't recommend ever actually running this other than maybe an hour if you're running to the store, etc. If you leave it on it tends to dry out the air and my wife has gotten headaches due to the dryness in the home. We turn this on once a week when we're leaving to run to town. Just leave it on an hour or so and the house will be smelling so fresh. The beauty is the plasma wave can be turned off and the unit still runs and cleans the air. It's not a requirement and honestly, this unit is worth every penny without it. Best of luck - I truly believe anyone looking to purchase a unit to cover their entire home and be cost effective while doing it - simply will not be disappointed. Again, I own 3 and they have all been running for 8 months with 0 problems and working like the day I turned them on. In fact, I am about to order one for my parents for Christmas. Hopefully this long and rambling review will help someone.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I'm serious. This thing spins up to high when you blast. It's surprisingly responsive, as well. Within 15 seconds of farting, from across the room, vroooooooOOOOOOOOOOO off it goes. This is hilarious to show to your friends, but at the same time, you might want to shut it off if you have a date over because it may out one or both of you, and create an embarrassing \"no joy\" end to the evening. I got two of these and bought them around Jan 2013 for an approximately 900 sqft apartment. One in the bedroom and one in the living room. The pair do a good job keeping the apartment allergen free and smelling clean. I try to make a habit of cracking a couple windows when I leave for work, and if I don't, the air is noticeably stale when I return, but not if I leave one of these guys running. Additionally, if I don't turn them on for a week or so, my allergies slowly get worse, eventually leading to mild coughing which wakes me from sleep. I fire these back up and within 24 hours the symptoms are gone. I like these now that I've purchased them. However, when I bought them, they were doing a two-for-one deal that also came with extra filters, so they were quite a bit cheaper. If they were to fail down the road, I would probably buy another one, though. The unit in it's lowest mode is very quiet, but it gets very LOUD when it spins up, and it does this when it detects odors. You can manually override the speed, however. If you don't mind background hum, similar to a fan, dishwasher, white noise machine, etc. the normal operation won't bother you. If you're one of those types that needs absolute silence, the sound may bother you. People have mentioned an occasional tinkling or crackling sound with the Plasmawave on. I've not noticed this. One lame design move is you can only turn off the plasmawave with the remote, so don't lose it! I don't use the remote much, but it might be handy for those who want to tuck it into a corner or behind a chair that will later be a hassle to get to. For example, if you're watching a movie while eating dinner, the dinner odors will likely cause the unit to spin up. The remote will save you an awkward fuss when you're just trying to relax, eat and watch a show. When I was struggling with allergies a year ago, I was tempted to be my usual cheap self and buy a crappy $40 filter to see if it worked, but I'm glad I didn't. These things set me back about $250 for the pair but the improvement in sleep and quality of life has been noticeable. I actually was able to shelve a prescription allergy med and my mood and energy are bit better because I'm getting better sleep.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I'm pretty satisfied with the machine in general, but the washable filter leaves a lot to be desired. First, when you wash it, it doesn't seem like like something that's supposed to be washed - it gets waterlogged, stays dirty looking, and the filter can be bent out of shape if you're not careful. Second, instead of lasting three years, the \"change filter\" light went on a mere 7 months after I bought the 5500. Finally, the washable replacement filter (SKU 115122) is impossible to find. You can buy them from the Winix site for $80 + $15 shipping (no carbon filters included), but good luck finding them anywhere else. You might as well save yourself $40 and get the 5300 model since you're probably going to end up using the non-washable filters anyway. I wouldn't recommend buying a Winix, though. This model is a bit of a bait-and-switch and you shouldn't support a company that engages in such shady sales tactics.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "When \"Tropical Storm\" Sandy brought 5 feet of water in my back door and out the front door, mold and mold spores was my biggest concern. I did my homework and ordered the WAC5500 which had a washable filter and remote control. (The WAC5000 does not have either). The reviews said that the unit was noisy on high. If the sound of a small air conditioner bothers you, then it's noisy but really... The unit monitors air quality and adjusts itself accordingly. You can tell by the color of the LED gauge how your air is doing. It is light weight and I can move it to anywhere in my house easily.It doesn't take up a whole lot space. It is also has some sleek styling. Best of all, I have not seen any mold.", "id": "267554011"}

Works, when I wake up in the morning, nose cleaner than when i didn't have winix 5500 4. can turn off plasmawave from remote so at night it's a lot quitter when sleeping 5. since getting unit, haven't woken up with a headache, and my stuffy nose only once so a major improvement 6. eliminate odors - cooking, perfumes, etc Cons : 1. on remote, doesn't have auto feature, will have to setup auto from the unit itself 2. Plasmawave makes some cracking noise, not loud but noticeable when sleeping Other Comments : it's a powerful unit/fan so when set on Max, it will make room cold not good for weathertime LOL but it does clean up the air of dust and other stuff. Thinking of getting another one for my computer room so I don't have to carry my only one back and forth between rooms added the extra 1 for 5 stars since this unit is great!

{"review": "Overall: I suffer from bad allergies and we had been replacing filters in a HEPA Type air cleaner that resided in our bedroom every two months. A quick run of the numbers (Filter cost, CADRE, CFM) made it clear that upgrading would not only provide better cleaner air but also save us money in the long run. Now that we have this I wake up with a clearer head than ever before and I am looking forward to replacing filters much less frequently. Effectiveness: It works better than the HEPA Type filter we used previouslt. I can breathe easily when I wake up which I can't when I don't use the air cleaner. The PlasmaWave feature definitely results in odors being cleared more quickly than when it's not turned on. The PlasmaWave feature also changes the fragrance of the air a bit. I do like that I can turn PlasmaWave off when desired, a feature not included on the WAC5300. Filters: The device comes with one washable True HEPA filter and four carbon mesh pre-filters. The carbon pre-filters are supposed to be replaced every 3 months. The HEPA filter is supposed to be washed every 6-months and can, supposedly, be washed a maximum of 6 times. I haven't washed the filter yet but I will be a bit surprised if it holds up to 6 washings. In the future I will likely replace it with the non-washable disposable filter. Note that any of Winix's size 20 filters (Ultimate Cassette, washable HEPA+ carbon (included), or non-washable/disposable HEPA + Carbon) can be used as replacements as indicated by Winix's filter guide located here: [...] Sound: This thing is dead silent in sleep mode. So quiet I wouldn't believe it was running if I couldn't feel the air coming out of it. So quiet that we run it on the 2nd fan level while we sleep because we like the soft white noise. On Turbo the Winix WAC5500 is very loud but it also moves a tremendous amount of air. As others have mentioned, the airflow from Turbo mode on the air cleaner makes the ceiling fan in our bedroom spin without being switched on. Cost: I did the math on filter replacement costs and compared the Winix to air cleaners from Rabbit and others. The Winix filters are a better $/day and offer the same True HEPA filtration efficiency as more expensive units. Other stuff: -The air cleaner is made of plastic but build quality is good. I have no doubts that this unit will stand the test of time. -The auto mode seems to work reasonably well. We leave it on auto during the day and then I kick it to Turbo when I get home from work and then back down to level 2 for easy sleeping. Cons: It doesn't have a carry handle. It's not heavy so carrying on occasion from one room to another it isn't a big deal but a hand hold location would be convenient.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I do not recommend Honeywell brand HRF-AP1, HRF-APP1 or 38002 because : (1) Prefilters HRF-AP1, HRF-APP1 or 38002 (all made in Mexico) are thinner and much lower quality than the original prefilter that comes with the air purifier or the generic ones made in US, Korea or China that I bought before. The prefilter 38002 is basically the same quality, thickness and porosity as prefilter HRF-AP1 except for the higher price. I suspect HRF-AP1 and 38002 are the same exact items with a different box and price. (2) The pores or holes are bigger, many 3 mm or bigger. You can see clearly many big holes by holding the prefilter against the light. The prefilter is also covered with fine black carbon dusts. My hands and table are covered with carbon dusts. That means many particles including the carbon dusts are bypassing the prefilter causing the HEPA filter to clog up faster. Without prefilter, the HEPA filter (about $60 or more) lasts only 4 to 6 months, instead of 1 to 2 years. (3) Prefilter HRF-APP1 ( suggested retail $ 17.99) has \"loose\" zeolite added. (4) You get a better deal by buying prefilters from generic suppliers. The generic filters I have bought are less expensive, thicker and have much less loose black carbon dusts than ones from Kaz and Honeywell. Plus you usually get 2 filters for Honeywell 50250 air purifier instead of 1.

Both filters are sold by Industrial Filter Sales, etc. and are thicker, denser than HRF-AP1, HRF-APP1 or 38002.

The definitions of \"HEPA\" and \"CADR\" are placed at the end of this review. Please vote for this review if you like it :) I appreciate it. **Kimmer (another reviewer) has kindly uploaded a wonderful youtube video to demonstrate the noise level, title: \"Honeywell Enviracare 50250 air purifier\". Since your computer speaker will affect the demonstrated noise level, make sure you gauge the noise to Kimmer's voice.** Pros: Powerful, inexpensive, permanent HEPA filter, easy to maintain, 360 degree air intake and output, portable, accessible replacement parts, good support from Kaz, a 5 year limited warranty. Cons: Noisy, high power consumption, not stylish. Previously I owned the Honeywell HFD-130 Germicidal Tower HEPA Air Purifier with Permanent IFD Filter, but due to its ozone emission and my respiratory problem, I returned it back to HomeDepot. I got fully refunded and bought this Honeywell 50250N on the same day and loved it. I have a mild allergy. I sneeze and experience itchy eyes when I am outdoor, but stop when I am at home (where my purifier is). I recommend two important points when shopping for a purifier: (1) always examines the CADR number. It is a decent performance indicator, (2) always buys an air purifier adequate for your need. A 100 sq ft purifier will not work for a 1000 sq ft living space. Honeywell 50250N is a true HEPA filter purifier with a 250 CADR, which translates into a recommended 375 square feet usage space. Currently, this purifier is being sold at ~$160. It has been quoted as the only purifier <$200 that can clean air effectively by Consumer Reports, Consumer Search, Air-purifier America. For most HEPA purifiers, the filter replacement is the highest up-keeping cost and is ~$100 annually. 50250N has a permanent Lifetime HEPA filter which can save a lot of money. The purifier has an activated carbon prefilter which protects the HEPA filter and absorbs traces level of volatile molecules, sources for odors. The prefilter is recommended to be replaced every 3 months for optimal odor removal. If odor removal is not needed, then the prefilter does not need to be replaced regularly. This purifier has a 360 degree air intake and air exhaust, making it effective at circulating air. The unit weighs in 20.1 pounds and all parts are large and sturdy. Replacement parts are relatively easy to find. I have seen them at my local Target, Home Depot, Walmart and Sears from time to time. The unit vibrates slightly at its lowest fan speed and air \"pulses\" out of the unit. Kaz consumer service was very helpful in explaining this. The small vibration is due to slow air buildup across HEPA filter. The vibration is considered as a normal feature and does not affect its performance. I did my own test to prove this, and you can too: take your HEPA filter out of the unit and run it, and the purifier should stop wobbling. This proves the vibration is due to air buildup, not an imbalance fan. The unit has two major shortcomings. It is noisy at the highest fan speed, and noticeable at the lowest fan speed. For those who wonder if you can tolerate the noise, it is not a machine cranking noise. It is a high air flow sound. If you have any doubt, you can always buy this unit from a respected local store, so that you can return it easily. The purifier also has a high power consumption of 170/120/50 watts at the three fan speeds. This purifier is not stylish. Is Honeywell 50250N the best purifier? Absolutely not! IQ Air purifiers are considered the very best, but their cheapest model is $700 and many are above $1000. Honeywell 50250N is one of the most effective purifiers in its prize range: <$200. In comparison, we will look at Whirlpool AP450 which is rated as number 1 by Consumer Reports, and Ionic Breeze Quadra which has a very large market. Whirlpool AP450 has a ~330 CADR rating and costs $250. This yields a nice ratio of 1.3 CADR/$, which means you get 1.3 CADR capability for every dollar spent. Honeywell 50250N has an even better ratio of 1.6 CADR/$. The two purifiers are also competitive in term of the operation cost. AP450 is energy star certified using only 105 W, whereas 50250N has a permanent HEPA filter. In the case both purifiers run at full speed continuously (24/7) and the electricity cost is $0.1 per kWh (average in USA), the annual electricity costs will be $92 and $150 for AP450 and 50250N, respectively. The AP450 saves an annual $60 in electricity, but costs an annual $90 for HEPA filter replacement. Of course, AP450 is more powerful, so when considering the cleaning power per annual cost, they are almost the same. On the other hand, Ionic Breeze is a disappointment. It has an estimated 10-20 CADR and it costs over $300 -- a ridiculous 0.03-0.07 CADR/$ ratio. It was the worst purifier tested independently by Consumer Reports and Air-Purifier-America. Moreover, ionic breeze produces a high level of ozone, which Consumer Reports has issued health warnings. You can easily find the related news on the web. (Honeywell 50250N has the Lifetime HEPA filter, but Honeywell 50250 does not. I ordered my second Honeywell from BeachCamera through Amazon, but the one arrived is the 50250 version. I called and BeachCamera admitted it does not have 50250N. I finally got my refund, but it was a hassle.) A spotlight review here claims Sharp Plasmacluster FP-N60CX is a better purifier. I disagree. FP-N60CX has a 210 CADR and is sold at ~$350 - less powerful and more expansive. The review justifies this expense by stating that the FP-N60CX needs one carbon filter replacement in 5 years and consequently saves $200 in 5 years. This is a math error. The carbon filter replacement for Honeywell 50250N costs $200 in 5 year, but FP-N60CX also needs replacement at the end of 5 years at $80. This is a $120 difference in 5 years. The 5 years replacement is also the best case scenario, as it may need to be replaced as early as in 2 years which results in no cost advantage. According to its operation manual (available online), the FP-N60CX carbon filter needs to be cleaned every 2 months using a 6-steps cleaning process: (1) vacuum clean (2) soak in detergent mixture for 30 minute (3) scrub with a toothbrush (4) rinse with clean water (5) remove excess water with a big towel for 1-2 days (6) hang up and air dry for another 1-2 days. In one year, this may result up to a month-worth downtime. Let's summarize this: $120 saving for cleaning the carbon filter 30 times in 5 years. You save $4 for each cleaning. Since each cleaning can take an hour, this equates $4 per hour of labor. You cannot even pay an illegal immigrant to do this! I also want to reiterate that Honeywell 50250N has a permanent HEPA filter, which can be regenerated by vacuum cleaning. It takes 3 minutes to do and need to be done twice a year. Considering the typical HEPA replacement costs $100 annually, each filter cleaning saves $50. That is $50 for 3 minutes of your time, or $1000 for an hour. This is a real saving. The \"plasmacluster\" feature is somewhat of a gimmick. Major hospitals, national, pharmaceutical and computer research labs use HEPA for air purification. One last point about vacuum cleaning the Lifetime HEPA filter: a HEPA grade cleaner is recommended to regenerate the HEPA filter. Otherwise, the particles on the Lifetime HEPA will be dispersed back into the air during vacuuming. If you are suffering from a serious allergy or asthma, then you should consider owning a HEPA vacuum cleaner to begin with. Alternatively, you can vacuum the filter outside of your home so the fine particles are dispersed outside, such as your patio. Yes, and if you are really funny, you can secretly do this at your ex-girlfriend's room. I am kidding! Definitions: HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) is a filter grade strictly defined by US Department of Energy, in which the filter can remove >99.97% of airborne particles that is 0.3 micrometer. The removal success rate is usually equal or higher for larger particles and for slightly smaller particles (down to ~0.01 micro), but performance drops drastically for much smaller particles. HEPA can effectively trap pollens, fine dust and smoke particles -- the major causes of allergy. \"HEPA-type\" and \"HEPA-like\" purifiers fall short of this requirement, and there is no strict guideline for their exact definitions. Historically, HEPA was a top-secret technology developed to filter radioactive aerosol, part of the Manhattan Project. HEPA is not designed to remove odors and VOC (volatile organic chemicals), since they are much smaller than the effective range of a HEPA filter. CADR (clean air delivery rate) is certified by the AHAM (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers). CADR is expressed in units of cubic feet volume per minute. The suggested floor space is usually calculated based on a 8 foot ceiling and a 5 air change setting. For example, Honeywell 50250N produces 250 cubic feet of clean air per minute or 15000 cu ft per hour. Divides 15000 cu ft by a 8 ft ceiling and by a 5 air change equates to a recommended floor space of 375 sq ft. A shortcut is to multiple the CADR number by 1.5: e.g. 250 CADR X 1.5 = 375 sq ft. Although the recommended floor space value is easier to relate to, there is no legal guideline for the calculation. Neoair's most powerful purifier, Neoair Plus, has a suggested 600 sq ft floor space, much larger than that of Honeywell 50250N. In reality, Neoair Plus has a CADR <200, meaning it is a less powerful purifier. It turns out Neoair uses a 2.5 air change per hour for the floor space calculation. Another company, Alen, uses a 2 air change per hour for their calculations. Consequently, it is more reliable to compare air purifiers based on their CADR values because it is a standardized definition.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "Let me start off by saying that I suffer from being allergic to cigarette smoke and my husband and I live in an enclosed apartment complex. This is made worse by the fact that the front door doesn't seal up against the frame and smoke from the hallway leaks into our apartment with other odors and smells. Now let me add that that my husband suffers from severe allergy's and takes medicine daily for his condition. Did I mention that we have two cats and a pug. Life was miserable in our 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment, till this little puppy showed up. It's just like the picture describes it, like a barrel, the nice feature on it is the Intellicheck, this little feature tells you when to change the filters and it's quite easy the pre filters just lay on the hepa filter and are held in place by two pieces of Velcro. They do need to be changed about ever two months though, this may be more then normal because of our pets. But since we got the first one for the living room we added one more to the bedroom. Now you walk down our hallway gagging on the scent and odors but as soon as you open our door you are greeted by the clean smelling air and the sound of the filter cleaning it. Okay it is a little loud but don't let that discourage you. Wait till you get it home and turn it on full blast. It is a little noisy but when you go up to it, you can feel it sucking in the air from all around the unit. Then the freshly cleaned air gets pushed up through the top of the unit in a circle around the unit. It really does clean the square footage it claims to.

Then a week later they wrote back to apologize, they were researching still, and it was taking longer than normal. Then I didn't hear back from them. In the meantime, I wrote them to tell them what I'd learned. I have yet to hear back. - Honeywell's website DOES NOT LIST THIS MODEL - 50250-S doesn't exist on their site.

The 50250-N he bought and described in happy supportive detail, however, is not the 50250-S you are looking at when you look at this product on Amazon for which I am writing this review.

{"review": "I have suffered from allergies all of my life, but especially the last few years, they have gotten progressively worse. Last year, I lived in an apartment over two chain smokers and was constantly congested. I started researching air purifiers because my medications weren't helping enough on their own. I ended up deciding on this unit for my living room/dining area, a Hamilton Beach 04163 for my bedroom, and another Hamilton Beach 04163 to go on the other side of my living room as well since the living room/dining area/kitchen was all together and not separated by doors and was too large an area for only one cleaner to handle efficiently. I have been very satisfied with this unit. I got it in December 2004 and it has not given me any problems. I have had to change the pre-filters a few times (you usually have to change them every three months or so) but have not yet had to change the HEPA filter. I like the way this system has what it calls Intellicheck which lets you know when it is time for the filters to be changed, as well as the way that it has the 360 degree technology. The unit looks kind of like a barrel so that the clean air flows out of the top all around it. I don't notice a cleaner air smell like I have heard people talk about, but I can definitely tell a difference in my allergy symptoms when I am running my air cleaners or not. And when I put my Hamilton Beach air cleaner in the living room which has an auto setting that detects the air quality, it had the air rated as being good from the beginning, which I believe is due to the Honeywell 50250 which had been running 24/7 a few days prior to that since the Hamilton Beach air cleaner in my room had the air quality as poor when I turned it on the auto setting. I still have to take my allergy medications that I was prescribed, but there is a definite difference between when I just take the medication and when I take the medication and use the air cleaners. I hope this review helps. I also like the fact that it has a carrying handle at the top, and I don't find it very noisy. It has a white noise to it, but I have not experienced any problems not hearing the television or not being able to nap in the living room while it is on. The replacement pre-filters are easy to find for this unit. The HEPA filter seems a little harder to find in retail stores, but it does not have to be replaced as often so it is not too bad.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I have suffered from allergies all of my life, but especially the last few years, they have gotten progressively worse. Last year, I lived in an apartment over two chain smokers and was constantly congested. I started researching air purifiers because my medications weren't helping enough on their own. I ended up deciding on this unit for my living room/dining area, a Hamilton Beach 04163 for my bedroom, and another Hamilton Beach 04163 to go on the other side of my living room as well since the living room/dining area/kitchen was all together and not separated by doors and was too large an area for only one cleaner to handle efficiently. I have been very satisfied with this unit. I got it in December 2004 and it has not given me any problems. I have had to change the pre-filters a few times (you usually have to change them every three months or so) but have not yet had to change the HEPA filter. I like the way this system has what it calls Intellicheck which lets you know when it is time for the filters to be changed, as well as the way that it has the 360 degree technology. The unit looks kind of like a barrel so that the clean air flows out of the top all around it.

{"review": "Picked it up a few weeks ago from a Home Depot. I did end up paying probably $15 more for it than if I had bought it online. That is the way I wanted it because if it didn't work well I could easily return it with no hassle and maybe pick up another one. So I have 90 days to check it out. I purchased it for my basement rec room that is 16'x30' with an 8' ceiling. So I am looking at 480 sq feet. I think the purifier is rated for 340 sq feet... So I consider that close enough. I live in the southwest where it is dusty all the time. I also have a 16 year old cat that needs a good spanking. After two weeks of using the purifier I LIKE IT A LOT. It filters the room fast and leaves you with a really clean smelling room. When I come down the stairs and turn the corner to the rec room you can smell and feel the difference right away. So up to now (two weeks) everything is great. NOW FOR THE ISSUES: My purifier does indeed wobble at low and slighly at the mid range settings. The purifier is sitting on carpet so the amount of vibration that you see is extremely small. I think it may be more of a visual problem than a real mechanical problem. If it was sitting on a wood floor it might bug me but if I liked it I would put it on a rug or get some felt or rubber pads to put under the feet. The way it is now for me is just fine. I also wonder if you could put a small piece of duct tape on one of the blades to try to offset the wobble. You can do this sort of thing with ceiling fans and it seems to work... Just a thought. The second issue is indeed the NOISE. I have read all the reviews and some people are saying that it isn't loud. To these people I say you need to go to an ear doctor (LOL). It is loud on the high setting (Trust Me). However the way I look at the noise is, That's fine with me because I know it is really pushing the air through the filter and that's what I wanted in the first place. I think very few people could stand to listen to it on the high speed setting for more than a few hours. The medium speed is just barely acceptable and I could probably get used to it if I had to. The low speed, to me, is very acceptable. How you intend to use this purifier is a big factor in whether you should buy it or not. The way I use it is like this: I bought a $5 mechanical plugin timer which has the ability to set two settings per day. I have the filter set to HIGH and the timer is set to start at 11AM-2PM (3 hours on high) and then it shuts off and starts again at 3AM-6AM (3 hours on high). The rest of the day the filter is not running. We have no bad physical conditions where we need to run it 24/7 so the six hours that we run it keeps everything fresh. Unless you need it running 24 hours a day there should be a schedule that you can come up with where the noise is really never an issue. This purifier is really cheap to operate when comparing to the more expensive makes and models - And especially if you never have to change the Hepa filter (My purifier says on box that you don't have to change it) but I will probably change it once a year or so. So, in conclusion, this Honeywell is a great purifier if you can work around the sound issue. I think the vibration issue is more a problem in your head than an actual mechanical problem. I do realize that my two weeks of operation is not a great test but if anything goes haywire I will be sure to let you guys know. Also consider buying it somewhere where you can return it if you don't like it.... Worth paying a few extra bucks I would think. Hope this helps.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "I own the Honeywell 50250 and loved it. I bought it because it was a Consumer Reports' best buy. It cleaned the air of cigarette smoke better than anything I've ever owned. But, mine quit working after 2 months. The switch gave out. It has a 5 year warranty, but according to the instructions, you have to mail the unit back, which is a huge bummer. It's not so much the fact that you have to enclose a check for $15 to get warranty service, but the fact that I'm gonna have to trudge down to the post office. I can't recommend anything that costs > $100 and quits working after 2 months. By the way, even though this is branded as a Honeywell, the manufacturer is a company called Kaz, according to the instruction manual.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "I have purchased several Honeywell air cleaners recently for my family (children, parents and brother's household) and have been very pleased with their performance and and engineering. I was looking for an air cleaner for my daughter's room and was given an older model by friends who had used it briefly before buying an Ionic Breeze instead due to the noise level- the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars. While that machine is a Sears labelled appliance, it is identical to a small Honeywell. It has effectively reduced her symptoms, and the noise hasbn't been disagreeable on lower settings with any of the machines. Using the higher settings an hour or so before bedtime and reducing the fan speed to low during the night produces a 'white nboise\" that I find soothing. Replacement filters (permanent) arte readily availabvle and economical (under $15.00 at Amazon). Other Honeywell air cleaners we have purchased differ in that they have no ionizer (not recommended by medical authorities- i am myself a family physician) and in their capacity. All of the machines I have bought are the round hassock-shaped ones and this is an imiportant design feature in that these models use either og two sizes of replacement permanent filters as above. Larger models may use up to three stacked filters in place of the original and expensive non-permanent filter. All use a cut-to charcoal-containing pre-filter which may be vacuumed periodically and used for substantially longer than the packaging indicated (at least 6 months). The HEPA filters may be vacuumed as well, a simple maintenance task. The filter that comes with a filter that is NOT permanent but is instead a \"long-life\" singlre filter with a recommended replacement interval of five years. It does not have a \"permanent filter\". one of the big pluses for these machines is the excellent 5-year warranty. No machine in this price range except a few Hunter models offer a 5-year warranty, and Hunter permanent filters are far more expensive and hard-to find. I have noted some complaints about warranty service in other reviews of Honeywell products, but nonetheless it is still a very good value. I ofund some of my machines in the local Goodwill for $10 or so- check it out!. On new machines, I really couldn't beat the Amazon deals substantially and ordered one of these and another odel for family. My brother was so impressed he went out and bought 2 other machines (regrettably, not Honeywell) for his fairly severe allergy problems. t wouldn't count on these machines to eliminate strong odors vcompletely but they do make a difference. I would add a final note about my experience with central air conditioner filters. A NMERV of 8-10 is sufficient to remove almost all common allergens. Higher filtration requires larger surface area to prevent excessive air obstruction. We bought a filter some time ago that we couldn't use for that very reason. The most economical is the Lysol brand filter available in Lowes stores. Removing bacteria from the air is unimportant- \"air sdanitizer\" are a waste of money. Airborne bacteria rarely survive long and DO NOT cause odors in and of themselves- they must be in a nutrient rich medium and actively growing to cause odors. As for mold, remember that removing moisture is the answer to that problem. A relative humidity of 40 % or less will take care of mold and mildew very nicely. So, use your AC, dehumidifier, or pipe wrench as needed to control moisture problems. As for vacuums, they all work- IF YOU USE THEM! A central system that exhausts to the outdoors or a garage area that can be aired is a great option. bagless vacuums, water trap vacuums, etc really don't make much difference in air quality. We find that using simple bedlinens in the children's rooms which can be tossed in the dryer for 10 minutes are useful ways to control dust mites and remove some of their allergens. Stuffed animal toys can also be given a spin for the same reasion. Sorry if I get carried away, but I have always felt a duty to teach my opatients to take care of themselves. I hope this has been helpful. The Honeywell air cleaners are a great way for allergy sufferers to take control of their symptoms in part.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "Ever since moving to a new home just over a year ago, my husband and I have had an increase in our allergies and sinus problems. We decided on an air purifier for the bedroom since our symptoms were worse in the mornings, and we researched air purifiers for several weeks before deciding on this one. It was the least expensive model recommended by Consumer Reports, and the most conveniently sized for our very small bedroom. As a reference, our bedroom is 14 x 15. Good points first: this baby moves a lot of air! On the high setting, you'll notice a difference in the smell and quality of air within just a few minutes. When it's on high, we can leave it in the bedroom but still tell that it's working in other rooms that are 30 feet away. This purifier really does work well at removing smells. That's my favorite part of the purifier. It also seems to help with the allergies. It hasn't cured us, but my symptoms have reduced significantly, and I credit the purifier with that. Now the not-quite-so-good: This purifier is loud. Believe what everyone says, if you have trouble getting to sleep with noise, you won't want this unit on at night. We like white noise so after just 1-2 nights, we were able to sleep just fine. On high, we can hear it through the whole house, and if it's in your living room you'll have to turn up your radio or TV to hear properly. While it's much quieter on low, it's still a bit louder than what I would choose for white noise. The blue light on the switch is pretty bright, too, and we had to cover ours so it wouldn't light up our whole room. The air it puts out is warm, so in the summers, we have to turn the a/c down to compensate since it warms up our whole bedroom. The fan is a bit off-balance, especially on low. It doesn't cause noise or affect the air output so we haven't returned the unit, but it's noticeable. The unit is kind of ugly and quite large. Before buying, I recommend deciding on where you'll put the unit and then carefully measuring a spot the size of the unit, just to see how much room it needs, especially if you have space issues like we do. All in all, the concerns I had (noise, aesthetics, size) before buying it ended up being valid, but for the price and the good it's doing, I think it's worth it. I'd give this 3.5 stars but since we can't, I'll round up to 4. Edit 8-7-07: My original review is from May 22, 2007, but I wanted to add a brief update. A few weeks ago we decided to get a second purifier for the other end of the house. This purifier is in our living room which is part of a large kitchen-dining-living room. The best thing about this second Honeywell is that it really gets rid of cooking smells quickly. The whole house smells fresher. As for allergies and sinus problems, last year at this time I'd already had 4 solid months of sinus problems. This year I've just had one episode and it was much milder than what I experienced last year. This second unit doesn't have the wobbly fan problem our first unit did. The only problems were what I mentioned before: hard to find the room for the unit, and the sound is loud enough I have to turn it off to hear the TV or radio. I'm glad we have two of these purifiers and I definitely think it's worth the 4 stars.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "This unit is amazing for yanking dust and such out of the air and making it go away. I'm not inclined to complain about the noise it makes, because the only way this thing can live up to its claim of being able to recirculate the air in a large room 6 times per hour is to move a *lot* of air, over a *large* space, and do it *fast*. Outside of a ceiling fan (which is a lot bigger) there is simply no other way to do it than with a blower that you're going to hear. One reviewer said it sounded like a floor blower (or something like that). Well, it blows at an upward diagonal, but in terms of air volume it may come close. It has to, to get the whole room to circulate back to the unit and get sucked in. Want your room's air cleaned for *real*? Grab one of these. I used a Honeywell 13500 for over 10 years before it finally died and the 50250 took its place. No regrets.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "I have other ionic air cleaners, as well as one that requires a filter. This air purifier is quiet and due to its compact size, can be placed off the floor on a bookcase, dresser top or top shelf which makes it optimal for space-saving and placement. I don't particularly like the noise from air filters and they have a tendency to keep me up. After spending many dollars on replacement filters and new air cleaners when the filter is no longer made or easily available, this is a welcome addition with a permanent cleanable filter. I bought two of these, one for my bedroom and one for the living room. Set on low all of the time, it is great as it just sounds like a little white noise and is not noticable most of the time. The optional ionic on and off switch, night light, as well as the automated light indicating that the filter should be cleaned is a BONUS besides the low price. So far, I am enjoying cleaner air in an old dusty house with 3 cats and 2 dogs... I have bought the Sharper Image ionic breeze for the bathroom and find it hard to clean and hope that when I have to clean this filter. Good value for the money.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "This is my 2nd air purifier - the other was a comparable model by Holmes. I learned from my first air purifier that you really have to leave it on all the time or the revolving motor will collect dust, not work as well or as quietly. If I don't want it on constantly, I just put a clean towel over the top to prevent any dust/dirt from building up. The noise level is acceptable to me, in an 8x10 room. I usually leave it on LOW, which sounds a bit like a fan on low speed, but MED is good too - it has a nice white noise effect. I only put it on HIGH if there's a bad smell or lots of dust floating around (for whatever reason). HIGH is a bit loud for my taste. This machine tends to rattle a bit as it sits on my bureau, but a small towel underneath it took care of that problem. Also, give it time to warm up when you put it on. It starts off slowly, but works at full speed within a few minutes. I have allergies and noticed a difference immediately when I got this model. My symptoms have improved greatly, even with 3 cats in the house. I would recommend it to anyone who has a small space, doesn't want to buy new filters and is perhaps on a budget. Good machine at a decent price.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "When I first purchased this product I was excited at the thought of filtering dust, allergens and other contaminants from the air in my room. My room tends to accumulate dust quickly so I bought the Honeywell air purifier in hopes of alleviating the problem a bit. For the first six months the purifier seemed to work very effectively. I ran it 24 hours a day nonstop as recommended (if I ever had to turn it off for any reason I covered the exhaust vent with a microfiber cloth). The fan speed was set to high when I wasn't home, medium when I was home and moving about and low when it was time to sleep. I cleaned both the outer filter and inner HEPA filter several times a week. Dust would cluster into a lint-like texture and accumulate very quickly on the outer filter, and this prevented a good amount of dust from even making it through to the inner HEPA filter. I noticed somewhat of an improvement in the air quality of my room (11.5 ft. x 8 ft.) during this time span. After about six months the air being cycled through the purifier began smelling smell strange. It's hard to describe the smell but the best way I can put it is being a \"dusty\" smell; this description would seem to make sense in this context since the purifier was now cycling air with dust covered parts and fans (explained two paragraphs down). The product listing claims that the HEPA filter never needs to be replaced, but I cannot believe this to be true. It either need to be replaced after a period of time, or it does not do the job as well as it should. The filter was white when I purchased it and is now a deep charcoal grey. Perhaps this isn't the best comparison as they are constructed of different materials, but when dealing with any other type of air filter, whether for a car, lawn mower, vacuum cleaner, etc., it needs to be replaced after a period of time because it gets dirty and loses its effectiveness. That seems to be the case with the filter for this air purifier as well. As I said mentioned earlier, I cleaned both filters regularly and did not allow dust to build up too thick of a layer. I read another customer's review mentioning that their purifier became filled with dust and grime over time, and this is exactly what happened with mine as well. As I looked through the exhaust vent I could see dust lined along the surfaces inside, both on the purifier unit itself and on the mechanical parts. I figured I'd try to blast it out with compressed air; even 185 PSI of air pressure would not move the dust and it actually looked to be turning into more of a grime as it had become caked down. After opening the purifier (held together by hex security screws) I confirmed that every internal surface was covered in caked dust. This explained the \"dusty\" smell that it was emitting. I then went through the tedious process of unscrewing and pulling a few pieces out to get better access to every surface, and I did my best to clean the dust using isopropyl alcohol. The maneuvering space is very tight and it was difficult to reach every surface, but I was able to clean the majority of the dust out. After reassembling the unit I ran it again and unfortunately the smell did not completely go away. I am unsure of whether the HEPA filter was letting contaminants get through the entire time, or whether it lost effectiveness over a period of time. The bottom line is that the purifier seemed to be working great in the beginning, but after six months it seemed to make my air quality worse. Edit (March 3, 2011): I bought another unit several months ago. When my first purifier functioned properly it worked like a charm, so I wanted to give it another go. I thought perhaps I'd have better luck if I were to clean the filters more frequently. This time I cleaned them almost every night. Sadly, and strangely, this purifier began emitting the same funny smell as my first one in an even shorter period of time. I opened up this second unit and saw a mess similar to that in my first air purifier. This time I decided to be more thorough with my alcohol wipe down. I removed every single internal component and completely dissected them to get almost 100% of the dust cleaned out. Unfortunately I was left with the same result as the first time around and the purifier continued to emit the same funny smell. Edit (July 7, 2013): I've cleaned up and rewrote most of my review for readability and to add more details on my remembered experience with the product. I also wanted to note that I purchased the Hamilton Beach 04383 air purifier in October of 2012 and it has worked great for me. Many people seem to have great experiences with this Honeywell air purifier, but I just cannot recommend it at all. I initially had my rating at three stars since the first unit I purchased did give me a good six months of filtered air. However, I just dropped my rating to one star as my issues with the product are completely unacceptable. It is disappointing to have gone beyond the recommended cleaning parameters for the filters and to have completely cleaned out the insides of the units, only to have them both crap out on me.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I just returned this item and amazon took $12 off for restocking fee. So I decided to write a review now to share my experience. The unit is small, which is good because I could put it on a table. One small thing that annoyed me was that the unit actually moved little by little when it was on because it was vibrating. So I had to put it on a more rugged surface to keep it from moving. The purifier worked perfectly fine for the first several days. It produced a humming sound, and it wasn't loud. I could definitely have it turned on while reading without being distracted. The high setting was quite noisy, but still it was within reasonable range of noise. Bottom line: if it were like that all the time, I would've kept it. Unfortunately, after several days, the unit became extremely noisy and produced a noise like popping popcorn in a microwave, even when I set it only on low. Then the noise became intolerable and I decided to return the item. Perhaps it was because I got a defective unit or what, I don't know. But before buying it, I read some reviews on amazon indicating that the unit is indeed very noisy. Some reviews, however, suggested otherwise, that the product is excellent. Given the mixed reviews, probably the risk of getting a very noisy purifier like mine is not extremely small. Hope this is helpful.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I brought this one recently to replace the sharper image's ionizer purifier, since I want something to shut off the ionizer -- the air has some smell from those ions. This unit has three speeds. Another switch to turn on or off the ionizer. The lowest speed can push enough air comparable to Sharper Image's high speed, without much noise. If no one talks in the room, you can still notice the sound. But if anyone talks or the TV is on, then you would not noticed the sound, even in a 8x10 room. Middle and high speed push 20-50 times more air than a Sharper Images ionizer purifiers. I wish it has a feature to push a button to boost the air flow to high speed for 15 minutes, then fall back to slowest speed...

{"review": "I bought the Honeywell HHT-011 through Amazon.com. At first all was well and I was very pleased with the air quality produced by the Air Purifier. I'm currently deployed as a U.S. Army Soldier in Iraq and the air outside is normally filled with dust, dirt, and smoke from Iraqis burning stuff. I live in a Containerized Housing Unit (CHU) and bought the Honeywell HHT-011 for my 12' X 8' room room. I tend to have sinus issues when the air quality is poor. The fan was a little loud, but tolerable - I just had to crank up the TV or IPOD. The front grill did not fit snuggly on the unit and reflects on how the unit is cheaply made. However after about one month of use, the Honeywell HEPA Clean started to get louder and louder. It appears that the fan wheels are off center and have created a rattling noise. Now the Air Purifier is much louder and rumbles, rattles, and rolls. I've cleaned the filters (pre-filter and HEPA Filter) and the noise persists. This purchase was very disappointing since it's a quality of life issue. But, you get what you pay for. Reading other similar reviews, this sounds like a quality control issue with Honeywell. Be prepared to spend more for a quality unit. Thanks.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "This Honeywell HHT-011 tabletop air purifier turned out to be just what I needed. It sits on a dresser in the bedroom. It is very stable, does NOT shake or vibrate, but produces a kind of \"white noise\" that is amazingly conducive to sleep (you can barely hear it on the lowest of the three speeds)we keep it on the medium speed. The air is cleaner, we no longer sneeze upon waking, and I don't need to dust as often. One of my main reasons for buying this product was that it has a permanent HEPA filter which can be cleaned and reused. (Our PREVIOUS air purifier was large-taking up too much floor space, it was too noisy, it was an electricity hog, and you needed to buy a new replacement filter as necessary - costing way too much to run.) THIS PRODUCT is compact, powerful enough to keep the room fresh and clean, easy and not expensive to maintain.

{"review": "I bought this unit to help clean the air of my bedroon which is in the habit of getting too dirty of small dirt, organic and moth particles brought by one's cloth with everyday use and cleaning (small, tiny particles of our clothes do tend to come away by normal wear). This unit is cheap and is barely able to do the cleaning of a REALLY SMALL sized room. In over a year of having this unit cleaning the air in a daily basis, I've noticed that the air flux coming out of one of the openings of the unit was getting smaller and smaller (and eventually the unit was acting if as it was sucking the air in from one of the exhausts), until one day, the unit stopped working. Either the fans where misplaced from the fabric as one of them (there are two) seemed to suck the air as opposed to throw it away, or the motor was dead: all the unit did was a buzzing noise when turned on and the fans stopped rotating. I thought either a replacement motor or a correct placement of one of the rotors was due, and I didn't want to buy another unit for a year's service only.I tried to open it myself but soon found out that there where strange screws I couldn't work on, so I took it to a home appliance technician to take a closer look... when we opened the unit the problem was obvious: there where TONS of dirt accumulated over all the interior! dirt... moth.. you name it, everything was there. No motor replacement needed, no changing the fan's rotors... the fix: to clean and re-lube all the interior. The dirt accumulatted over a year to efectively stalled the motor and prevent it from rotating the fans. How did all the dirt ended in there? It is supposed to clean the air after passing the 2 filters and before reaching the inside! The fact is this unit is so cheaply designed that it has small openings all around it, efectivelly letting dirty air inside in a way it was not intended to. THE FIX: a) If your unit is old (6-12 months), clean it first from all the dirt on the inside (depending of how dirty your air is) 1) Remove the plastic grid that holds the 1st filter. 2) remove the 2nd (HEPA) filter 3) I used kids plasticine to seal the openings all around the exterior of the base of the HEPA (2nd) filter: this is where 2 separate moldings \"snap\" together, but leaving lines of \"openings\" that let air pass unchecked. 4) Return the filters and the grid 5) Use any kind of adhesive-tape (masking tape would be good) to seal the \"line-opening\" that goes all around the exterior of the unit from the \"right\" side of the grid all the way to the \"left\" side of the grid. This line is the snap juncture between the base of the unit and the molded top where the controls are. In this way, MOST of the air will now have to pass thru BOTH filters and the air leacking to the inside would be minimized. Happy air.", "id": "267554011"}

I am sure there could be other reasons for this but let me assure you that a robust immune system is not one of them! :) Some people complain about these units.. saying there is low airflow through them. I'll let you in on a little secret.. it takes some time in contact with light to kill germs in the air. If the air moved too fast the germs would not have enough contact time with the light to die. Put the unit in an area where the air moves around it. Perhaps near a door or in a room with a ceiling fan that normally runs. If you put it in the corner of a room with dead air.. its going to purify the heck out of that corner.. :) I placed the unit on a kill-a-watt meter tonight and it registered a constant draw of 9 watts. Thats pretty great as far as air purifiers are concerned. I have electronics that draw more than that when they are off.

{"review": "I've owned several Holmes air purifiers over the last ten years and I've been very happy with their performance. There is nothing wrong with the function of these HEPA filters, they work great. The only reason why I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5, is due to the change in the support clips on the filters themselves. Before this shipment of HEPA filters (I installed seven new HEPA filters this weekend), the support clips used to fit snugly on the supports inside the filter. The support clips need to be snug so that the filters don't fall off before you close the door or when you open the door. Some of the HEPA filters are installed horizontally, which means that they aren't even going to remain on due to gravity if there is nothing to hang on to, the vertically installed ones will stay unless you touch the unit or someone walks by it. I have three purifiers right now, two of which take two HEPA filters (both installed horizontally) and one of which takes three (one installed horizontally, two vertically). The new looser supports now means the HEPA filters fall out unless held in place or the unit is tilted backwards (which I'm not sure is something you should do with these units). The carbon prefilters need to be replaced every 3-4 months, but need to be vacuumed out more often if you have a lot of dust or a pet.

At $10 or so every month, that starts to add up. The one I had in the closet never made a dent either. My main concern was obviously the mouse smell, which has kept me and my clothes out of there for too long. It had been so bad at one point that it saturated my books, clothes and even my suitcases, which I couldn't even use for my trip. There was also this humid feeling and a musty kind of smell that was new, although that might have been more residual Mickey. I tried everything, from sprays (Zero Odor/air fresheners, etc.) and my usual Febreze air filters. I also attempted to carpet clean in there with my Rug Doctor, and even whipped out my handy dandy steam cleaner, both of which typically kick Odor's butt on a good day. Nothing worked until I tried these charcoal bags. Whodda thunk? I purchased a large bag and a small one, just to try things out. I stuck the large one in the closet and shut the door. I figured that, worse case, it might reduce the Mickey smell to a somewhat tolerable, non-gag-inducing stench, but they actually went beyond my expectations. I noticed a small yet noticeable improvement within the first 24 hours, and every day I'd start sniffing out dramatic results. It had actually turned into a mini game of mine, almost like Christmas. By Day 3, the dead rodent smell was gone from the closet, with only small traces of whatever musty, humid odor I kept smelling, which was nearly gone as well. I was thrilled. I recharged the bags again and stuck both in there just to see if it would speed things up and it really seemed to do the trick. The smell was pretty much gone by Day 5 and is now really gone today on Day 7. I'm thrilled and can now leave my closet door open without gagging to death--something I haven't been able to do for a very long time. Around Day 5 or so, I did take the small bag out and left the large one in the closet--though I wound up switching them around the following day. Obviously the little bag worked on its own to some degree; I'm just impatient. The big one works great in the litter box/bathroom area as well, and I do believe that it's working with the rest of the master bedroom (open concept configuration). The small one worked for the litter if placed right next to it too; I just wanted to use the big one for the rest of the area. I'm already raving about it to my friends and family, and I definitely plan to order some more as soon as I can afford it for the rest of the house. Since it's a pretty large, open-concept rental (2200sqft.), I'm guessing I'll have to get quite a few which is the only downside. I love that they're easily recharged in the sun and good for two years--though I'm not sure if recharging it more often reduces their longevity or not. Hopefully, with enough of the bags littered around the house, I won't feel like I need to steam or carpet clean so much just to reduce house smells, which is somewhat of a phobia of mine. I also feel that these do reduce humidity to some degree, which is also great. I can't tell whether it's doing anything with allergens and what not (am still sneezing, etc.), but that's not a huge deal. Plus, it's that time of year anyway. I'm also happy to report that I no longer have to run my fan filter or the bathroom fan to keep the kitty ozone layer from creeping into the bedroom, which is great. Both tend to be on the loud side, not to mention waste electricity. ETA: Still liking the bags over a month later. Mickey smell is still gone, even during a heat spell, and I've not had the bags in there for several weeks. I just put it in my partner's man cave a few days, which wreaks of man and beer ha, and while it's not completely gone yet, I can't smell it from the hallway anymore with the door shut. Yay! I actually forgot about it until noticing the lack of stench while coming home, which is when I often notice it. Even he noticed and hadn't known I put it in there. I also wanted to add, since I noticed some complaints on this, that this this isn't a cure-all. It's not going to immediately zap the last-minute, heavy-duty smells if you burn dinner or a sneaky cigarette, or if kitty decides to leave a smellier-than-usual surprise that could peel paint off a wall; it's better for residual house smells. One bag is also not going to cure the entire house/apartment--make sure to read the square footage description. If I run into the immediate stench situation, I use products like Zero Odor which seem good for that--though I like this way more for its effectiveness, and it's by far cheaper, more convenient, and best for long-term smells.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "I moved into a rental within the last month that smelled just awful!! Curry and armpit is the best I can describe it as. I poured over the internet looking for ways to rid Curry smell and found that I was not alone! We had the duct system cleaned, carpets cleaned, walls painted, all the appliances were pulled out and cleaned. I used ammonia, de-greaser, you name it and we did it. The smell was out of the majority of the house, with the exception of the kitchen. It was most strongly around the oven and the sink. When you walked in the house, you would notice an odor. I bought a Moso bag, not really believing it would work, but thinking it can't make the smell worse. I WAS WRONG. I have had it on top of the stove for three days and each day I walked in the house after work and I DID NOT NOTICE the smell!! The oven area is smelling less and now I will move it by the sink. I would recommend this to anyone with Curry issues or people working on garbage (hoarder) houses!!", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "Bamboo charcoal is not only a deodoriser, it also functions similar to an ioniser. In China and Japan, they have charcoal embedded pillows. Also for car seats, cause it has an energising effect. I wanted to test this for sleeping purposes so I bought the 200 gram packet and placed it under my pillow. It has been a month now, and I can say that I sleep the best in a long time. To go to sleep at pm, and wake up at am, with eyes wide awake as has happened once or twice is a first for me for many years. It has greatly improved the depth of my sleep. So if you have trouble sleeping, or want to induce a deeper sleep, give this a try. After this experience I will buy myself a charcoal embedded pillow. Hard to find but obtainable ex China and ex Japan. To add to this review, I noticed that the effect of the charcoal to cause deep sleep did diminish over a month. I thought that maybe my system had adjusted to it. Well, that was incorrect. The first time I recharged it in the sunshine for a few hours, the full effect returned. Because its used as pillow underlay it was easy to notice the recharge effect. The charged charcoal has an energy effect causes a sort of enhanced vibration. So my comment to those people who say these bags do not work very well as deodorisers, is that they are probably using discharged bags. From my experience, if one wants a fully charged bag, it should be recharged in the sun at least once a month. To make a third addition to this review, I noticed that when I placed the bag on the top shelf in one cleaning cupboard having two shelves, against which the door closed with only a small gap between the shelves, that it cleared the odor of the bottom area, which was quite malodorous. So this shows that the carbon is setting up its own circulation quite independent of air circulation. The carbon is a negative charge and somehow it attracts the smell and decay which is positively charged and bonds to them (adsorbing) and thus neutralises the smell. It all happens invisibly, but it happens.", "id": "267554011"}
{"review": "This is worth reading. Especially if you are stuck living in Florida. I found these at Marshall's and bought a couple 200mg bags to put in the living room. The place is musty no matter what I bleach and Lysol and duct clean. Not to mention in Florida it's hot and who knows what else is living in the air in this house. Anyway, I didn't expect these things to do squat. But since they were discounted at Marshall's I would try it. You know when you go out for a while and your air conditioner isn't cranking at 65 degrees because that's expensive just to keep that basement smell down and you walk back in and search for \"that smell\" (heaven forbid you bring a guest)? Well, I almost had a heart attack when I walked back in the door after a particularly hot January day (I'm serious, Florida is the worst) and I didn't have to check the house for runaway nursing home residents hiding in one of my closets. That's what the house's (it's old) natural smell is: nursing home. More of on the nursing home antique furniture the residents own and the mothballs they insist on side and less on the pee side(One point for me! No pee smell). ANYWAY, I ordered 6 more of these things and put two by the air handler where it sucks up air and breeds new forms of life as a part-time job when it isn't being busy blasting what it likes to think of as cold air through the house. Oh. My. Golly. Now I can bring people over without having to be home first to Febreeze the heck out of my curtains. I swear it smelled like I was hoarding cat hair in bags or something without owning a cat. My husband now thinks I have won the war on odd, lingering cooking smells. I am a hero from buying these bamboo sacks of magic. I hope this was helpful in two respects: 1.) Never buy an older house just because it's \"charming\". Go with that hardwood and stainless steel and out of the factory smell. 2.) If you do have those God-forsaken smells that never go away and you wonder how the heck your neighbor's house always smells like a fresh pile of laundry, it's because they either have these Moso things or they are Febreezing the hell out of their house before you stop by.", "id": "267554011"}

{"review": "first let me say that i have a tiny 420 sq ft apartment w 3 rooms, and my biggest concern was the safety of my pet birds which can not tolerate any sprays or chemicals in the air, the reviews and my desire for a natural alternative that would not cover up smells pushed me to give this a try despite my thinking \"what can a little bean bag looking thing possibly do?\" 1st i tried this under my bathroom sink (a big musty smell test in a 120 yr old house during a very humid summer)and YES it worked. later i tried it in my living room on what i consider the MEGA TEST! something smelled like it had died! the smell was horrific so i used (2) 200mg bags, charged them first for one hour & in less than 24 hrs the smell was almost gone, but i was still hunting for the dead thing which turned out to be a bat that died in my ac unit! after removing the poor little critter & nearly passing out from the smell i put a bag next to the smelly ac unit and IN 6 HRS THE SMELL WAS GONE! despite my tiny apartment the 3 rooms call for more bags, i would say ideal for me would be one 500gm bag for my living room, and the (2) 200mg bags to swap to other rooms when needed. and really in this house you never know what you will find after a live squirrel popped up in march under my bathroom sink, luckily he made his way out and did not die in a wall!!! If you are sensitive to smells like i am and want a natural and safe alternative for your family and pets this is a great choice, i imagine in a car they would work wonders but my car never smells bad so i can not test it (yet) Pros- they work!!!!! and it really does work to \"charge\" them in the sun which just amazes me.

This bag is incredible and for $10 you get 2 years of use. Not to mention it's a completely natural solution. 1 bag takes care of my entire entryway and because of how small it is it's no where near a burden to look at.

{"review": "Everyone, My wife bought me this kegerator for a birthday present and I was super excited. I ordered a keg of Stone IPA, and after some searching, I found a local place that exchanges 5 lbs beverage-quality CO2 canisters. I went ahead and swapped the empty that came with this setup for one of their exchange canisters because in the end, I think it will make my life easier not having to worry about refilling it. I put it all together, let everything chill down inside the fridge to the coldest setting of 7 (this is important because the CO2 loses pressure when it gets cold). When I went to pour the beer, it was super foamy. I thought it was just the new keg so I let it sit for another day, and I tried it again only to end up with the same result. I wasn't sure what to do, so I did some research and found that for my elevation, my regulator was out-of-the-box set to 25 PSI - way too high. I found a PSI kegerator chart, and realized that I needed to be at a much, much lower PSI of around 5. I got a wrench and twisted the +/- nob on the regulator until I got it down to 5 PSI and that solved the foam problem - I did not need a new hose like some of the reviews stated. My next issue. Once I adjusted the pressure the pour was fine, but I noticed the beer had a really strong plastic/rubber/metallic/chemical smell/taste. I did more research and convinced myself I had oxidized my beer by having it exposed to too much CO2 PSI - this later turned out to be false and I learned that beer can easily withstand up to 30 PSI without being ruined. I was ready to call it a wasted-keg-day, but out of denial I continued to do research on the problem. Finally, I found an article on a beer brewing forum that talked about how the synthetic washer between the keg and the tap hose could be to blame. I disconnected the keg from the hose that connects it to the pourer, and I could smell the problem at once. There is this white ring/washer/gasket thing that comes with this kegerator that is known to give the beer this horrible taste/smell as it passes over it and/or sits in the tube, and it reeked of that chemical smell. I truly did not know one little washer could stink and foul up beer so badly, but it sure can. My fingers still smelled like that chemical a day after I washed them, and I have a terrible sense of smell. I yanked that thing out, replaced it with a rubber o-ring, and the problem was 90% solved. I ordered a keg cleaning kit to flush the remainder of the smell out of the tap tube, and a set of black synthetic washers that has been reported not to have that problem. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is because of the research I had to do, and the emotional toll it took on me thinking I ruined 5 gallons of expensive beer. I can tell you right now with 100% honesty that I am enjoying a beer, straight from my keg, and it is delicious. This thing is going to turn me into a beer snob for sure. I emailed the people at Smart+ and hopefully soon they will stop shipping those bad-news white washers. Make sure you adjust your regulator, make sure you don't use one of those white washers, and you will love this thing. -R", "id": "2686378011"}

Everyone seems to prefer draft beers and I prefer a few cups versus a ton of cans for clean up so I gave this a try and am pleased with the performance.

It is also a nice looking unit and my wife doesn't mind me leaving it in view since it is stainless steel. It is a good unit and I would recommend it highly.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "This kegerator is currently top dog on the market for light usage residential kegerators and at $500 primed I decided to give it a try since it has always been on my mind, having frosty cold tap-fresh beer in my home.. so I went for it! the packaging is very good, it comes with everything you need to set it up EXCEPT for the casters being bolted to the main unit. this requires a 10mm 6 point socket or box wrench. not at all a big deal, but to get them good and tight, its necessary. Once unpackaged and set up, we found out that the included CO2 tank was the biggest headache of the whole product, by a mile. The tank is a 2.5lb (NOT A 5LB) CO2 tank. good quality, but Chinese made aluminum cylinder, HOWEVER, this cylinder is rated at 2,160PSi... and the valve is rated at a mere 3,000PSI. This is OK in China, where the tank is made but it is not OK in the US where this product is sold because the working pressure of the valve must be 5/3 of the working cylinder pressure, which works out to a 3,360PSI valve. I had the valve changed at a local gas supply chain for $15. all is now well. and its working well but something to think about since anyone worried about their license will not fill the tank with the valve that comes on it. On to the kegerator itself *the compressor is quiet, the stainless was well protected and looks good. the upper tap housing feels solid and accepts a standard *screw-on tap handle which is nice for personalization. *the door is flat, not bowed, even with a half barrel, which I like just for aesthetics reasons. some competitors have convex doors. *the whole thing is on four decent quality casters, very easy to move around on flat floors. *the kegerator comes with a rubber holding strap that keeps the CO2 bottle out of the way inside the unit, holds 2.5 or 5lb tanks with ease. *included regulator is cheap but works well. shows gas bottle pressure and working flow, including a 'low gas' zone in red. *a notched base inside the kegerator that slots the kegs right in for stable storage. *temerature! this thing gets the beer REALLY cold on the lowest setting. I have it cranked to the max '7' and beer is a frosty 21 degrees out of the tap. Cons: *Chinese tank is not fillable at a reputable gas company due to under-rated CO2 valve *no wrench included to install casters tightly (At least on mine) over all, it is a VERY good unit and I would recommend to a friend.", "id": "2686378011"}

I've always prefered draft beer when out at a bar or resteraunt but didn't think it was realistic at home until a few months ago. My wife and I converted our \"formal\" living room to a game room, complete with pool table, pinball and various other games. Once we had everything set up my wife (I'm so glad I married her) suggested I get a kegorater to complete the room! I was a bit skeptical at first but why not, already got approval from the boss! The Smart+ came a week or so later w/o incident. Setting it up was pretty easy, the instructions could have been better but really not much of a problem. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is there was a small issue with the temperature control, it wouldn't stay cold enough. I contacted customer support and was pleasantly surprised at how attentive they were. The rep I talked to, Steve, walked me through a very simple adjustment, took about three minutes, which worked like a charm. He even gave me his personal cell phone number and encouraged me to contact him if I had any other problems! Much to my surprise he followed up with me a few weeks later to make sure all was well!

Easy opening lid top that stays in place is also a big plus. Nothing worse than trying to hold a lid open and retrieve your food from a chest one-handed. Or getting bopped in the back of the head while reaching in with both hands. The adjustable temp dial on the front of the freezer makes it a lot easier to choose the settings of cold that we like.

{"review": "I've read the other reviews on this unit, and I still picked one up. This isn't a book/batteries/small retail, and when buying it from Amazon, you should really be present at delivery to insure no damage befell your unit in shipping. I was home when this came, and I looked over the box before I let the UPS driver go. It came double boxed with quite a bit of foam and cardboard protecting the fridge, then more cardboard protecting the tower/bottle/regulator/etc inside. After attaching the casters and fully assembling the unit, I waited the recommended 8 hours (really, I waited overnight) before plugging it in. I let it run for another night to be sure it was cooling properly, and then - after I decided everything was fine, I filled the CO2 bottle and purchased my keg. Don't omit this series of steps. If you want a working kegorator, pay attention to the instructions that come with it. It's pretty simple. ***UPDATE*** More than a year later, this kegorator is still going strong. I did have to replace the gas bottle it came with on the 2nd fill, which was pretty disappointing, but with that exception it's still working perfectly. ***UPDATE 3/15/14*** This little Kegorator is still plugging right along. It's survived 2 moves, countless re-jiggerings (ball lock, Sankey D, U-International) multiple faucets (stout, perlick, standard) and 2 gas systems (nitro and co2) I've moved on, but this little guy will be finding himself a new home, still running as well as the day he came to mine. Officially he can fit a 1/2bbl of most of the major brands (no banded kegs), he can also fit some of the weird euro stuff (Guinness is always a favorite) or he can fit 2 5-gallon cornies or torpedo kegs (1/6bbl commercial). Things to watch for - The tower likes to loosen up after a bit of time and has a bit of side to side play while pouring. This was pretty easily fixed with a sheet of rubber gasket material, cutting a washer to tighten up the fit.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I was hesitant about purchasing this kegerator because of some of the reviews but decided to buy it anyway. The unit came in scratch and dent free which I was very pleased about. I spent the extra bucks and got the stainless model which looks nice in the man cave. I was a little surprised how small the unit was when I was unpacking it. In the pictures they all look the same but this is not a full size kegerator it is basically a mini-fridge with an over sized door to accomodate a full size keg. This was not an issue for me because I am limited on space and the overall cosmetic appearance of the unit is very nice. I installed the casters to give it more height. The kegerator assembled easily and came with alot of spare gaskets, parts and wrenches which I thought was cool. Do pay attention to the gasket that belongs beneath the tower like the other reviews say because it is not mentioned in the instructions. It comes with a 2.5 pound Co2 tank which is adequate but I will probaly upgrade to a 5 pound. It also came with a nice dual gauge Co2 regulator unlike some reviews said. Some of the reviews said the unit would not get cold enough. Mine seems to stay around 34-36 degrees on the max setting. That seems perfect to me! Some of the reviews talk about the noise. I can say it is a little noisy but just a little more than a regular refrigerator. You get what you pay for in life and this unit has some cheaply made parts here and there but at the end of the day what do you expect from a kegerator? Cold draft beer when you want it and this unit will deliver! Why pay hundreds more? I am very pleased so far.

Kegs are big so you can't expect it to be cold after a few hours. Read the directions! Let the kegorator chill for a day without the keg and another day with the keg. The foam took a little time to regulate, but we are rookies. We got the balance after a few days. There is no noticeable noise. If the house is quiet, of course you can hear it. Its a refrigerator!

Put in the keg and attached the tap. OK. I should be good. Beer was extremely foamy. Waited overnight and checked the following evening and beer was slightly cool. Certainly not cold and still extremely foamy. I went out and got a refrigerator thermometer and saw that the temp could not get below 44 degrees even on max setting. After 3 days my CO2 tank was empty. Checked for leaks with Mr Bubble and there were leaks throughout the different components of the lines.

{"review": "I bought this product about 3 months ago for my office at work. Great unit, we've already put 3 or 4 kegs through it, the instructions are easy to follow just make sure you read them twice. It always serves up cold beer (or cider) perfectly carbonated - as long as it's setup properly. I am lucky to work with several people who are kegerator guru's who assisted me, but in essence make sure you do some reading around the correct pressure to use in the keg (depending on type of beer) and make sure you keep it cold. Just bear in mind, with any kegerator you can't simply plug and go, you need to let the gas build up a 'head' to carbonate your drink. We do have a kegerator at work which is a different model to this one, but has identical internals, it doesn't work properly.. why.. the person putting it together didn't read the instructions properly ;) Don't worry about the Gas bottle being cheaply made - most places do exchanges anyway, so you'll never see it again after delivery.

{"review": "Bottom line: this does what it says it will do and is decent quality. If you're looking here you most likely have a kegerator and have experienced some foaming issues. Cooling the tower is a great way to help that if the rest of your system is balanced (line length, PSI, temperature). It comes with all required components and some easy to follow instructions. You don't need to be mechanically inclined to install as it is super easy to install and hook up. I was able to snake the power wire in the top next to the refrigeration line on my Sanyo BC-1206 after I moved some of the plumber's putty out of the way. The only other thing is to run the hose up into the cooler. It worked quickly and my tower went from being room temperature to cool and forming condensation very quickly. Yes, you can build your own cheaper if you have an extra fan laying around. I didn't, and didn't want to piece together something. This fit my needs at a reasonable price.

{"review": "This thing does what is says. Sure, you could build your own and save yourself a few bucks. But then how much is your time worth? This comes complete and ready to use. My only real problem with this is that the power cord is short and there is no way to easily extend it. Putting this inside a Kegerator means that you need to either 1. Run the power wire up by the side of it and have the door close on it (possibly making the seal not perfect, but It seems to work fine in my case) or 2. If you have your CO2 bottle inside the kegerator, you can use the hole in the back to run the power through. It is simply not possible to run an air line AND this power cable at the same time through the opening. But in either solution, the power cable is too short and the on/off switch is by the wall wart transformer end of the cable which means you need to just leave it on. While you would normally do this during operation of the unit anyway, it makes troubleshooting noises or re-configuring/moving things around less than ideal. I am happy with the purchase and it does help. I just wish there were more options regarding the power supply.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "Works fairly well in cooling the tower of my kegerator. Previously, I was forced to run about 4 oz. of beer off with each fresh pour because the temperature in the tower wasn't keeping the beer cold enough and I would get glasses of half foam. This seems to be very common with low end kegerators. I read lots of forums and did lots of tweaking to the temperature/pressure/lines/etc., but didn't have any notable success in reducing the foam on each new pour. After installing this product, I got better pours but still had a bit foam at the start (probably a 50-75% improvement). I went to my local big box hardware store and got some pipe insulation, which wrapped around the outside of the tower to keep the cold in. Now I'm getting perfect pours every time and not wasting any beer. This is definitely a recommended product for those frustrated with foamy keg beer and adding in some insulation will help if this product doesn't do the trick by itself.

{"review": "The Keggermeister Kegerator comes packaged in double \"double walled\" boxes with a lot of Styrofoam packaging materials and materials. All of the minor components are neatly organized in a separate box inside of the Kegerator fridge. After removing all the pieces and laying them out, I began to read the instruction manual. The manual content is very clear and concise with well illustrated pictures on the assembly of the unit and pieces. The box was undamaged in shipping Assembly is fairly simple, anyone with basic knowledge of hand tools should have no problem. It takes about 20-30 minutes to get it put together and running, the one thing I would advise any owner is to take your time and learn the pieces of the dispensing system while you assemble it. This is critical in understanding how everything works in order to be able to trouble shoot any issues should they arise. The unit comes with a 2.5lb C02 tank that I was able to get filled up for less than ten bucks. I recommend a local paint ball shop since they are better equipped to fill this size of tanks up. Welding supply shops also work. Once everything is assembled and it was plugged in it turned right on and gave a silent hum as if to let me know it was on. Even with the compressor cycling on and off it still maintains a very minimal noise level. After allowing the refrigerator to operate with no keg in it for 24 hours I decided to give it a test drive. The first keg used was a Full Keg of Budlight. After letting the Keg sit and cool in the Kegerator for another 24 hours it was time for the first pour which resulted in nothing but foam. After doing a bit of trouble shooting I realized I had opened the valve on the C02 tank all the way for max flow. This resulted in over pressurizing the keg. To fix this I closed the valve and adjusted the regulator to having it near closed. I then pulled the pressure release pin on the coupler releasing the built up C02 in the keg. The next glass I poured came out perfectly - pure golden bliss with a decent layer of foam. About 40 minutes layer I tried to fill up a pitcher of beer and was presented with a near perfect pour. This was more than enough of evidence that there was a consistent pressure and was at an optimal level for consistent pouring. The exterior has a nice black matte finished that goes well with any décor. The chrome guardrail and stainless steel spout add a nice touch to the overall exterior of the unit. Cleanup is easy and was simple with just a bit of standard surface cleaner. I was also able to change out the tap handle with a standard Brewing Company handle.

{"review": "I would give this zero stars if possible, this kegerator doesn't get below 40 degrees even on the max setting. My first keg i bought was a five gallon keg, half of it was easily wasted because of foam, then a few days later out of the blue i start getting perfect pours. I didn't adjust ANYTHING i had a glass of water at the bottom of the kegerator with a thermometer in it and it was still at 40 degrees, so i know that the temp inside didnt change. the psi was the same as well (according to the regulator that comes with the unit)So when i finished my first keg i bought my second one, waited 24 hours before using it and still got 100% foam, i have adjusted the co2 pressure numerous times, i cleaned the lines before i put my second keg in, yet the best pour i ever got was about 2/3s foam. The faucet on the tower is now loose as well and falling out of the tower. The keg coupler also leaks CO2 out of the pressure relief valve, causing my CO2 tank to last about a 1/3 as long as it should. There is nothing good i can say about this kegerator. Also when it first arrived the fridge door fell off, and the vinyl part on top of the kegerator hung down so low that it would prevent the door from closing, I had to stick pieces of cardboard under it so that the door could shut! This is just a kegerator with inferior parts. Waste of my money, I am now going to have to pay to replace the tower, faucet, lines, regulator, and buy an external temperature control that will override the kegerators thermostat so that the unit can get cold enough. I couldn't regret this purchase more.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "My wife gave me the money to buy a keggerrator. Glad to find 1 at half the price. So glad I bought 2.

{"review": "This product works great for me. No issues with foam or too hot or too cold. I spent the extra money to buy a different C02 regulator($50) due to previous problems with factory stock regulators leaking. But for the price this kegerator cant be beat. And Im sure there are more reasoning to previous reviews other than product deficiency. A refrigerator doesnt make a keg serve 100% foam haha. I could tap a keg in the middle of the summer and adjust the C02 regulator and I would pour beer without foam. So yes your beer might not have been 34 degrees when you poured it but that also shows the previous reviewer cant work a regulator. So other than all that this is a great product for any at home bar or back yard grill.", "id": "2686378011"}

{"review": "When the kegerator arrived I couldn't wait to get started. Once I had the keg and co2 bottle, I hooked everything up and could not get anything but foam. I tried everything possible from reading online forums and got nothing. Just when I was ready to ship it back, I talked to a guy who had one and he set me straight and i decided to give it one more try. I let the keg sit and burped the co2 out of it for a few days. Then started over. I set the co2 pressure at 4psi and got my first glass of draft!! It poured a bit slow, so I tinkered with the settings and can't really go over 5psi. Now it is working awesome and I have no complaints. The instructions are very vague with pressure and troubleshooting but once I got things right, I could not be happier.", "id": "2686378011"}

Well, first off it came a week before expected, which was perfect. Then the packaging was very simple and organized (double padded boxes) and the package itself unharmed. I read the instructions and literally had the machine running and set up in an hour. And im not good with things like this at all, far from a handyman. While it was cooling, i drove down the street and filled the CO2 tank for less than $10. 3-4 hours later i had ice cold draft beer in a very appealing kegerator. Had some friends over and they fell in love with it as well. One of the best investments i have pursued. Definitely 5 starts, and on top of all that it also came with an extra O ring and seals for each part so any upcoming maintenance needed should be cake.", "id": "2686378011"}

He thought he would just plug it in, hook up the kegs and pour. As was noted in other posts, he did have a problem with the kegerator only getting down to 40 degrees, he contacted EdgeStar and they gave him the instructions over the phone on how to make that adjustment and now he is a very happy husband, pouring great beer and I'm expecting my wife of the year award to arrive any day now.", "id": "2686378011"}

{"review": "When I first started this appliance, I thought \"this is a 5 star\". It looks good. It is quiet, It gets to temperature quickly. I was initially very satisfied. Then, when the temperature stabilized after several days, I realized it was not cold enough for beer. It settled out at 46 degrees, measured with a liquid temperature monitor submerged in water. So, I looked around and found that this is pretty normal. Many people reported that they had to adjust the thermostat. The procedure for doing this was on line, in several places, and there was even an Edgestar youtube video showing the procedure. Since I worked as an electronics technician for about 20 years and had made thousands of very delicate adjustments on instrumentation control equipment, I was not intimidated. I performed the procedure. In the video, the tech warns \"we do not want to adjust this control more that once, since it will completely lose its calibration\". Sounded strange to me, but, I decided, we'll be careful. I did the adjustment, plugged the machine in and the internal temperature dove to 32 degrees and completely iced up the back plate. So, I let the ice melt, and did the one extra turn that the tech on the video said we could make. Plugged it in and, again, it dropped and iced up. So, I guess it can lose its calibration on one adjustment. I went to the Edgestar support page and found that I could leave an email with a question. So, I did that, asking only how I could buy a replacement thermostat since it didn't look like there was much of a warranty option on this thing and others had said that Edgestar took forever and a lot of hassle to get a replacement under any kind of warrant . Got an auto reply that said \"call this number\". From reading other posts, I learned that the people who had called the number basically just got the procedure. Before asking my questions, I had looked at the warranty and learned that if you do have a problem and need a \"service call\", you have to send the appliance back to an authorized location, paying shipping both ways. Since I was only talking about a very flimsy 2.00 thermostat, I decided to just do a workaround and replace the factory thermostat with an add on Johnson controller. Other than the thermostat issue, I can tell you that this seems to be a very good refrigerator that will freeze the heck out of anything, if that's what you want to do.

The idea that we could have our normal, domestic Light beer and then a rotating IPA tap was just what I wanted. The point of getting a kegerator is to no longer buy beer, right?.... but that is where we have ran into a big snag. They don't make Light, domestic beers for the size of keg you need (5 gallons) if you want to store two kegs in it.

{"review": "Very average product not impressed. The assembly was not hard, but I noticed immediately the inside is tiny! The inside of the door is even convex to add another 1.5” or so to fit another keg. The point of having 2 taps is to tap 2 kegs simultaneously and there is barely room for 2 sixtels. Yes, they fit but there is zero room left for any cans, growlers or bombers. My old kegerator could fit a half barrel with plenty of room left over – this will take getting used to. DRIP TRAY – absolutely worthless. It comes with a cheap plastic POS that hardly covers the distance between the 2 taps. You will need to upgrade. PARTS: it does come with everything you need including a 5 lb CO2 tank which is nice, but they are all cheap. The CO2 regulator is nothing more than a tee so if you only have 1 keg tapped you have to worry about CO2 leaking out of the other tap. The clamps they give you for the CO2 and beer hoses are plastic and need to be upgraded to steel to ensure a fit. TAPS/SANKES – here in lies my biggest complaint. They provided 2 US Sankes (D Class) along with the kegerator that were both defective. Neither tap actually worked to tap a US microbrew keg (and I tried 4 different brewers). I had to get with their customer service (this is external to Amazon) and after weeks of back and forth sending pictures and treating me as if I don’t know anything about brewing, they agreed to send 2 more provided I send the 2 back. I did so and it took almost 3 week for the new ones to arrive and those also DO NOT WORK. I had it with their company and went to Amazon and purchased another D coupler that works just fine to accompany one I already had. I don’t know what their major malfunction was but their couplers are garbage and don’t even tap a keg – I had to pay additional cash to get a decent one. FAUCETS – this was mentioned in other reviews but the faucets are cheap and seize up if you don’t pull them every day. I’d recommend upgrading to Perlicks which are awesome. CREAKING – every new appliance typically creaks and you hear knocks once in a while until settled but holy crap this unit sounds like machine gun fire. I’ve now owned the unit for 2 months and it still makes loud abrupt noise throughout the night when it’s quiet enough to hear it from the bar. Extremely annoying, but being it weighs a hundred lbs and it so large I refuse to go through the nightmare of a return. If this gets better I will amend my review.

My suggestion is to plan ahead and keep your mini keg in the fridge to cool and then bring it out when you are ready to use it. The unit will keep it frosty for you longer.

However, the parts needed to operate the machine did not arrive until after Christmas. The items missing were: The dispenser handle, the cord to power the machine and the drip tray, the pressurized connector, cleaning bottle, the cord for the car and the very important instruction manual. If we had received the owner's manual with the initial deliver we would have been able to determine what was missing. As of December 6th delivery we had only received the dispenser handle!!!. I left messages with Carrie Williams through email and voice mail. Initially I thought we were unable to connect, due to our time difference and my work schedule and both my husband and daughter called. However, after several voice mails and emails had not been responded to, I realized this was not the case. On December 26, I called the company again. I was given a lot of excuses and the blame was placed on the USPS system. When I asked the to have the items still needed to be sent Priority Mail, I was told only part of the missing items would be sent. During my conversation with the man this morning, he admited that he didn't know why 3 items were listed on the invoice and only one arrived. He didn't seem to know where these items were and why they weren't all packaged together. After that I asked for a supervisor and was given his voice mail. However this supervisor did call me back immediately. Rudy, the supervisor promised that I would receive everything by tomorrow. But when I asked about the items that we initially asked for to be sent with those priority mailed, I was told I would have to wait to see if they arrived as planned through USPS. So we are once again waiting for the first items. I was given a lot of excuses as to why this happened. This company does not want to take responsibility for the actions of their employees. Compact needs to retrain and monitor their employees in the customer service and warehouse departments. This is not a good way to do business. After New Year's Day and help from Yves at Amazon, we received the final part and had the and were told the Owner's Manual only came as a PDF file. After Yves talked to the supervisor at Compact, we received the final part. It was thrown in a box unwrapped with another part and a small piece of bubble wrap.

Now I have a working non-pressurized mini keg system and it's great! Whether you brew your own beer and want to eliminate the bottles or it you want to buy growlers from your local favor micro brew and keep it pressurized, this is a nice system.

{"review": "For starters, stop reading reviews prior to 2011. The early issues with this kegerator have been addressed to the point Nostalgia really should assign it a new model number. As reported by others the regulator is now a pretty nice dual gauge unit, with a lockable output valve. Meaning once you get your CO2 settings dialed in you can lock the knob so it doesn't get changed accidentally while changing out a keg, etc. Also, the unit is dead quiet. The instructions have been completely revamped and are very easy to follow. All the spare parts provided have been labeled in the manual, no mysteries there either. Before this arrived I downloaded a PDF copy of the old instructions, and it's true the early buyers were basically left in the dark. I followed the instructions, charged my tank, threw in a 1/4 barrel, and no problems at all. The beer has a perfect head on it, and my monitoring of temps have been hovering around 34-35f. That's with the thermostat set to maximum, so I'll be watching that closely. I don't want my beer to freeze! A few things to note: 1) The keg tower rubber washer (#5) was not already installed, and is not really mentioned in the manual. Be sure to install it otherwise there's not a tight seal between the tower and fridge and cool air will escape. You'll know if it's not on because the tower installs too easy and doesn't feel tight. The nice side effect of this design is that the tower is basically cooled, so less stale beer in the line. 2) A 5 pound CO2 tank will fit with a full 1/2 barrel, and can be bought at a local gas supply or welding shop filled for about 50 bucks. Refills on the tank are around $9. The 2.5 pound tank shipped is fine, and I'll be filling it so I have a full tank at all times. The 2.5 pound tank should be able to dispense 2-4 1/2 barrel kegs, the 5 pound tank 4-8 1/2 barrel kegs. Tighter fittings, lower CO2 settings, more kegs... 3) The casters are optional, and there are already self leveling feet installed if (like me) you prefer the unit to be shorter and stationary. Height to the top of the fridge door is exactly 31 inches without the caster installed. Anyway, given all the features and the insane price of $380 shipped I can't see how anyone could be unhappy at this point. All the negative reviews made me really ponder this purchase, but I'm happy to report they're all talking about a different product. I'll post a follow up at 12 months, or before if I experience any problems. And thanks to the early buyers who posted reviews! Nostalgia listened and thanks to you I have a really nice unit.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "NOTE: I've updated this post in March of 2013, after a year of ownership. My basic feelings of the kegerator are still the same--but I just wanted to update some of the information provided in this review. In summary, I did end up replacing the regulator with a higher-quality one. ---------------- This is an excellent kegerator. We purchased it as a Christmas gift for my dad, and we are currently on our second half-barrel of lager! I was a bit skeptical of this based on previous reviews, but as many reviews state, Nostalgia had changed some parts and old issues are no longer present with this model. LOOKS We all think it's a good looking unit. Nostalgia offers the same unit but with a stainless steel door. I decided against the stainless steel model because we currently have stainless steel appliances and they show smudges and fingerprints easily. We keep the kegerator in our garage so the black is more appropriate. This unit also features a rounded front door, so the keg partially hangs out when the door is open. Most other kegerators have a flat door, which makes the whole unit looks larger. It is also not the highest quality appliance you will find, as the internals of this unit seem to be a bit plasticky, especially next to a nice, expensive refrigerator. But if you temper your expectations, you will be very happy with it. ASSEMBLY The instructions are a bit frustrating. Each section doesn't seem to be in proper order. Also, there are plenty of extra little parts that come with it. I still don't know where they all go, but it's good to have them I guess. My best advice to get it up and running as soon as possible: * first have a keg ready to go (call a local beer store, and have them order and hold a keg of your favorite beer until you're ready for it--it may take a few days for them to get the keg if it is not in stock). * Unbox the unit and put the casters on (not too tightly or they will be difficult to spin). * Plug it in and turn the thermostat to the coldest setting. * Get your Co2 tank filled up. I took mine to a paintball place, but you can also try a welding or outdoor sport shop. If you're still stuck, call a hardware store for some suggestions. Also, the beer store you're getting your keg from may swap Co2 tanks. Take your time with assembly and read the instructions carefully. It may be a bit frustrating at times with all the different sized washers and parts, but keep at it and you will work through it just fine. At first, I used nylon tape on the fittings, but later found that there is no point to this, as the various washers in place are there to stop leaks, rendering the nylon tape unnecessary--but there is no harm in doing so. I had a tough time getting the tower on with the rubber washer (the instructions didn't say to put it on but it is in the parts bag, and the tower doesn't fit right without it). I recommend putting some dish soap on both sides of the washer, put it in place, stand on the left side (when you're facing the unit) and hold the unit in place with your knee while you push down hard and turn the tower clockwise until it locks. It may take a few tries and some effort but it eventually fits snug and will help keep cold air in. REGULATOR Past complaints have been about the regulator. The old regulator was a single gauge--this newer one is a dual gauge. After a few months of usage, I decided to replace the regulator due to it allowing the keg to become over-pressurized despite my low-psi setting. The Co2 pressure SHOULD remain constant throughout the life of your Co2--if you are constantly fighting the pressure, get rid of the regulator and buy a new one. Over-pressurizing your keg will waste Co2 and end up costing you more money and frustration anyway. After some research, regulators from Micromatic seem to be held in high regard, so I went ahead and purchased one from their website (dual-guage, premium, part #642). If you do purchase a new regulator, remember to get a new gas line and barbed tip so you can connect it to the keg coupler--Micromatic sells all of this. I've had zero issues since changing the regulator. Also, the regulator I purchased was a bit larger than the stock one, so it may be a tight fit depending on your keg and Co2 tank sizes. Remember that when you have a new keg, the keg is already pressurized somewhat, so you will need very little Co2 pressure through the first few pours until the keg pressure is relieved, or alternatively relieve the pressure using the pressure relief valve on the tap. After that, you will have slower pours, which is your cue to turn up the pressure. Don't turn it up too high or else you will get foamy pours. There is a relief valve on the regulator to reset the pressure which is helpful during adjusting. There is another relief valve on the keg tap as well, which can also help troublesome pours. This kegerator comes with a 5lb Co2 tank, but it was quickly swapped out for a larger tank. It may be a good idea down the road to get a 10lb tank and keep the included smaller tank as a spare. Another note: always remember to use a nylon washer between your Co2 tank and the regulator. Failing to use a nylon washer will result in a leak. If you swap your tank at a beer store, they will likely give you a washer. The Micromatic regulator I've described above has a permanent washer in place. THERMOSTAT Some reviewers wrote about modifying the thermostat by removing the cover on the thermostat and adjusting the little screw. I would recommend taking a wait and see approach to determine whether you need to do this--you don't want to adjust it too much and unnecessarily freeze up your beer (most beer freezes around 28-29 degrees). I ended up waiting 24 hours before I gave the adjustment screw a clockwise turn, waited a few hours, then checked again (my keg was hovering around 40 degrees, I was shooting for about 36). After the adjustment, the temp has been steady around 36. THERMOSTAT ADJUSTMENT Here is how to get to the adjustment screw: first, unplug the unit, then on the back of the unit, turn the temperature dial to the max setting, then pull the knob off. Now, remove the two screws that hold the thermostat housing to the side of the kegerator. Then remove the two screws to take the thermostat off of the housing. Then on the thermostat, there is a small phillips screw above the temperature adjustment dial. Turn it once clockwise to go colder, counter-clockwise to go warmer (just one turn was all I needed). Put everything back together, plug the unit back in, then wait a couple of hours before you check the temperature and make another adjustment as necessary. After a year of ownership, the kegerator has remained cool and reliable. CLEANING An important topic that I did not previously cover in my original review. Make sure you buy a nice kegerator cleaning kit (I recommend this one: Beer Line Cleaning Kit). You will want to keep the beer lines clean, otherwise, bacteria from the beer line can creep back into the beer, causing the beer to go bad. I recommend cleaning the lines after every keg change--it's a simple process of disconnecting the lines and running a cleaning solution through the lines, as well as disconnecting the tap and cleaning some of the little parts. There are also little parts for attaching to the tap to cover the tap opening when not in use for extended periods of time--they can be easily found on Amazon. I have not had any shipping/packaging issues that other reviewers spoke of. I also have not had any reason to contact Nostalgia customer support. NOTES: Some issues people commonly have, especially when they are new to kegs, are that the beer either comes out too slow (which basically means you're out of Co2 or don't have enough pressure), or the beer comes out too fast (meaning too much Co2 is in the keg), resulting in a foamy mess. Firstly, your regulator has two gauges--one, (the left side) gauge, shows the pressure coming from your Co2 tank, and the other (the top gauge), shows the pressure you are delivering to the keg. Typically, the left-side Co2 tank gauge reads anywhere from 500 to 1000 bar psi (which will vary on the tank temperature), and it is perfectly normal for the tank to read in this range when it has enough Co2. When your tank begins to run out, it will quickly hit zero. And when you're setting up a new keg, the pressure may fluctuate a bit as the system normalizes, so while the correct pressure may be set once you first hook up a fresh keg, checking back an hour or two later, you may notice it needs readjusting. This is normal. Now, in the event that you over-pressurize your keg, it means you have way too much Co2 in there, and as a result, your beer will come out very fast and very foamy. Some reviewers blame this on the kegerator, but really it is their own fault. The simple solution is this: close the valve on your Co2 tank as well as close the switch on your regulator. Then, find the relief pin on your keg tap (you have two relief pins--one on the regulator, one on the keg tap). Pull this pin hard (helpful if you use a pair of pliers) and it will slowly release the pressure in your keg. It may take a minute or two, but the pressure will slowly die down. When the pressure is relieved, start pouring beer until the pour is too slow (it may even take a few pitchers more of foamy beer, but it will get there--be patient). Finally, when the pour is too slow, open your Co2 tank valve, then turn on the regulator switch to the open position as well, and finally slowly adjust your Co2 on the regulator until you get a nice pour. It may take a while and readjusting in an hour or two, but be patient! Finally, when your keg is kicked, close off the valve on your Co2 tank as well as the switch on the regulator to avoid losing any Co2. Overall, I think you will be very happy with this unit. It's one of the cheapest ones you'll find on the internet, so as long as you take your time setting it up and do your research on this unit to find out its quirks, you will be happily pouring fresh, draft beer in no time!

{"review": "I too was a little skeptical at first, but it all worked out fine. First off; read, read, read others reviews for installation tips. I did and it all worked out for the best. First off, if you're going to go ahead and upgrade to a 5-gal CO2 tank, do it and order at the same time you order your kegorator. You'll end up saving a few dollars. I didn't and instead of paying $60 through Amazon, I paid $90 + tax for an empty tank. Here are more recommendations: 1. The instuctions are a little vague, but try to follow them and the recommendations of others. There are lots of extra little gaskets and misc. parts that are shipped with your unit. Don't panic and think you've missed a step. 2. As recomended, use teflon tape on all fittings. 3. It doesn't tell you in the manual, but do as others recommende and USE the rubber gasket when you install the beer dispenser tower. I sprayed the gasket with WD-40 first. It was still a bit of work to twist and lock the tower, but if you omit installing this gasket, you'll lose cold air. 4. When you first instal your CO2 tank to set your pressure, be sure to turn the regulator valve all the way off, the open the tank valve (just one turn), then open your regulator valve to the required pressue (7-11 psi). I found it easier to set the preferred pressure at the CO2 valve and when it stabilized, I used the allen wrench to lock the regulator valve at that pressure. Note: Be patient when making this adjustment. Turn it slighly and wait for it to stabilize. 5. I was one of the unfortunate few who's kegorator did not get cold enough at first. The coldest it got was 40 degrees with it turned to MAX and waiting overnight for it to cool down. I followed the recommendation of others, removed the thermostat housing and thermostat, adjusted the screw a few turns clockwise and reinstalled thermostat. Now the temperature sits at 36 degrees with the thermostat set just a 1/2\" before the max setting. Now for the not so good part. After all was said and done (e.g. correct temperature and CO2 pressure), I tapped my keg and discovered that I had a faulty beer line. It had a pin hole at the 90-degree bend of the beer line tail piece. Beer went everywhere which of course rendered the unit unuseable. I called the number in the instruction booklet, explainded my issue and they sent a complete beer tower at no cost. BTW, I went ahead a purchased a replacement metal tail piece at a local Home Brew store, cut the plastic tube, inserted the new piece, clamped it down with one of the 'extra' clamps provided and it works fine. I have an extra beer tower just in case. I now have ice cold Yuengling Lager on tap. So, if you follow the recommendation of others, and with a little patience, you shouldn't have many, if any, issues. Update: It's been well over a year and my Kegorator is still working like a charm. Cold, cold beer! Cheers.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I ordered this item on September 14th. Didn't get delivered until October 4th. Way out of the time range that was initially given. Product information made it appear that all you would need to do is supply the Keg and get the CO2 tank filled. WAY OFF. The \"regulator\" that comes with the Kegerator doesn't regulate ANYTHING its simply an off on switch for the CO2. After spending 2 days wasting beer I took it to my local tavern and confirmed what I already thought. So I had to drive to my local Beer Supply store and spend an additional $50 for an actual regulator. Then I experienced the problem that any regulator you buy doesn't connect to the supplied air hose as it should. Next stop Ace hardware where i purchased new tubing and fittings (another $10 down the drain). Upon affixing my new regulator and air hoses I realized that the beer comes out WAY too fast causing an excessive amount of foam. Last trip to Ace Hardware and got a water flow restricter for another $3 and now at long last i finally have a fully operational kegerator. Cheers and have fun.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "Purchased this kegorator late December 2011. The other positive reviews were accurate. I did have to remove the preassembled black washer at the bottom end of the faucet tower and move it to get a snug fit. A lot of extra small parts, so don't be surprised if you have a bag full of washers and extra pieces. On my second keg now. Beer is nice and cold. Around 40 degrees according to my thermometer. Had a small CO2 leak at first, but tightened up one of the connections, and no problems since. Be sure to run a soap test on all of the connections from the CO2 tank to the tap. Have my pressure set around 7 PSI. Pouring with just the right amount of head, not too foamy. I thought the instructions were pretty good. I would purchase again and do recommend. Easier than expected, once you know about the washer on the tower. Thanks to previous posters for that information. Very helpful. If I have a problem, I will report back.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I was looking for an inexpensive kegerator and didn't give this unit much of a look because there were several unflattering reviews on various sites. The major complaints seemed to be: 1) The unit would not go below the low 40's 2) The package included a single guage regulator However, there are various forums that gave detailed instructions on how to get around these limitations. First, the thermostat can be removed and with the turn of a screw the temperature can easily be lowered into the 30's. Second, a dual gauge regulator can be purchased and installed for about $50. I am hardly the handiest guy in the world but I had no problems doing this. I've owned this unit for about 2 weeks now and with these modifications I'm now enjoying ice-cold beer. I base my rating on quality of the unit for the price that I paid for it. I also took the time to document my experiences with the unit - I hope this proves useful to someone that either owns one or is thinking of buying one. [...]", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "Ok, First of all, like a couple of the other RECENT reviewers have said, disregard the old reviews. The reviews prior to 2010 need to be taken down because this is NOT the same product. This thing arrived in a box in a box, 100lbs. Shipping took about 4 days. My groomsman bought me this off my wedding registry so I was astounded when I got it. Everything comes packed nice. PROS- IT SERVES ICE COLD BEER Directions very easy to follow and put together. Fits 2 5.5 gal kegs (if you want to convert into dual tap) and the normal 13gal kegs just fine. Comes with a 2.5lb tank. I had a spare 5 gal tank and it fits in there with both kegs also just fine. Drip tray, tower and door are very solid (the door is swappable to left to right also) The tap handle is very stout and springy, which is good when my gigantic milled aluminum handle does not feel like its going to break it. CONS- It does not cook bacon The regulator is very finiky, the pressure on it goes from 0-150 which its like a 1/150th of a turn to move it a couple PSI up. I keep the keg right around 10lbs to keep the foam down, pours a little slow... but perfect head. As others have said, it comes with a gaggle of spare parts, which is cool if it breaks something ever, but kind of confusing at first. TIPS- The tower does not say to install the rubber washer which leaves the tower a little loose but it does come with one. It was VERY hard to get on, I took some silicon spray and wet both sides of the washer to get it loose and was able to push down hard enough on the tower to get it to set. Now its stout and keeps cold air in. I leave the temperature dial at about 3/4 which puts my beer right at 34 degrees. I had it set to 32 degrees which the dial was almost all the way up and it froze the beer line to the tower. For the price of this thing, you cannot go wrong, Im exited to try to get it converted to hold 2 5.5 gal kegs and have a couple of different brews. I will post back when I do!", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I bought this at Fry's Electronics. It was on sale at the end of the summer, and was an impulse buy... A complete piece of garbage, this company should be embarassed! The regulator is cheap, and does not work at all. There is no way to control the flow with it. The C02 tank is held in with a big rubber band (Actually, an O-ring) that broke the first time I took the tank out. I took it out because 1/3 of the way thru the first keg, the tank was empty... That's how bad it leaked... It came with a whole bag of \"extra\" seals and gaskets, and half of them do not exist in this product... I have no idea what they are for... A real kegerator will have a C02 shutoff... This one does not. A real regulator will have two gauges, one for tank pressure and the other for line pressure... This \"Toy\" has only one, and it's the cheapest gauge I think I have ever seen... The first beer out of the keg was fun... Until we realized that even turned to max cold, the beer was way too warm... There are some discussions of this thing on the internet where people have modified it so that it will get colder... I had not gotten around to trying it yet, since the summer was over and it wasn't a real priority any more... Then the thing quit working entirely. Completely dead. I have it installed in our guest/pool house, and I had been out there a few times but never realized it wasn't running any more. (It's pretty cold out there in the fall and winter, so the thing wasn't working real hard) Take my advice... Spend $50 more than this and buy at least a Haier... I have a friend with one of those and it's been working great for 6 or seven years... He keeps it outside in his barbecue island, (In the 110 degree heat) and it keeps his beer frosty cold! This is the worst waste of time and money I have ever experienced... It lasted 2/3 of the way thru 1 pony keg! Absolute garbage.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "So I was skeptical to order this kegerator, but after reading some of the more recent reviews I decided to take the plunge. Unit arrived in 3 business days, and didn't take too long for me to put together. I ordered a 1/2 keg, and went to my local welding supply to get the CO2 tank filled. When I put this kegerator to the test I was initially disappointed that it seemed to be hovering in the 46-48 degree range. I tried to pour a beer, but it just had too much foam. After reading some recommendations on some forums, I took the faceplate off the thermostat, and then found the calibration screw. I gave it a few turns clockwise, and waited an hour. When I came back the temperature was now 42 degrees. With another couple turns of the adjustment screw the unit was staying in the 36-38 degree range no problem. After attaining the proper temperature, the beer poured PERFECTLY at ~9.5 psi. Very excited I was able to get it working, and now I can relax and enjoy fresh draft microbrews at home :-D P.s. As other reviewers have stated there is a rubber ring that goes under the tap tower, but it does not tell you to install it in the instructions. The tower isn't very sturdy unless you put the rubber ring under it. Once I put it under, and twisted the tap tower to lock it in, it was sturdy and solid.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I have been saving for a personal 5L beer keg dispenser after seeing all my 'cool-friends' with the Heineken Beer-tender, but the reviews on their life-span turned out to be true (they quit if you keep a close to empty in the unit for more than a day or two) and I wanted something that operated differently. I love this machine for the most part, and am working on making adjustments to the parts that are a miss for me. I love that it holds 2 x 5 Liter kegs and the accessories that come with the machine will allow you to use virtually ANY 5L keg style out there: Co2 pre-charged kegs like Heineken and Newcastle as well and any un-charged keg. The fact that this is an actual fridge protects the item from conking out because of a no-load melt-down like the other dispensers I have experience with. Now the misses on this unit; this is a fridge and it boasts a glass shelf to chill your beer glasses. This is included and a really cool idea, however the shelf is way to close to the top of the chiller for anything taller than a shot-glass and so is pretty much useless for any practical use. Maybe someday I'll find some glasses that fit in there but right now I just can't make it work. Next miss, and this is the biggest one; the pour spout looks very large and so you would think the flow of the brew would be almost as fast as a bar tap. Unfortunately this was very far from reality. The handle uses a 3/16\" ID vinyl tube identical to the kind used in an aquarium aerator pump. The pour is excruciatingly slow! The tap handle works by pinching the tubing within the plastic spout but there is room for a slightly bigger tube. Today I went to a local hardware store and picked up a 1/4\" ID vinyl tube and installed it,(after sterilizing) this helped quite a bit but is still way too slow for my taste. The speed is slower than the included tap on a Heineken 5L for reference. I will continue to work on this and it is usable, just a sticking point for me but NOT a reason avoid this machine. The LED light is a cool idea, but that is about as much effort as they put into it. The light can be seen if you look through the window, but doesn't light up the fridge interior unless all the external lights are off in the room. In fact I forget it's on some times and leave the room because I can't tell that it's doing anything by just glancing at it. LED's run cool and it's a great idea, just no follow though on this. The temperature adjustment is very cool(no pun intended) and even though the fridge settings bottom out at 38 degrees, the fridge is normally sitting at 36 degrees making very tasty beer. The door is not reversible as described in the product features, the latch is molded on the door and cannot be opened from the right side. Co2 control seats well and is easy to setup and adjust. Overall I am really pleased with this product and do recommend this to others as a more reliable alternative to the Beer-tender, but I recommend it most for those who are home-brewers and aren't afraid to 'tinker' with the tap handle to get a better flow. I am most excited about the home-brewing aspect of this products versatility, as I myself have just started a batch of Oktoberfest home-brew and just ordered a Keg 5 Liter Party Keg with Tap for Homebrew and am beyond excited to have my brew on tap for my friends instead of passing out bottles.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I bought this on a whim. I had been thinking about putting my homebrew in kegs but didn't want to deal with the expense and complication of a kegging system and a kegerator. As I looked at this I saw that it could substitute for the mechanics of that system as long as I could get my homebrew into mini-kegs. The good news is that it can be done, the bad news is that mini-kegs seem to be in high demand and low production so there will be a wait for the empty kegs to get started. In the mean time I have substituted a pre-made mini keg. I chose one that is not of the pre-charged variety (Heinekin, New Castle) as my own will not be pre charged. The good: The setup was easy and installing the first mini-keg was as easy as tapping and putting in the fridge. There is space to keep some glasses on the shelf, although not much, to have a chilled vessel to contain your brew. The unit looks sharp and will give you some bragging rights when your buddies are over for football. The ability to store a spare is a great feature. It is pretty cool to have a nice, cold, draft beer from the comfort of your family room/man-cave. The not so good: The draft tube to the front of the unit is a pretty small diameter. It takes about a minute or so to fill a standard pint glass. This isn't a deal breaker, but when the previously mentioned buddies line up, that pour time takes the shine of the apple, a bit. The unit looks sharp, but on closer inspection, chrome parts turn out to be shiny plastic and the unit overall has a bit of a cheap feel. The bad: The unit is noisy, not off the scale, but distracting when it kicks on during a movie. The regulator system is SUPER cheap. I had to add an o-ring to keep my cartridges from losing pressure (I wasted 3 in 3 days before I figured it out). The knob to adjust the pressure just keeps going tighter, sometimetimes with no result, other times by over presurizing the mini. I would say that overall this unit will perform as advertized, just don't expect to be blown away.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "Picked up mine last year post x-mas. Still love it!!! Do have some difficulty in NJ finding gravity kegs though. I keep two kegs in it at all times...usually a Heiniken or New Castle and then another that is run off of the coolers co2 system. I have found the 9oz co2 canisters work the best. The 16 grams tubes tend to leak unless u apply a little pipe tape. I was surprised that the 16g are not threaded, it would work much better. Was originally drawn to the unit for its 2 keg size and because the cooling system is actually run off of a compressor and not a thermal cooling plate. Had one of them a few years ago and it burned out pretty quickly as most of them seem to do. All in all it seem to work like a charm...highly recommended!!", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I've had this product for over a year now. I got it because I am a homebrewer, but don't have the space in my apartment to go to a full 5-gallon keg sytstem. Don't bother trying to use the 16 g CO2 cartridges - the o-ring seal on the attachment-nut piece is cheap, and will not properly seal the cartridge. Therefore you'll go through tons of the cartridges, and wind up with a lot of flat kegs of beer. I use a standard 12oz and 20 oz paintball canister that you can get at Dicks or off of amazon - which scews into the regulator directly. You can still get the 20 oz canister to hang from the hangar on the inside of the door - but you won't be able to fit two kegs. The faucet that comes with the unit works fine - the tubing is 1/8\" ID, which does make for a deliberate pour, but smaller diameter tubing can also help to reduce foam. I wound up modifying the door so that I could install a bar-quality tap faucet from a homebrew supply store and use cornelius-style kegs (also from a homebrew supply store), but the existing faucet gets the job done. The one thing that I can't modify is the noise that this thing makes when the compressor kicks in. It is very noticeable, especially if you have it in a room where you watch tv. Overall I am happy with this product, it only gets three stars because the 16 g co2 cartridge option just doesn't work reliably, and the noise.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "Love the fact that it holds 2 kegs. No more discovering there's only a dribble left and the next one isn't chilled. Have to agree with people who say the glass shelf is really a waste of space. Too small for most beer glasses. I would have preferred to not have that and the machine to be a little smaller instead. However, it fits nicely on my kitchen counter, and looks good. The noise issue that people have commented on is nothing like as bad as some make out. Yes, it switches on and off like any fridge, but it doesn't intrude. At least it will (hopefully) be more long-lasting than my old thermo-electric beer chiller, which failed after a year.

Slid glass shelf forward and got 3 small glasses in back, 2 pint glasses in front of them (inside roof slopes up as it comes forward) and place 2 on side on shelf with a small container of sliced limes.

Also, the item stopped working between 18-24 months after receiving it. Turned to the operating manual to determine the problem -- no help in giving a cause.

{"review": "Update two years later: I still LOVE my EdgeStar Kegerator. It still keeps my beer ice cold. I recently bought an AcuRite Deluxe Wireless Weather Center (atomic clock) at Costco (for about $30). The reason I bought it is that it has an outside transmitter that sends the outside temperature to the unit so you can tell what the temp is outside as well as inside. This unit also measures humidity and some other stuff I wasn't interested in. I wanted to monitor my beer temperature without having to open the fridge door. I simply put the outside transmitter inside the kegerator on top of my keg. It works GREAT! In fact, the unit I bought not only tells you the current temp (inside and outside) but it also registers the high and low for the day. It resets itself at midnight each night. So now, with the outside transmitter sitting on top of my keg inside the kegerator, I not only know the exact temperature of my beer at the time I'm pouring it, but also the range that my EdgeStar has kept my beer for the past day. Knowing the current temp was my target. Getting a 24 hour high and low is a real bonus. As said before, I like my beer near freezing. Several times I came up with frozen lines and had to let them thaw. Now, I can see the temperature range for the past 24 hours and monitor the low to make sure I don't freeze again. Still a very happy beer drinker. Original Review: I did a lot of research on kegerators before deciding to buy this one by EdgeStar. I have wanted a kegerator for years to replace the system I had in an old refridgerator in the garage. What prompted me to actually pull the trigger is that I saw one at Costco for under $400. I came home and began researching that unit online. What a rip! Breaking down.....poor customer service....beer not getting above 40 degrees. Yuck!! Then I stumbled on this unit from EdgeStar. While there were no reviews for this dual tap model in Amazon, I was able to find plenty of written reviews on their single tap models. I called Edgestar to verify that the dual and single units were, in fact, the same fridge and they are. Several of the reviewers mentioned that they couldn't get the unit below 40 degrees (much like most of the other manufacturers I researched) but that just one call to EdgeStar customer service resulted in very detailed instructions on how to adjust the thermostat to get the unit to go lower. I put mine together in a matter of 30 minutes and had it plugged in and cooling down. I didn't put a keg into it for maybe 5 days wanting to see if it would be cold enough. Sure enough, mine got to 40 degrees and stopped there. I like my beer very cold......I mean near frozen.....so I wanted to get this new unit down to maybe 33 or 34 degrees. I emailed EdgeStar customer service one evening around midnight. When I got up in the morning I had an email response with an explanation of various factors that could prevent it from getting cold enough. For example, having it outside or building it in so there isn't enough space around the unit for the cooling system to operate efficiently. Mine is free standing so I didn't have any of the issues that would have prevented it from getting cold enough. The email went on to provice very detailed instructions on how to reset the thermostat to get it to cool down more. They even provide pictures showing the procedure step by step. The final step was to tighten the little set screw in \"finger tight\" then back it off 2 full turns. After reassembling the thermostat it suggests letting it work for 24 hours. I did and MAN! did it work a lot better. In fact, the instructions state that if it gets too cold you need to repeat the last step and back the set screw off 3 full turns instead of 2. Since my unit got to 30 degrees overnight (and froze the beer lines that lead to the tap tower) I repeated Step 5 and backed it back 3 full turns. Now, two days later, my beer comes flowing freely at 33 or 34 degrees. JUST AS I LIKE IT!! If you are considering a new kegerator, EdgeStar units are GREAT!! Their customer service is lightning fast and very easy to deal with. Also, while you are spending $450 to $499 for a single tap unit, go ahead and get the two tap unit. It's only about $50 more and gives you plenty of options as to what beers you can enjoy. Two of the 1/6th barrel tall skinny kegs fit perfectly in there. There are lots of beers available in 1/6th kegs so you can be the King of the Keg in your neighborhood by having the only duel tap in your Man Cave!! Besides, you also have the option of putting a half or quarter barrel in there too. They all fit!! So, don't just sit there reading and researching. Buy this unit and start enjoying an ICE COLD BEER!!!", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "If you are a fan of craft beer (aka the good stuff), then this kegerator is perfect. Many of the negative reviews about this unit claim that it does not drop to a low enough temperature. I have mine set at 3 (the middle setting) and my beer pours at around 38*F (the optimal serving temp. for most beer types). The individuals making the claim that this kegerator does not get cold enough have generally indicated that they are specifically using it for Bud/Miller/Coors. The lower a beer's temperature, the less flavor/taste you will be able to perceive. With Bud/Miller/Coors, you want them virtually freezing because they taste awful. One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember when setting up the kegerator is to make sure you use the provided rubber gaskets when connecting the couplers to the beer lines. It's not explicitly stated in the set-up instructions, but if you do not do this, the lines will not be water tight and beer will drip down everywhere as soon as the kegs are tapped. Lastly, if you will be using this unit for craft beer, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing two low profile couplers: Low Profile US Sankey Keg Coupler - D System While the unit comes with two regular couplers, many craft breweries use rubber-handle sixtels which are too tall to fit in the unit when tapped with the provided couplers.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I am new to kegerators. I did lots of research.. on lots of websites... on lots of different products. This product seemed to have the best reviews. I decided to go with this unit. One common complaint that I found in all of the reviews on this unit is that the temperature doesn't get cold enough. Edgestar claims that this unit will get to anywhere from 37-41 degrees. For the most part, this is accurate. If you're like me, though, you want COLD beer (I mean real COLD). This unit is capable of getting colder. You just have to call Edgestar's customer service department, and they will email you instructions on how to make this unit colder (you can also find these same instructions in other beer forums if you search for them on google). Right now my kegerator is about 36-37 degrees. I would definitely recommend upgrading to a Dual gauge CO2 regulator as well as a better drip tray. Overall, I'm pleased with this product. I've had to learn a few things along the way as far as regulating the CO2 correctly, fixing CO2 leaks, etc; but I've been happy with this unit. I've learned everything through internet videos and forums. You just can't beat two beers on tap any time you want. If you're considering buying a kegerator or not, GET ONE! You'll thank yourself for it, and your friends will thank you as well. Whether or not you buy this unit or not... do your own research. Find a unit that's best for you and that fits your budget.

{"review": "So i've had this bad boy for a few months now and here are my pro's and cons. Pros: Cold beer on tap = happy me Wasn't that difficult to set up Got me to start brewing my own beer again. Cons: The regulator they shipped me had a hairline crack in it which burned through $40 of CO2 and ruined 2 corny kegs ($200+) worth of beer. My gut told me it was the regulator - but instead I followed the advice of the air gas guy and replaced all my hosing. Smelt heavily of tobacco when I first got it - kind of like this thing was stored in a cigarette bar and uses as an ashtray in its previous live. I found out after buying the EdgeStar, that a \"sixtel\" (a 1/6th) keg of beer costs a lot of freaking money. It is actually cheaper for me to just buy an equivalent amount of six packs from my local beverage depot than it is to buy a sixtel. A sixtel (which has about 52 12oz beers) in it costs me around $90-110. Comparatively a half barrel (full keg) contains 165 12oz beers at about 100-135. So if you're doing this for a cost savings - consider opting for the single line. Hell even running two single line edge stars are more cost effective than 1 dual tap. I've spoken to the manager of my beer spot about this and he's putting together a list for me of beers that come in sixtels that don't break the bank. This is something to seriously consider when consider dual tapping vs single tap. Now i've posted a lot of negatives, but why did I still give it 5 stars? Because edgestar made a great product and it works exactly how I expected it to. Over all its pretty quiet (quiet enough to sit in my living room) and because of my cost analysis I've gotten back into kegging my own beer. Now I brew one keg myself which costs about 30 bucks (after I got all the equipment) and I have one line of commercial beer flowing at any given time. So I'm a happy camper. One other thing is when researching this product I found that some people said the beer wasn't coming out cold enough and I found this to be true too - I contacted customer service and they gave me a guide (with a big old warning saying it will void my warranty) on how to drop the temp of my kegerator.

{"review": "I purchased the dual kegerator unit in May 2012 and waited until now to write a review. I've been through two 15.5 kegs and several 5 gal kegs. Once you get the right pressure dialed-in it's simple. I use 8-10ppi and seems to work well with the provided hose lengths. I do recommend getting a dual gauge regulator. I ordered one from another site (compactappliance) and forget why I got it from them instead of Amazon but their online customer service has been great. Like all things worth while, it does take a little practice to pour a proper beer (wet the glass), as well as, being comfortable changing out kegs. The biggest thing I can recommend to anyone, despite the product, is leave the keg alone once it's hooked up. It needs to settle down for a minimum of two hours before any beer can be pored with good results. The other thing is be ready to accept the keg in the fridge, don't dilly-dally trying to get it hooked-up while the fridge is getting warm with the door open. Temperature - I'm going to manually lower the thermostat while I'm in-between kegs. Right now it only gets beer to 40deg with factory settings. You can find the directions in beer forums or by calling the Edgestar hotline. I can see why they don't make it too low in temp since people can experience frozen lines and kegs. And after all, it is only a minifridge modified to a kegorator. Most refrigerators run at 40deg to keep food from freezing in cold spots. I'll probably get a mini fan (also found online) to help keep the air circulating inside to prevent extreme cold spots. It's basically just a computer/server fan with small power source. Heck, I might just build one. Noise - Yes, this does make some unusual noises from time to time (loud snap, crackle, pop) but I never really noticed it much until I took out the carpet (echo) in the room to redo with some tile or wood. I honestly don't notice it anymore and when the compressor is running it is no louder than my 55gal fish tank power filter and air pump in near-by hallway (or even my nice fridge in the kitchen). I wouldn't keep it in my bedroom (too convenient), but it's never been a distraction in our large dinning room / bar. I did a lot of research before committing and I am very pleased with my purchase.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "The stock faucets are poor and dripped. I upgraded to Perlick 525s. The thermostat did not cool the beer low enough. I rigged it based on recommendations by Edge Star and it froze the beer. I was unable to adjust so I ended up adding an external digital Johnson controller which worked great basically turning the unit off and on at the right temperature. Without these two upgrades at cost I would not be happy with this unit, however with my upgrades it does the job well. Just curious as to how long this will last. Probably would also want a roomier version to handle two European kegs.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "Directions stink... But set up is still simple. Big enough for two five gallon kegs and co2 in the fridge. Looks nice, no problems with to much foam or head which is a common cheap kegerator problem. Downside is it is loud... If going in a pantry I Or garage it is perfect....

{"review": "I love this kegerator. I've had it for about two months and run about three 1/6 barrels through it. Having draft beer at home is awesome, especially during football season! I'm glad I didn't let the other reviews scare me off. I think a kegerator is work. You have to get the beer, keep the co2 full, clean the lines often, etc. For beer lovers, its worth it. But I think some people dont realize this prior to purchase and then give bad reviews. I have had none of the temperature issues that others talk about. Stays around 38 degrees which is fine for me. I did build a tower cooler which eliminated the foamy first pour. This easy project is well worth it--I recommend it highly. You will be much more satisfied with your kegerator. The only downside is the size. You have to be very cautious of what kegs you order. If they vary from the standard size, they probably wont fit. I have two sixths now on tap. One of them was rubberized which caused them to just barely not fit together. Door wouldn't close by about an inch so I actually tied a rope around the whole thing and tied the door shut. It worked but not ideal. Also, it is loud as others have said. Compressor is loud and it pops and cracks rather loudly as it cools. But those are my only complaints. Shipped earlier than expected and was undamaged. Setup was not bad. Definitely helps to watch EdgeStars youtube videos on setup and care. Excellent price and value. I would recommend for beer lovers who realize the value you get in exchange for a little effort.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I set it up and it's been working great for a week now. It's not that difficult to set up, but the directions were not too good. Once I figured out I needed to properly install the rubber washers, the leaking stopped and it worked fine. The kegerator gets the beer cold enough and its not that loud in my opinion. Would definitely recommend to anyone on the market for a kegerator, and the dual tap is the way to go because you get the option of having two 1/6 kegs or just a single 1/4 or 1/2 keg.", "id": "2686378011"}
{"review": "I was reluctant to order this at first due to a lot of comments around the packaging of the unit and them showing up with dents and scratches. When the unit arrived the outside parcel was a bit torn. However the seller must have taken the feedback that was given and made some changes as my unit was in perfect condition without a single scratch or dent. It was double boxed. The OEM box has the unit inside with a Styrofoam shell. Then the EOM box was lined with stiff cardboard corners and wrapped in Styrofoam around that and then placed in an additional box. Only the otter box had a slight tear. Given the weight of the unit it was expected. Don't hesitate to order this unit as I'm certain it will show up in perfect condition if we were to order an additional one. The unit itself is made of quality materials. I placed a digital thermometer inside the unit and it holds a sold 37 degrees inside. Keep in mind this is a minifridge and not a cooler. A major difference. The only complaint I have about the unit is that we have it downstairs behind our bar. Not in the bar but behind it sitting on the carpet. When placed on the carpet the door would drag the carpet and after our first basement break in party the door was left slightly open a few times because the door was difficult to shut. I tried to adjust the feet to raise the unit up but was unable to do so because the legs are not adjustable. I happen to have an extra 18X18 tile from the bathroom. I sat the unit on top of the tile and it solved the problem. The door open and shuts perfectly. Keep in mind we do not have shag carpet either. It is a medium density stainmaster carpet with standard stainmaster padding. If you plan to place this in a carpeted area do yourself a favor and go purchase an 18X18 tile. As others have mentioned the shelves don't hold cans the best when you go to fill it as some tip from side to side when placed vertical. I removed the second from the bottom shelf to hold 4-5Liter kegs. I can hold exactly a case of beer in the bottom section which is not as deep as the others since the compressor housing is in the way. Which leaves me with the top full shelf and the very top shelf that holds them in a horizontal fashion. The horizontal shelf holds a 12 pack 6 on each side. Without the removal of a shelf this unit will not accommodate 16oz water bottles or beer bottles placed vertically. These will need to be placed on their sides unless you remove a shelf. Overall I would give this fridge a 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10. It servers our purposes perfectly and it looks great, and it was at a great price point. If I had to make a couple of changes or a wish list. I wish it used an LED bulb for that newer look. Additionally, I wish the light could be turned on when the door was shut since it is a glass face to showcase the drinks inside. UPDATE: Finds out there is a switch inside on the side of the light to turn it on. Check that off the lsit! Other than that it's the perfect height and the top is being used to hold our EdgeStar 5Liter Kegerator. Which places the tap at the perfect height and I am 5'10\". All in all don't hesitate to purchase this unit as I searched for several weeks and really did my homework before ordering a mini fridge for our bar when we finished the basement. I assure you that you will not find a better product at this price point. UPDATE: Over a year later this thing is still ice cold and no issues. Look no furhter, the perfect minifridge holds true!!!", "id": "2686328011"}
{"review": "So far, I am very pleased with this beverage center refrigerator. I think the company listened to some of the complaints and concerns of previous buyers and made some improvements to this model. For instance, our unit does have leveling feet in the front. The owner's manual does explain how to turn on the light so it stays on with the door closed. (Unfortunately, the light bulb is still incandescent, not LED. That would be a nice improvement but would probably add to the price.) The wire shelves really aren't too bad. After reading some of the reviews here, I was planning on putting some shelf liners in or cutting some pieces of plate glass to fit on them to keep the drink cans upright. But again, I believe the company redesigned the shelves, adding more wires to them because we haven't had too many issues with cans tipping over. In terms of performance, this unit is very quite and cools quickly. No clicking sounds as others have reported. I put a refrigerator thermometer in it so I could perfectly set the temperature. Contrary to what others reported, you can make this unit quite cold. I have it set to around 36 degrees F. according to the thermometer. I have had no problems with the drinks freezing on the bottoms shelf. The unit arrived well-packed, double boxed with no dents or cosmetic defects. One thing that I think may be causing problems for other buyers: Be sure to let the unit stay in its normal, upright position for about 5 hours after unpacking it and before plugging it in and turning it on. (This is not specified in the manual, except in one place that explains how to reverse the door so it opens the other way, and there it says to wait for one hour before turning the unit back on after tilting it backwards or laying it on its side.) All refrigeration systems have oil in the compressor that can get into the coils when the unit is tilted out of the vertical position. You need to let the unit sit for a few hours so all the oil can drain out of the coils and back into the compressor before turning it on. Otherwise, you shorten the life of the compressor. This may be why a few people complained that the unit was making loud clicking noises or not cooling very well. We can barely hear the compressor when it turns on and the internal fan is nearly silent. I have only had this beverage center running for about a week, so if I run into any issues with it in the future, I will update this review.", "id": "2686328011"}
{"review": "I was concerned given all the reviews about keeping the drinks cold enough but I use mine in my workout room to house all my exercise drinks and it keeps them plenty cold enough at a medium-high setting (probably due the fan circulating the air which most beverage coolers do not have). I haven't seen any dramatic increase in my electric bill either. My only complaint is the auto-defrost feature. It does auto-defrost and collect the water in a reservoir that is supposed to evaporate by the heat of the compressor. But in my house apparently it didn't get hot enough because it didn't evaporate and over flowed in the back and spilled out onto the floor behind the unit. Now I just keep an eye on it and use a large syringe to remove the water if the reservoir fills up.", "id": "2686328011"}
{"review": "I began researching a variety of cooling devices to store my ever-growing collection of beers and was frustrated by the dearth of information readily available for such storage. Dedicated beer refrigerators/coolers were far more expensive than their wine cooling counterparts and, given that I was looking to keep the cost relatively low, I was unwilling to shell out more than $300 for one. After seeing the wide variety of thermoelectric coolers available, I was initially reticent to purchase a refrigerator because it seemed like there was a steep price differential between the two. The more I considered proper beer storage and read about the aforementioned coolers though the less comfortable I was with using them. Ultimately, I came across the Danby DBC120BLS Beverage Center and liked what I saw in terms of the price, the reviews, and the product itself. I liked also that at least a few people were using it to store beer and so I made my purchase. I wound up setting it up last night and discovered a few things that I thought would be of interest to anyone else in search of something to use as a beer cellar. BEST ASPECTS OF USING THE DANBY BEVERAGE CENTER FOR BEER CELLARING 1. The adjustable temperature range covers a wide assortment of beers. Usually the target temperature for aging beer is between 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit. Many of the thermoelectric coolers feature extremely narrow ranges with the LOWER end being closer to the low 50s (which means that it would have to work essentially at max capacity at all times just to maintain the temperature). Plus, if there are any temperature fluctuations, say, of five degrees or more, you could wind up impacting the long term quality of your beers. The 43-57 degree range of the Danby is great because it affords more leeway, particularly if you live in an area that gets particularly warm in the summer thereby creating a substantial temperature differential between the interior and exterior of the refrigerator. 2. At the $200 price point, you'll be hard-pressed to find better capacity. By comparison, most of the wine cellars available at and around $200 hold less than 20 bottles and, in most cases, 18 or fewer. Depending upon what you are aging beer-wise, you will easily store double that amount or better with the Danby. 3. The removable shelves provide flexible storage layouts. Again, depending upon what you're looking to age, you will have a variety of options in terms of how to store your stash. The single most limiting aspect though is the type(s) of bottles that you're looking to age. When it comes to cellaring beer, the common best-practice is to store it upright, especially if the beer is corked. The problem with this is the fact that most corked bottles tend to be of the larger variety (750ml) and thus take up much more space than their twelve ounce counterparts. The existence of multiple shelf grooves will allow you to make the most of the space available but only to a certain degree. One of the photos for this unit had a comment that the user was able to get 49 twelve ounce bottles and 4 bombers for a total of 53 bottles. None of the bottles appeared to be corked and a few were being stored sideways--something to consider, again, if you have a variety of beer bottle types. As for my current setup, I have the top-most shelf in along with a single shelf towards the bottom dividing the interior into three zones. At the bottom I currently have 8 large bottles including three corked 750mls, 1 uncorked 750, and four bomber sized bottles along with 6 smaller bottles, two of which are corked. Now, you won't be able to take advantage of the full space on the lowest level because there is a small portion that juts out to allow water to drain towards the compressor during the automatic defrosting cycle. Having the corked bottles standing on a wire shelf ABOVE this point should allow you to get more in...but the thought of overloading the shelf and losing bottles of Black Tuesday and the Firestone barrel aged series made me anxious. Instead, I opted for the security of the ground level at the expense of housing a few more bottles (which, at present, I don't have). On the middle shelf I have 29 bottles approximately half of which are the standard slender 12 oz and half are the stubbier, slightly fatter bottles; these are all vertical as well. Lastly, I have six bottles stored on their side in two pyramids on the special top shelf. You lose a little bit of space at the very top so that you can keep the fan clear (the shelf is designed specifically for this purpose) so you can't make use of the ENTIRE interior. In total though, with nearly a dozen very big bottles, I was able to get a total of 49 bottles into the unit. They are perfectly chilled at the moment and, with any luck, they will remain that way for a long time to come. The bottom line: if you're looking to cellar beers then this is the ideal unit with which to do so!", "id": "2686328011"}
{"review": "I wanted a fridge for my bar area that would keep just bottles of beer and other bar things cold. So when I purchased this fridge I read it might be loud but it is definitely one of the coldest fridges. When I first received the Fridge I followed all the guidance even a little too much by letting it sit out for 2 days before plugging it in and making sure it had room to breath. My first fridge however never got cold, in fact stayed very hot. In the back what I think was the condenser was very hot to touch as the fridge was trying to blow cold air. I called up Danby customer service who was very apologetic and helpful in walking me through some steps and informing me to just request a replacement fridge from Amazon as this one seemed to be broken. So I went through and quickly received a second fridge from Amazon, which I once again followed all guidance and plugged in. This time the fridge actually started to feel as though it was blowing cold air. But to be fair it does not feel cold enough for what I wanted from my bar fridge. Even storing as little as 15 drinks in the fridge none of the drinks were cold enough to drink without getting ice, or putting into a second fridge. I never got a temperature reading but even on the coldest setting the drinks were just not cold enough for what I wanted. For some this cold level may be fine but it wasn't what I was looking for in my fridge. I do appreciate the help I received from Danby customer service and the quick turnaround from Amazon on the fridge but this Fridge is just not for me. I have returned the second fridge and will begin to look for another model that is a bit colder.", "id": "2686328011"}
{"review": "I got this for my warehouse. I have an online business that outgrew my home for inventory, so I got a small warehouse. I was kind of unsure since people say they had problems with it getting cold enough. But I'm just storing drinks for when I'm around. Because of some people voicing complaints that it didn't get cold enough, I cranked it up to max, as the warehouse isn't air-conditioned and it has been in the 90-95 degrees lately. Well, today I came into a big puddle on the floor. It got so cold it actually froze about 12 cans of Dr. Pepper, to the point they exploded. Not it's fault.

{"review": "Its like a kitchen cabinet for beer. Not soda - just beer. The advertised picture shows Diet Cokes, Pepsi and Red Bull..... Well I hide that junk in the big fridge with stainless doors so it can't be seen. The beers however I proudly display in the Danby DBC120BLS BEVERAGE CENTER. So sexy! Every time I wander into the kitchen BAM there's cold beers staring at me through the glass like a puppy in a pet store. (puppies only cats are like sodas keep them behind the stainless). Cats suck.....kittens too. A little tip for you inexperienced folks, start your beer drinking from the bottom shelf. It will be easier to grab from the higher shelves as the beers side effects kick in. Another tip: (This is only necessary if beer is stocked)... get some of those stickers that old people put on glass doors to keep them from walking face first into it. Some friends and folk that stop by for a cold one will freak the ?%** out when they see this Danby DBC120BLS BEVERAGE CENTER stocked with some of daddy's sweet sauce in a can, they may damage their wrist, or possibly their face reaching for a can. I suggest stickers of the dragonfly because dragonflies are badass. NOT as badass as puppies but badass nonetheless. Last tip: Buy this fridge. I got this machine on sale for 199. free shipping.

We had it for about 3-3 1/2 weeks now, so I've had some time to \"test it out\". We have it placed on a little wooden stand that we built for it (so it wouldn't be directly on the carpet) and made sure it had plenty of ventilation in the back as the directions recommend. We placed it in the corner of the room - probably 15-20ft away from where we sit. The fridge is loud - so much so that it disrupts our TV watching.

{"review": "Unit arrived undamaged and worked right out of the box. Door was assembled a bit crooked and overall quality is mediocre but looks good from a distance. Have had it about 5 weeks now and it is doing its job- drinks stay sufficiently cold, good capacity, internal fan helps a lot (main reason I bought it) and is quiet enough in my family room adjacent to my home theater setup. Stopped working once for some unknown reason (maybe got a bit hot as I have it installed in a tight cabinet space- IFU clearly says it is designed to be free-standing) but after unplugging and letting it sit for 30 mins, it started up again and has been fine ever since. I check the external cabinet temp regularly and while it does get quite warm to the touch, it seems to be okay installed as is. A good idea is to keep it out first time it cools down your drinks (it will work quite hard doing this), then when the compressor cycles off (ie- it has reached its set temp), you can push it back in. Overall it seems to be a good deal for the price.", "id": "2686328011"}
{"review": "Just got my cooler a week ago and I'm very happy with it. I suggest reading the other reviews as they helped guide me to selecting this product and were very helpful in describing some of the finer features that I was looking for. Now that I've unpacked and used the unit for a week or so, I thought it might be helpful to share some things that weren't obvious from the product description or other reviews: 1) The inside top of the unit slopes slightly from front to back, making it a bit less \"tall\" toward the back. I'd guess you lose a 1/2 inch or maybe a bit more in height. Not a lot, but enough that it might make you move your top rack down a notch. Also, on the right-hand side of the roof, there is a small \"something\" sticking down in the back that takes another 1/2 inch or so. 2) The door can swing fully open - there is no stop for it. The first couple of times I opened it, I didn't hang on to it and it swung clear around and hit something sitting to the right of the unit. Again, not a big deal, just keep in mind. 3) As I read one other place, there is a small drip pan in the back of the unit that is not mentioned anywhere in the product description. I haven't had the unit long enough to know whether it fills up, but have set myself a monthly reminder to check it. 4) You lose roughly half your space in the bottom 1/4 of the unit. This is the intrusion from the back where all the \"stuff\" is. There is a half-depth shelf right around there that butts up against the top of the intrusion, so you can still use the full depth at that point if it's at the right height. That was a nice feature. Below that level though, you loose half your depth. This really didn't impact me as I'm using that lower cavity for small, 100 calorie pop cans, mixers and the like. 5) While apparent from the pictures, I didn't register with me that there is no digital temperature display with this unit, just a 1-10 wheel for cooling selection. As I am using this as a beer fridge and want a particular temperature, I'm going to buy a small thermometer to put inside the unit as an aid in selecting the proper temperature. 6) Minor note - the interior light does have an on/off switch. 7) Lastly, it could just be me but I couldn't get the unit to be perfectly level from front to back. Side to side was fine, but the front of my unit shows it is a bit high even with both front legs screwed in all the way. This could be by design, but as one of those \"anal\" types, it was frustrating to not be able to get it perfectly level, lol. Overall, for the price, exactly what I was looking for.", "id": "2686328011"}

Only one note....I had seen some other reviews indicating that the fridge included blue LED lights. That might have pertained to soem other model. We got the NewAir AB-1200.

{"review": "While the packaging on this fridge seems OK, the first two boxes arrived pretty beat up and the fridges also had some dents in them. The first one we received sounded like a lawnmower when plugged in. The second one I didn't even bother taking out of the box since I noticed the corner was dented severely. There was a hole through the fragile sticker which is pretty pathetic. They clearly have some packaging/shipping problems on these. Looks like other brands of fridges have similar problems, not just NewAir. Buyer beware! This could happen to you. It might make more sense to just buy it from a local store if you don't want to take a chance. CUSTOMER SERVICE I finally decided to call an amazon customer service rep to see what they could do. He apologized that I wasn't able to get the fridge in good condition. I asked if I could have UPS ship it since the last two had been shipped by FedEx. I also wanted to be able to sign for the package in case I wanted to refuse it (our package deliverers have a bad track record of actually knocking or ringing the doorbell!). He said he would do his best to do these things. Helpful and friendly. The same customer service rep even followed up with me the next morning to see if we could call UPS and get a signed delivery. Unfortunately UPS said it was too late, that we should have done it when the package went out (not sure why there wasn't a checkbox for the service rep to check? But I don't know how their system works). That being said, the package arrived in pretty good condition (much better than the previous two attempts!) and the UPS man did ask for a signature. I was hesitant when unpacking it and plugging the fridge in, but so far everything looks OK! FINALLY! Amazon's customer service was excellent. They gave me free UPS pickup for both returns and each pickup/delivery only took one business day. As for the fridge quality itself... FRIDGE QUALITY: The Danby fridge is $100 less, and I suggest you also take a look at that one if you want something cheaper but with what looks like similar quality. This was a gift for my husband and he picked out the NewAir because of the slightly better reviews. The quality is mediocre...3/5 stars. Not nearly as good as a real fridge. A couple of the shelves aren't quite straight and the cooling metal plate at the top are not quite level either, which makes fitting some of the drinks a pain. The front with the stainless steel door looks nice. The sides are black metal and neutral, but after seeing dents in the first two I know they aren't super sturdy. The back is not metal; it looks to be made of a thin type of wood (think cardboard but sturdier). It is also open on the bottom so you can see the condenser coils. If you want to display the back I suggest getting some kind of metal grating to cover everything. It comes with what we assume is a condenser tray loosely stuck with putty on the back of the unit (not mentioned in the manual at all). We aren't quite sure if we need to reattach it...we'll figure that out later. There's also random putty in a few other places...looks a bit sloppy but I guess no one will see it since it's in the back. The door appears reversible but I don't see this mentioned in the (paltry) instructions. Also note that this is not designed to be put under a bar or counter. You unfortunately need to get an expensive fridge that vents from the front for that, or design the counter with plenty of air flow. I've had the fridge on for about a day without any drinks and it seems to go below 30 on the bottom when I measured with my thermometer...so it should keep drinks cold. It is not silent, but it isn't super loud either. I hear a humming sound and a gurgling sound when the compressor runs. The rest of the time it is quiet. As another reviewer noted, the LED lights are white, not blue...though I guess they are \"blueish\". So was this a good buy? I certainly hope so! I don't know how long this thing will last, but if we get 5 years out of it I'd be happy. I'll update this review if we run into any problems.", "id": "2686328011"}

{"review": "I was so excited to get a beverage frige so I could free up our main refrigerator for actual food. The reality was terribly disappointing. It arrived in great time and the packaging was really well done with multiple layers cardboard and polystyrene. But from the moment I opened the box though and found an extremely poorly manufactured appliance, I was let down. The stainless steel door frame was dented and scratched, the defrost tray was half hanging off the back, the cold plate was screwed on crooked, and the black interior was scratched. I was planning to keep it anyway because most of the flaws were cosmetic and I propped the defrost tray up so it would hold the run-off. I could tell the condition of the appliance was done at the manufacture level because the packaging was not damaged. I really hated the idea of packing it back up and going through the trouble of getting it shipped back. I mean it's 70 pounds. So anyway, it seemed to work ok to begin with. I really liked the LED interior lighting. I liked that I could adjust the shelving so easily to accomodate larger bottles. But by week three, it was no longer keeping the drinks cold all the time. So I sent it back and this time I'm trying the Danby which is about the same size and $100 cheaper. Again this arrived in good time in really good packaging, but I think this was previously used and refurbished because, again, the stainless door frame was scratched up and the interior showed residue of previous use. Also, the glass door is slightly scratched. What is wrong with these manufacturers?!? $200 to $300 is a lot of money for the average family! They certainly don't respect their consumers. I do have to say that the general quality of the Danby is much better than the $100 more expensive Newair. The door on the Danby is of sturdier construction, the cooling apparatus is very well made, I love that the Danby's interior light comes on when you open the door instead of having to flip the switch each time like on the Newair. The Danby's cold plate runs down the back almost to the bottom as well as it having an interior fan to move the cool air around (unlike the Newair which had the smaller cold plate crooked towards the top only). I also like the wire shelves have a black plastic coating which has a nicer look. All in all, I was not happy with the Newair. I would not buy it again.", "id": "2686328011"}

{"review": "I ordered this unit after sending another manufacturer's \"Beverage Cooler\" back. A product that will not cool beverages below 45°F, even after 7 days, has no business calling itself a beverage cooler. Wine may be fine at that temperature but few people in the U.S. want to drink a soda or a beer at that temperature. I did much more research before ordering this cooler and I am glad I did. I placed the order Sunday night and by Friday afternoon it was delivered, all the way from California to eastern Tennessee in 5 days with standard shipping. The packaging was good with the product's original packing box inside a second larger box with foam corner pieces to create 2\" space around the inner box. The cooler looked just like the pictures on the site and there was no damage to the product. Within 12 hours of setting it up the inside temperature was down to 34°F. After adding 40 .5 liter bottles of water and a dozen 12oz cans, all at room temperature, it took about 24 hours for them to cool down to 34°F. If the drinks are already cold, no problem keeping them that temperature, even with the cooler fully loaded. Just follow the directions and don't block the air flow. The unit is very, very quite. Bottom line is this unit does what it is designed to do for a good price. If you are looking for the same type of cooling capability as a full size refrigerator, I don't think any of the \"Beverage coolers\" can match that, but they are not designed to. For what this unit is designed to do it does it very well.", "id": "2686328011"}

{"review": "I received a NewAir WCD-200W Water Dispenser from the company in hopes I'd share my candid opinions on my social media outlets (for the sake of transparency.) I gifted the unit to my father for his 'Fan Cave,' because he is a very picky, an avid, water drinker. He likes his water to be highly filtered and can detect even the most minute of odors and imperfections, especially if they are from the lines or units transporting water. I mention this because one of our biggest triumphs with this unit was that it did not 'flavor' the water in any way during the dispensing, heating, or cooling process. It did, however, have a bit of a rubber odor emanating from the power cord for several days after unpacking. Setup was easy- If it has been shipped to you you will want to let it stand, upright, in it's intended location for at least 2 hours prior to plugging it in. This is a good idea with any appliance that cools or refrigerates (I didn't do this once, and a company wouldn't honor a warranty, so be mindful of instructions.) Then you may install your water bottle, full, in 2-3-or 5 gallon sizes. Keep in mind this unit is pictured with a water bottle but does NOT come with one. You can buy one from inside most grocery stores with water refill stations outside. Our 5 gallon bottle was $13 in California, full. Next plug in the unit and turn the hot/cold on. Pull water through the hot water dispenser to allow for air flow, and let the unit cycle 30 minutes before beginning the simple cleaning process. To clean the unit (I suggest every 3 months or 3 bottle changes,) turn off the hot/cold, unplug the base, and remove the water bottle. Next, draw water from both the hot and cold nozzles until they are empty. Then, unscrew the drain cap in the back and collect the remaining water from the reservoir. Note, we had an issue with the water spurting straight out from the unit during this step, so make sure the container catching the water is angled, and you are not pointed towards an electrical outlet. Once the unit is drained you my repeat the setup process an enjoy your unit. Here are some of out favorite features: *The hot water gets very hot- it steams within seconds and makes a great cup of instant cocoa or coffee. It has a safety (pinch) valve so it cannot be 'tapped' on. You may run the heating or cooling elements separately as the seasons call for to save energy. *The unit can be run without power as a room temperature water dispenser. *The small storage cabinet has a magnetic strip around the border to keep the door closed. *The drip drain can be removed and cleaned in two pieces. *The unit is generally more quiet than the standard aquarium pump, and cycles after cold dispensing (so there is not a constant cooling fan noise.) *It's actually more attractive in person and fit out decor quite well- my father keeps a small house plant on top, haha Minor Issues: *While it says it's Energy Star certified, there was no estimated cost to run (yearly) anywhere, so I have no idea how efficient it really is. *The back drain plug builds enough pressure for the water to spurt outward 2' when draining and can make mess or be a hazard. *Doesn't come with a bottle- you will have to buy one separately.", "id": "2686328011"}

We tried everything, reread instructions, etc. You can only set it on a dial, there no indication of what the temp actually is...so we bought a thermometer and got the bad news that despite being on the coldest setting possible, we weren't getting below 49-50, which according to the thermometer we bought is actually in the \"danger\" zone of letting bacteria breed. So, we call the manufacturer who says that we should have know it is a \"cooler\" not a fridge and will only keep beverages 20 degrees cooler than the ambient temp in the house. What a crock!!!!!!

{"review": "This new model thermoelectric cooler from Whynter is a real gem. I am a white wine drinker, and enjoy my wine at a temperature of around 48-50 degrees Fahrenheit. Most thermoelectrics do not cool that low. Many are not even specified to go below about 54 degrees. This Whynter Model WC-201TD is specified down to 46 degrees. Upon installing the wine cooler I set it to its lowest value. With the wine cooler about half full with standard 750ml bottles, it slowly made its way all the way down to the specified 46 degrees. I was impressed. Not only that, the Summertime afternoon non-air-conditioned temperature at our house over the next 24 hours hit 80 degrees. The Whynter easily \"kept its cool\" between 46-48 degrees. That's an impressive 32+ degree differential. Wow!

{"review": "I guess one could say that I'm a bit of wine connoisseur, but yet I've never owned a wine cooler. Okay, I'm not the type of connoisseur that will pay thousands of dollars for a bottle. I guess that's more the collector's route than the taster's. But I digress.... This Whynter model is perfect for me as I never have more than 15 or so bottles of wine around at a time. It has excellent temperature variations and I've found I like my wines at about 46 degrees. Does that mean I'm a wine snob when I'm that particular? :) This wine cooler is sleek and compact and I don't believe anyone would have a problem owning one no matter how space \"tapped out\" they are. This thing really does look elegant and fancy. I have mine in my kitchen and it really accents it because my is already silvers and blacks. I guess my only minor complaint is the unit makes a bit of a humming noise. It's just enough to be slightly annoying. My kitchen is next to my living room and when I'm watching television it can be a bit of a nuisance. Well, I've actually gotten used to it the last month.... I just turn the tv volume up ;) Overall, you simply can't go wrong with this Whynter 20 bottle wine cooler.

{"review": "I started drinking wine 20 years ago, and now believe that I am \"pretty good\" with my wines, and understand the need for temperature variation, shelf life, pairing, etc. (Heck, I'm a card carrying wine-club member at different Paso Robles wineries...LOL) My last wine refrigerator wouldn't get colder than 55. I didn't really mind, but when I had a really nice white, I'd put it on ice to get it cooler before serving. This refrigerator goes all the way down to 46 degrees! Awesome! That's PERFECT for my favorite wines. I'm pretty excited about this. The shelves are stable (maybe a tad lightweight, but you can't overload them). They pull out, but you have to have the door \"all\" the way open. That's a good thing. No accidental shelf-removal or knocking. The outside is all black, and the door has brushed stainless edging. It looks nice, but mine had a few small gouges in the stainless. It isn't a big deal to me, because of how it's placed in the kitchen, but if its placement were higher, and I had to look at it every day, you can't miss it. (But seriously, this is nitpicky.) The light is really elegant. I love it. Perfect for a nightlight, too. The display is blue, which matches all of the other displays in my kitchen. There are two leds in the back, inside the unit, but they shine through the grates. Odd, I thought...one is green, one red. I'm sure that they serve some purpose, but I'm not sure what. The controls are very easy to use--press up for warmer, down for colder. Not real difficult. The Whynter badge was off center, and I'm not a fan of badges...but it was super easy to remove, and the excess glue cleaned right up with glass cleaner. It looks slick now. It has leveling legs. This is cool. I have had a few wine refrigerators, and haven't had this before. It's very easy to level. In all, this is a winner. It was unpacked and plugged in within 5 minutes of its arrival, and chilled down to 46 in no time. I was really impressed at how quickly it took the temperature down. It's full now, and looks fabulous with the light on :) Follow up: I downgraded my review by one star (5 to 4) because I noticed that this refrigerator is loud. My last one had a wood casing, and you could never hear it. This one is definitely noticeable when it's running. It's not a big deal, but if you are like me, and get distracted easily when trying to study, you'll notice. The red light coming from the backside is a little annoying, too.

{"review": "I've been using my Whynter Thermoelectric cooler for about a week now, and I am not sure how I got along without it. Wine tastes better when it is kept at the proper temperature, and having a few cold bottles lying around (without taking up precious refrigerator room) is amazing. I also store Pellegrino and sparkling wine so it works as an all-around cooler as well. The Whynter has a sleek, tinted mirror all-glass front with a tiny metal trim that looks incredibly sophisticated and modern. There are three buttons on the front, two temperature controls and the light control, in addition to the Whytner label and the digital (blue) temperature read out. This cooler has an incredible temperature range - all the way down to 45 degrees - more than other coolers out there. That's super nice because not all wines need to be in the 50s and 60s. The interior light allows you to see through the mirrored glass into the cooler, which, in addition to being useful, adds a sexy glow to the kitchen. Nice for entertaining. The cooler only took a few hours to reach operating temperature and, according to the thermostat I have kept inside, maintains a very steady temperature. The cooler can hold 20 standard wine bottles and the racks feel nice and sturdy while also being removable. The racks don't, however, try to come out with the bottle when you pull a bottle out, which is very nice. I can also fit a bottle of sparkling wine, though it does slightly kick up the shelf above it, but not so much that I can't fit bottles on the shelf above. My only complaint is that it gets a bit noisy when it is cooling. It hasn't been terrible and it certainly isn't louder than my refrigerator, but if that ever-present background noise irritates you, you might want to rethink this particular model. Otherwise, very nice.", "id": "2686328011"}

{"review": "A wine refrigerator is a useful tool to have if you plan on aging any fine wines. This unit is attractive and compact for the number of bottles that it holds. Nice features include a tinted glass front door (for keeping UV light out), easy-to-read temperature gauge reading and setting right on the front door, internal light and sturdy shelves. As with any other inexpensive compact wine fridge (based on reading other product reviews), in some ways this one is no different. It's designed to hold 20 standard/Bordeaux-style bottles. As soon as you start getting bigger (Burgundy, Champagne, and definitely not a magnum), they probably won't fit. The tapered bottles of a Cotes du Rhone and a Barolo in my collection were tight but I was able to get them in. My biggest complaint and my reason for removing a star is that the refrigerator has a hum/buzz when running. It's never \"off\" though it does ramp up even louder when first turned on or when re-cooling after the door is opened. It's not overly loud, but the frequency (centered around 750Hz) I find very annoying, to the extent that I will probably unplug the refrigerator if I'm going to spend any significant time in the room. It may just be the way thermoelectric cooling works and sounds. A friend's refrigerator (different brand) makes a similar hum but is much quieter.

If I pull it out from under the bar so it is sitting out in the open it cools down to 42 degrees. After reading the owners manual it says to not put it under a counter or in a cabinet. To \"leave it freestanding out in the open\". It is an under counter refrigerator!! Unfortunately it is the only one I could find that fits the space made for it so I have had to do extensive modifying to the wall and cabinet to install a fan to hopefully move air away from and across the compressor.

Not much to my surprise they have the same basic design and compressor (same Chinese manufacturer) for anywhere from $45-65 more. A really good unit is going to cost $400 or more.

{"review": "Just received this device. It seems to work well. What is nice is that you don't have to connect it to a USB port on a PC or laptop if you don't want to. It works with most powered USB ports that put out 5.0 V DC. The user manual is not real clear on how to power up except to plug it in and it starts working. My unit came with a rocker switch in the cord with three positions. I, 0, and II. 0 is the middle position and the unit is off. When I moved the switch to the I position, it blew my 1 amp blade fuse that is on my DC power distribution that supports two USB power ports. In the II position, the unit works just fine. I would be careful using the I position in a PC or laptop USB port as this might cause damage. The packaging (box) states there's on-line support but no URL listed, nor any mention of manufacturer or country of origin on the box or user manual (no labels or stickers on the unit either).

{"review": "My ceiling fan remote just stopped working on my UC7083T. Like others, I went to Home Depot to get a replacement and they only had universal remotes, so I bought their $29 one.

Well, I get home and the remote doesn't even have dip switches or anything else programmable and needless to say didn't work...returned it next day with packaging all messed up and all (that's what they get). I started looking online and most sites that had original Hampton Bay UC7083T remotes all cost around $30. Then I found this, which was $10 +shipping at the time and took a gamble that it would be UC7083T compatible. I was pleased that it was.

Plus, it uses a common 9V battery, not some mini-size battery that's easy to confuse with similar ones. If you didn't bring the battery model #, you could easily bring home the wrong one. It's a little bigger control, but much better design. Also comes with a 2-screw wall mount, so you can always put it in the same place when not in use.

{"review": "UPDATE 4-29-2014: I can now verify LED candelabra bulbs work with this fan (and remote, see notes). Installed 7w (60w equivalent) Utilitech dimmable LED bulbs in the fans. Working/dimming great. No flicker, and FAR brighter than the incandescent bulbs provided. Not quite as bright as the 60w equivalent CFL's, but these are dimmable! Can't show a verified purchase as my wife bought them through her account, but we've got 5 of these fans in and they're great! There were a lot of questions and reviews mentioning that a CFL bulb doesn't work. They do! If you look at the latest manual on Hunter's website, it is now missing the note about using CFL's. I've got 60w x2 candelabra bulbs running without issue, though I am also using Hunter's remote control unit which needed to have the dimming function disabled (model 99122). Also, these are by far some of the easiest fans I've ever installed due to the hanging system allowing you to wire without holding the fan motor up at the same time. About 45 minutes start to finish taking your time and they're in! Pros: -Very quiet -Easy to install -Works with CFL bulbs (again, see notes above) -Move a LOT of air Cons: -Candelabra style socket on bulbs -Every fan had a bit of wobble to it on high, but easily fixed with included balance kit", "id": "495362"}
{"review": "Ordered this fan using my Prime account. Arrived on time and had it installed in a couple of hours.

Small wobble when fan is set to high speed, but medium is perfect for my use, which cools a small office room. It replaced an older, cheaper Hampton Bay and it is so much better. Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to most. I'd have given it 5 stars if not for the high fan speed wobble.", "id": "495362"}
{"review": "This fan is incredibly quiet with barely a noticeable hum when on at full speed. The fan moves a lot of air at high speed. The finish is well done and the blades look very nice. The fan did have a wobble which was easily corrected with the balancing kit supplied. The Amazon product photos are a good representation of what you will receive. Assembly is very easy and the instructions are fantastic (anticipate about 45 minutes for installation). The parts come well packaged. The hanger makes installing the fan easy, and there is sufficient room in hanger/bell to mount any remote controller that you may want. The light is not white, but a toffee color (not a minus, but do be aware). The light only has two lamp holders (almost a minus), so you will need additional lighting if your room is large or uses darker wall colors. For the price, this is a fantastic fan. Be sure to pick up a remote control if needed as this unit does not include one (Lutron makes some very nice ones.)", "id": "495362"}

This fan went up really easily, they have improved the process from fans just a few years ago. My fan was missing the little rubber thingies that for one of the blades, but I was able to steal them from the fan we took down. I did notice in the instructions that this fan should not be used with CFL bulbs - odd since I think incandescent bulbs of over 60W are being phased out - that might be why this fan is so cheap. It also only has two spots for light bulbs (120 watts maximum), which is one fewer bulb than our previous fixture, and IMO, not enough light output. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a >$200 fan that supported 180 watts.", "id": "495362"}

{"review": "As all the reviews have said this is a quality Hunter fan which is easy to install. The installation would have been even more of a breeze had we not discovered the existing ceiling box was attached to a hanger bar that was too small to support the fan. Since finding the ceiling box in the attic under blown in installation would have been difficult if not impossible we went to Home Depot and found a retro-fit ceiling fan safety brace for $13. (Description : This Westinghouse Saf-T-Brace allows you to safely install your ceiling fan or lighting fixture in three easy steps--without having to access attic space. Ideal for installation during new construction or remodeling, this mounting brace can be put into finished ceilings through a 4-in. hole. This brace works with all ceiling fans, so you do not have to worry about size or compatibility. The brace's three teeth easily twist and lock into the ceiling joists, its threaded multiple lead adjusts quickly, and its square tube allows for easy turning. For added ease, the electrical box can be positioned anywhere on the brace to fit your project needs. The brace works with existing ceiling joists between 16 and 24 in. wide. The Saf-T-Brace comes with everything you need for installation, including easy-to-follow instructions. It also includes a Saf-T-Cap to protect bolts and wires during drywall installation and painting.) Once the new ceiling box was installed the fan went up easily. There was a little wiggle in the fan, but was easily solved with the enclosed balance kit. The fan runs so quietly and smoothly the pull chains which hang beneath it don't even move. The glass light shade is a little darker than the picture but almost matches the glass shade on a floor lamp in the room. I'm very happy with the fan and its appearance.", "id": "495362"}
{"review": "This unit was easy to install in a new fan. The receiver fits inside the shroud around the drop rod holder. There are little switches in the receiver and the transmitter that have to be set the same, but it allows up to 16 remotes to operate 16 fans without interference. The transmitter requires a 9V battery that is not included. There are 5 wires that need to be connected, two to the AC input hot and neutral, one to motor hot, one to lamp hot, and one to both lamp and motor neutral. For the remote to work, the fan pull switch has to be set to the fastest speed, and the lamp pull switch has to be turned on, then the remote just takes over.", "id": "495362"}

All the above issues I could have ignored had it worked longer than a month. But I'm back now looking for a different remote and thought I'd write a review to warn others.

{"review": "General install is easy enough, and the light control is great! Directions aren't very good but if you have any electrical knowledge you'll understand fast enough. One of the fans is switched and the light setting \"sticks\" even when killing power via the switch to the control unit which was a nice surprise. Basically it works like this: 2 hot leads in your fan, one for the light, one for the motor. Take the hot that used to go directly to them, run it to the controller marked for supply (red) White supply to white on same side as hot supply. White out to white for fan and light. Black out to the fan Blue out to the light In my case there was a black and a black w/white stripe in the fan (tied together) to the house current (hot). I think the white stripe was for the light but it depends on how it was wired so just trace it through the fan stalk (disconnect the light off the bottom and see what's in there, should trace all the way through the \"stalk\" to the top in the canopy). The colors on the controller and the colors in the directions don't match, but it's marked on the controller which lead is which, so like I said anyone with any electrical experience can figure it out. I saw one almost identical to this at the big box store with a brand name on it, but it cost about $40. Looked exactly the same except maybe the color. Fit in the canopy was tricky at first, and the first one I did (I have two) took me a while to figure out how to get it in there - FWIW these are flush mount fans (Hunter), not hanging. Don't forget to set the codes!", "id": "495362"}
{"review": "I installed this with my Hunter SummerBreeze, and although it does what its intended to do, I have a few issues. First, the blue wire for lights is pre-stripped, but if you're like me and did not have a light, you won't use it. Unfortunately, that wire is \"hot\", and I got an unpleasant shock when I was doing my final testing of the power. There's no indication that its on, but the exposed wire can give a nasty surprise. Second, my range has been inconsistent, I can't tell if its interference, but in some cases a press will register immediately and other times, it takes multiple presses. Because the fan changes speed slowly, going from a low to medium, you might not even be able to tell if the button press worked for 10 seconds. It's easiest to go from 'off' to a speed to ensure it registered. Third, I had an issue with the battery initially, I installed my 9v battery and the light on the remote stayed on all the time. I thought maybe this was normal at first, but after popping the battery out and back in, the light only comes on with a button press like you'd expect. Overall this remote does what you'd expect and is a great value and easy to install, albeit with a few quirks.", "id": "495362"}

{"review": "The wall control works great but, as others have said (for this model and the previous WC212), when the power switch is on, the built-in LED backlight is unbelievably bright in a dark room (e.g., a bedroom). If this were in a kitchen and you wanted a night light, this would work OK, but in a bedroom or a rec room where you may watch TV in the dark, it is just horrible. I was able to figure out where the LED light is and disable it, however, so while the backlight will never work again for me, that's fine and I no longer have to cover the darn thing up with electrical tape in order to sleep at night. I'm not having luck getting pictures up, but here's written instructions for disabling the light. It looks worse than it is -- about a 10-15 minute job total, including wiring it back into the wall. 1) Turn power circuit off and disconnect the controller from the wall. 2) There are 4 screws that hold the metal mounting bracket on. Unscrew them and remove the bracket. You technically don't need to do this but it makes the remaining steps easier. 3) There's a tab in each of the four corners of the back of the control. Using a small screwdriver to push those in and remove the back cover. 4) There are three screws that affix the back circuit board to the faceplate. Remove those, which will enable you to simply pull the back and faceplate straight apart. The screws are not the same sizes, so keep track of which you remove from where. 5) Looking at the back of the faceplate down where the switch slides, you'll see a small section of the circuit board with two gold dots -- that's where the LED light. You need to access the other side of it, however, so remove the clear(ish) plastic piece that covers the switch -- with a little work, you can slide it out. 6) Turn the faceplate over so that you're looking at the control buttons. Looking at the circuit board through the switch slot you'll be able to see the back of the area specified in step #5 -- that's the light! I just used a small eyeglass screw driver to scrape out the light/connection. Once that's gone, no more light! 7) Put the plastic switch cover back in and then reassemble that parts you took apart. Wire it back in the wall and you're done! This obviously ruins the LED light for good but for those that dispise it (like me), it's necessary. If it weren't for this huge design flaw I'd give the controller a 5-star rating. If I weren't able to figure out how to disable it I would have given it 1-2 stars. 3 is the most I can give it. Hope the above steps help. I'll continue to try to get my pix loaded.", "id": "495362"}

I use them much more often than the remote that comes with the fan, which is annoying cuz you have to store it and then go find where you put it, etc... I am old school, meaning I do like having the classic switch on the wall and then having the remote is an added bonus for when you forget to turn off the lights/fan when already in bed. :) Perfect balance and highly recommend. Also, I read many reviews about the \"night light\"... seriously, I am not sure what people are complaining about. It's a small blue LED light and its NO WHERE near being intrusive or annoying.

{"review": "The control pad is dominated by the fan control. Unfortunately, the equally important light on-off buttons are tiny and thus relatively hard to hit. Also, the dimming control is poorly thought-out. Regardless of which button you press (the smaller on button at the top, or the slightly larger off button below), the light always starts to dim first. Why not brighten if you press the on button, and dim if you press the off button? Also, once you reach either max bright or max dim, the cycle doesn't stop there. The dimming/brightening function then reverses direction. So you have to be quick to release the button if you want max brightness. The on-off buttons also operated oddly. You'd think that pressing on would turn on the light, and pressing off would turn off the light. But in fact, you can press either button and the light will turn on if off, and off if on. So what's the point of having two separate buttons then? Minka Aire could have made just one large button for light control. Tap for on or off. Press and hold for dimming/brightening (although I would prefer a rocker switch style so that you can select either dimming or brightening). At least the blue night light is at an appropriate brightness. It is no brighter than say a small 5mm power indicator LED on your typical electronics. The downslide is that the blue light is located at the bottom slider switch, instead of backlighting the light on/off buttons. It is baffling as to why Minka Aire chose to backlight the slider switch, which is probably the least important switch, especially at night. it's a shame that the Minka Aire Concept II ceiling fans require this product if you want a wall switch control. I would have preferred one of the many Decora ceiling fan switch controls that are available, which have much better ergonomics.", "id": "495362"}

{"review": "I bought this remote for use with a Hunter 53091 fan and it works flawlessly. I installed the remote receiver at the same time as I installed the ceiling fan, so I don't know how inconvenient (if at all) it is to remove the base cover to install. The wiring is very straight forward and the instructions are clearly written for installation and syncing with your fan. The safe exit function is a nice thing to have, though I doubt I will ever use it as the room I've installed it in is small enough for me to make my way out without tripping or hitting anything. But I have verified that the function does work, and without issue. The dimming function is also nice to have. The only way I could see to improve this is to have separate buttons for dim and brighten. The way the command currently works is like this: You hold down the light button... the lights gradually dim in steps until it reaches the lowest point, and then gradually brightens back up. This function is fine, though, it would be nice to be able to just dim or brighten without having to go to the lowest/highest point before being able to go in the other direction. Not entirely convenient, but not worth losing a star over either. The best part about these... obviously, the convenience of being able to control the fan/light without having to move from wherever you are. But, it converts a single switch into a dual switch; allowing you to control the light and the fan separately, without the need for 2 wall switches. I would recommend this remote to anyone without hesitation. And I will undoubtedly be purchasing one of these for each ceiling fan I add to my home.", "id": "495362"}

{"review": "Works fine. Looks fine.My problem is you can't use it with CFL lighting to adjust settings from dim to bright. You only get to turn it on to one setting, which is what ever your bulbs are. Incandescent bulbs work to adjust the lighting . If I used them I would give it 5 stars but that is a lot of energy wasted. There are three fan speeds and they all work as you would expect the speeds to be. No problem there. You can also hook it up on top of your wall switch to turn things on and off or take it out of the holder and carry it with you where you want which is nice. As a side note pay attention to the amount of energy the fan takes for your bulbs. There are only two bulbs in the fan I used and the CFL bulbs were equivalent to 60W and it seems dull lighting to me. There is a limit on the fans how much energy they take from the bulbs. Some have three bulbs and take 180W some 120W max etc...Something to keep in mind if you want a lot of light.", "id": "495362"}

{"review": "TWO important notes about this fan. First of all, I love these - we have two installed for residential use and they have exactly the modern/industrial look we were going for. Looks exactly like photos. Other reviewers have captured the good and the bad. Here are two observations that I didn't immediately find in other reviews: 1) 1970 called, and it wants its fan control back. SERIOUSLY. The fan control, aka the switch that makes the fan turn on and go 5 different speeds, is a throwback. It's like mounting a VW bus to the wall. Take a look at custom photos to see what I mean. NOTE: the good news is that others are available! Search Amazon for 'westinghouse fan control' for better options. HIGHLY recommend, for ease of install and appearance, that you go with one of these instead. But hey, maybe you miss the 70's and this is your ticket to disco, swinging, and blow. I'm not judging. 2) DO NOT install around children or in any situation where someone might hit their head. This is an industrial fan made of metal. Even at low speeds, it will hospitalize you, I'm quite sure. Careful.", "id": "495362"}
{"review": "Usually the more stylish, the higher the cost. This fan is a refreshing exception to that rule. Looks great, easy to install. It comes with a rather clunky, space-consuming wall-mounted remote. Because the switch governing the ceiling outlet in my place lives in a triple-wide switchplate, I bought an aftermarket ceiling fan control for $20 and installed it in the existing junction box. I also cut 4 inches off the downrod, as it hung a little low in the room. This required drilling two new holes in the rod to slide the pin through, a minor operation. Only glitch was that the thing wobbles some on the top speed. I tried switching the blades around in the head, and after two combinations it runs like a gem, with no vibration whatsoever. Highly recommended! I'm buying a second one for my office.", "id": "495362"}

{"review": "This is actually a very elegant fan once installed. The product photo doesn't reflect this, but it has a very nice slender profile and sensible design. The color is actually a very reflective brushed metal finished- from a short distance it looks like chrome, so if you are into a retro modern look this does work acceptably. Unlike alot of modern fans that have blades made out of dissimilar materials and need superficial balancing, this fan has metal blades and seems very solid and well-balanced. It isn't quite as silent as some of the other fans in the house- it has a quiet \"choppiness\" and doesn't flush mount. It also has a large box that provides the multi-speed control with a somewhat vintage Westinghouse look to it.

I turned the dial and nothing happened. Then I switched to \"FULL\" and the fan turned on. I guess to get this to work you have to switch to \"FULL\" first and then to \"VAR\" with the knob all the way up. Then, you turn down the speed gradually.

{"review": "I've had this fridge for about two weeks now and it's been really great. I bought it for my office and mostly to prevent me from eating out, so I had a few criteria. First, it had to be fairly small footprint, but large enough to store a good amount of real food, such as leftovers, some fruit & veg, and materials to make snacks with such as PB&J. Second, it had to have a real compressor, one that will cool well below the ambient temperature as the office building gets quite warm in the summer and I really hate when food goes bad. Third, I didn't want the unit to give up a bunch of space to a can delivery system, since I don't drink usually have canned drinks around. So, that's how I ended up at the SPT, it's the only one I found that fits all these criteria. I'd never heard of SPT before buying this fridge and quite honestly, if it had the same features as all the other fridges I'd seen (researched for two weeks), I probably wouldn't have bought it. However, given that it had everything I was looking for, I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. First, the aesthetics; it's a vertical rectangular shape, modestly attractive looking, basically it looks like a small black fridge with a stainless door. I was a bit surprised at the size, it's quite a bit taller than I was expecting and the black does makes it look a little monolithic. The unit actually looks bigger than it really is, I was shocked to find that it fits nicely under my desk. The Stainless Steel finish on the door isn't quite as polished as the vastly more expensive full-size GE fridge I've got at home, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it looked, especially considering the price! This unit is solidly built and is surprisingly lightweight, which was great for moving it around the first day, figuring out where it should go. The door, as shipped, opens on the left, but it looked like a fairly simple job to switch sides (haven't needed to) and SPT included extra plastic inserts for covering up the holes should this be required, a nice touch. Door was protected with plastic film and all three shelves and the ice maker were taped down to prevent them sliding around. On to functionality; the fridge works! It got the four iced teas I put in it ice cold within only a few hours of being plugged in and I've got the unit set at 4, the factory preset median setting and it works great. Stuff down low in the fridge was kept nicely cold, the ham I put up near the icemaker had frost in the package, but the meat wasn't frozen. Note to self, meat goes lower in the fridge. The lower door shelf holds four Honest Tea bottles, but the wire holder swings out to hold bigger items. The top door shelf is a little shorter and has a fixed bar, so PB & J go up there. Inside shelves are made of white plastic-coated wire and well spaced. The freezer holds at least a trio of standard sized juice boxes; it's wide, but not very tall, so low items work best. One other extremely cool thing is, the energy consumption rating for this fridge is actually below the lowest range on the chart. This makes it extremely efficient, which isn't a factor for me, but I can see this being a plus for someone being challenged about its power consumption. Given how well it keeps my food cold, it must be very well insulated to achieve such low consumption. Things of note: 1) This unit only has one leveling foot, at the front right corner. This is probably not a problem for most people, but my office floor is as flat as a Ruffles potato chip, so levelling the fridge required shims under the front left foot. 2) Power cord is only about 5Ft long, once again, not a problem in most offices, but I would really have liked a longer one. Extension cord to the rescue. 3) Unit isn't silent, but it's not loud either. Some people have complained about other fridges being loud, I don't find this one to be unpleasant, it's like low-level white noise in the background. If I get in early, I can hear the fridge, but once the office wakes up, it's inaudible. 4) Unit came very well packed in an enormous box, strapped and taped closed. I was impressed, but I did have to lie the fridge on its side to get it out of the box. 5) This hasn't been a problem, but the manual says that should the fridge lose power, it won't come back on automatically.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "Length:: 0:50 Mins This turned out to be the perfect refrigerator and I'll try to answer some questions about posted concerns. Noise - when you first turn on the fridge and perhaps the first 24 hours, the refrigerator will cycle quite a bit and the compressor will make interesting noises. not bad, just different. once the refrigerator has had it's break in period, the compressor only turns on every 30 minutes or so for a very short time - I don't notice it anymore and the compressor is not loud at all. How soon after the item is turned on that you can place things inside - within two hours the refrigerator will be cold - however, placing warm items in there will require additional times for the refrigerator's temperature to level out - it's been that way ever since they have been making refrigerators. The stainless on the door is beautiful and we are delighted that we spent the extra money - it looks great in our office - see video.

{"review": "After my son was born, we wanted a mini fridge for the bedroom so that my husband wouldn't have to run downstairs to get milk out of the fridge in the middle of the night.

We typically have around 12 fraps, 15 bottles of water and one or two bottles in the fridge at all times with room to spare. Some people have complained that this fridge is loud but I don't agree. Whenever the compressor turns on, of course you can hear it, but it's not very bothersome and doesn't wake up our baby despite being 5 feet away. The stainless finish looks good and doesn't seem to get fingerprint smudges which is great. I want to point out that the description of the product is incorrect.

FIVE MONTH UPDATE (7/21/14): This fridge & its freezer still work so efficiently and quietly, that the two of my colleagues who lobbied the most persistently against my purchase from Amazon, have joined Amazon Prime's 30-day free trial, and each now enjoys this SPT in his own office.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I bought this to put under my desk at the office. It fits perfectly and cannot be seen by others. What I love the most is what I don't have... noise. Unlike my last minifridge the unit operates very quietly and keeps items appropriately cool. I was surprised to find that the freezer compartment actually keeps items frozen.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I bought this fridge a couple weeks ago and it looks nice in person, came very nicely packaged with no effort needed to put it together. The inside smelled a bit at first of plastic but I left the door open for a couple days and the smell went away. After I plugged it in, it got very cold after just a couple hours and keeps cold well. My biggest complaint is the noise. For the most part, it's quiet in the maintenance mode but when it is turning on to cool itself, it makes loud clanking sounds that I can hear from my second floor and I have the unit on the first floor. I researched other fridges and seems like noise is always an issue so I guess this is a decent fridge if you can put up with the noise.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "FIRST UNIT FAULTY, SECOND PERFECT: The first unit I received had a noisy compressor that would make a metal \"clunk\" sound every time the compressor turned on or off. The compressor still worked 100% in terms of cooling temperature, just was noisy. I had the first fridge for 5 months and decided to see if SPT would replace it because the 30 day Amazon warranty was long gone. SPT told me they would repair or replace it if they found a problem even though in their warranty it says different. This fridge is under manufacture warranty for 1 year from the purchase date. Luckily, the SPT warehouse is in City of Industry, CA, which was close to me so I dropped it off. SPT had it for 4 days, called me and said they couldn't repair so they would send me new one, shipped it for free. Turn around time was 7 days which is pretty quick in my opinion. Got the new one and it is super quiet and did not make any \"clunk\" sounds. The repair tech even took the new fridge out of the box, switched the side the front door hinge is on, and packed it back up. Functionality: A packed fridge will get very cold especially on the highest setting \"6\". 3-4 setting still works pretty well. Freezer is small as others have stated. It will 'almost' freeze large items. Small items like burritos or breakfast sandwiches will freeze normally. A small tray of ice cubes will freeze. A bottle of alcohol will get to the temp you need it. IS IT QUIET? Yes! I realize the idea of how noisy a product is, is subjective. I'm very sensitive to noises when I sleep and this unit did not wake or keep me up. The unit is about 10 ft from my head. You can hear when the compressor comes on, but it is very minimal. If you have this in an office or an area where people are on phones you will NOT hear this. HELPFUL FEATURES: The door hinge can be placed on either side which was helpful for me. You have to manually change it though. Instructions included on how to do that. Pretty easy to do. You basically move the hinge from one side to the other with some screws and bolts, and the door will swing open which ever way fits best for the owner. RATING: I debated giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Even though the first fridge was faulty, SPT stood by their product, plus the fridge is quality, does its job well, looks sharp, and is at the perfect price point. It deserves 5 stars. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: If this fridge is going into a poorly lit room, I highly recommend buying a cheap, battery-powered motion sensor LED light and stick it to the top of the fridge using some double-sided tape. The one I purchased for my fridge is on eBay for $6.26. Just copy/paste \"8 LED Light Lamp IR Auto Sensor Motion Detector Energy\" into eBay search bar. Any questions feel free to ask.", "id": "678542011"}

{"review": "I was looking for a small fridge for cold drinks when we moved our full size Fridge out. After reading reviews of competing brands, I finally down to this SPT: What I like: 1. Contrary to what many have been saying that it makes a lot of noise or maybe I was lucky to get a good one. I could hardly hear the sound coming from this unit. Validating those reviews I have read about the noise it makes, only when I tried to get near to within two feet, that's when I heard some blower low sound, similar to some laptop fan white noise. I waited until the compressor started to kick in, surely, there's a diff. sound a rumbling sound, that's only when I tried my best looking for the sound. Once I took my concentration somewhere else I couldn't hear a thing. It's not a noise, it's a whisper. 2. I like the stainless steel look, it made it look pricey and clean. 3. I couldn't believed what ready-to-eat food that can fit inside other than soda. It can fit a two Chinese quarts size containers on the top shelves, a foot long Steak Sub, three layers of seven bottle of beers side by side on the second level and 10, 12oz soda can on the lower level where the compressor is located. The door can accommodate full size water bottle. 4. It have a small freezer that can fit a sandwich size item or an ice tray. 5. The size is very small for a fridge but big for a counter top. 6. Great for basement to compliment a dry bar or just something to reach in while watching a TV/movie or just feeling lazy to go one level up/down to get a drink. Remain to be seen: 1. See how long it will last. 2. See if age will make the sound louder. If there's a need for small dorm type fridge, this is the one. UPDATE: Aug. 24, 2014 ************************************** 1. Noise - Since I moved this fridge in a more isolated man's cave, at around 7 feet away, I hear the compressor more pronounce. There's a click followed by motor sound for 20 seconds then start to fade to a hum white sound)for total of two minutes and a click at stop. Repeat every 6-7 minutes. If you are focus on the sound then it becomes annoying but ignored it and it disappears. 2. Still going strong. 3. For almost the same price I paid, for those who needs a dedicated freezer, the 3.1 cu-in with two doors, top freezer is a better buy, I believed. Size-wise, more room and it's not much larger. I still maintain to recommend this if this is the size you're looking for.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "Bought the first one but was DOA. Amazon quickly sent out another one before we shipped the defective one back (Great service Amazon!!!). Unfortunately, the compressor in this unit is very noisy (it is for a wet bar in our AV room). We have placed Styrofoam on the floor and placed this atop the Styrofoam. The noise lessened considerably but still quite present. I may try to find a way of mounting the compressor on some rubber standoffs if I cannot find a better solution.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I wanted a refrigerator that would get really cold, was black and had more room than one with a freezer which I knew I would rarely use. So, based on the good reviews I purchased this Danby DAR195BL 1.8 cu.ft. All Refrigerator - Black. This compact fridge is very nice. I wanted to mostly use it for drinks, and some lunch stuff/snacks and quick meal items like a carton of eggs, salad dressings and cheeses/luncheon meats; maybe a loaf of bread. They went in with room to spare. The slots for soda/beer cans and my once a day 9.5 oz. bottles of iced Starbuck's Frappucino are nice, everything slid in perfectly. Plus it fits a 2-liter bottle of soda in the door or a quart of milk and a quart of orange juice. Nice 11\" depth on the top 2 shelves but items can overhang by another 2\", so ideal for leftovers or take-out. Only the bottom shelf is shorter, about 6.5\" deep. But so far great! And when you get the temperature dial just right and figure out where to put the soda cans so they get a bit of a freeze on them, you get a heavenly cold drink on a hot day. Although you can't tell from the pictures, the top of the fridge is not just a shiny flat metal top but instead is a scratch resistant work top that overhangs the door and has a slight depression to it. This means that if you open a can of soda and accidently knock it over the liquid won't run down the sides or into the door crevices but stays on top where you can clean it up easily. At first I wasn't sure I would be happy with those 6 can slots in the door but soon realized that other things would fit in them too. Right now I have a package of Vienna hot dogs and an onion in the top 2, but often I use these for fresh fruit or yogurt cartons. Just make sure to keep things like fruit at the top if you have the fridge temperature set low or they may freeze. The AC plug is a \"flat to the wall\" type so the cord(measuring 6 feet 3 inches) runs against the wall instead of sticking straight out. This means you can push the fridge quite close to a wall. This is a small feature but one I like a lot. The outside dimensions are approximately 20\" high x 17.5\" wide x 19.5\" deep. The fridge has a drip pan which is about 1.25\" high and doesn't rest on the floor but is securely screwed into the back of the unit about 6 inches off the ground. My unit has never leaked any water, the drip pan is always dry when I check it. No matter where you buy the fridge it comes only in factory packaging which is not very protective. However, neither this unit (nor the replacement I ended up needing) was dented when I received it. (*** ---> If you don't want to read about all my woes with getting a bad unit, skip down to the UPDATE section ***) So, that's where the good part ended. It was supposed to be quiet according to most reviews. So I waited a few hours before firing it up (as was recommended) then plugged it in. To my dismay, when the compressor came on it was pretty loud. But I shrugged and just thought it needed about 24 hours to cool itself down and figured it would adjust itself. Well, that didn't happen. It sounds like a mini airplane running it's engine all night long in my bedroom(I've got it set about mid way on the dial). I can even hear it in the living room, over the sound of the television. It makes a constant humming sound at a pitch that just can't be ignored. And we have moved it to different locations/positions too, to try to get it to make less noise but to no avail. The left side also gets VERY hot while the compressor is running. I love everything about this little fridge but the noise is driving me crazy. I've turned down the dial to a less cool setting to keep the compressor from coming on as often, but now my drinks aren't nearly as cool and refreshing. It's kind of ironic though, because I read a comment about the Emerson 1.8 Cu. Ft Compact Refrigerator (not currently available on Amazon but sold by Target) which is also supposed to be very quiet. That person said his fridge sounded like an \"airplane overhead\". So I'm thinking this is a quality control issue with these type of fridges or possibly cheap Chinese compressors. Maybe it's just the luck of the draw if you get a quiet or noisy one. At any rate, I'm thinking maybe I got a defective one, because no one has complained of noise like this. I plan to call Amazon and get a replacement. I'm just hoping that I WILL actually get a quiet one. I really don't mean to discourage anyone from purchasing this unit, because I REALLY like it. But I did feel I should point out how noisy mine is, because maybe they're not making them as good as they used to or maybe they are now being manufactured by another company. Don't really know, just very, very disappointed. UPDATE 4/3/12: Noise Problem Resolved: Contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement fridge which is great. It's VERY quiet and is warm, not hot, on the sides when the compressor is running. Did have a wobble but was an easy fix. With the dial set to 3/4 my coffee drinks are freezing cold at the bottom level in the door and the back of lower shelf. Need to do a bit more fiddling with the dial, or not. I'm definitely keeping this one! UPDATE 5/12/12: Fridge still running great and I still love it. Holds so much stuff. UPDATE 6/14/12: The back of the middle shelf is the coldest shelf in the fridge as it sits directly in front of the cooling element. With the temperature dial set at a little past the 3/4 mark, food can freeze on the middle shelf. Once you're past the 3/4 mark on the dial the areas with the greatest freeze potential are anything closest to the back of the middle shelf with the exception of the top shelf. The top shelf is the warmer of the 3 shelves; hot air rises physics I guess. Fridge working good and I'm still amazed at how much stuff it holds. UPDATE 8/7/12: As I know that people look for compact dorm fridges to send their kids off to college with I will just mention that this item is also sold by Home Depot but may not be available online. $109 is a good price if you can get it for this fridge. That's about as low as it ever goes, except for one day in June, 2012 went it hit $101 on Amazon. UPDATE 8/7/13: I've had this fridge a year and a half now and am still very happy with it. Just to update you on the alternate Emerson 1.8 Cu. Ft Compact Refrigerator which I bought at Target at the same time, it also is still running well and is quiet. But, the fridge door was left slightly open once and the entire freezer compartment turned into a brick of ice. In the process of removing the ice the freezer door hinge broke off and can't be put back on. Also, the thin wire retaining bracket that hold things in the lower door section is too flexible and we often have problems with bottles or jars slipping under them and out onto the floor. I think it's a decent fridge as it is also quiet, plus it can often be found on sale for about $60, but it doesn't hold nearly as much despite being the same size because the freezer compartment takes up too much space. It keeps things cold enough but will not ice my beverages like the Danby does. To those that have read that the Danby makes noise I do not believe that this is specific to this manufacturer and I advice those buying any compact fridge to make sure you know the return period(30 days with Amazon), set it up and test it DURING THIS PERIOD, and to NOT settle for one that seems too noisy for you. If it's noisy it's defective, simple as that. Let them pick it up and send you another one or two until THEY get it right or you just don't want to deal with it anymore. Best of luck! UPDATE January 2014: The price on these units is usually at least $109, since December, 2013 they have dropped to about $96 (likely only a seasonal drop) UPDATE 4/1/14: I've had my fridge two years now(the replacement unit) and it is still working well. It's still quiet, keeps things very cold, and hasn't developed any new problems. Very satisfied.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I'd read some reviews on other sites for this model about how lots of people had to adjust the temp because their drinks were too cold (or even freezing). Since that's how cold I want my fridge to be able to cool, I bought one. The other reviews were right! The unit is advertised to keep a temp that's 40 degrees cooler than the surrounding temp. I can testify it does that and more. I have this in in an office environment at work, which is always near 70 degrees. The first time I got this fridge running it cooled down to the high 20's - my drinks were partially frozen and undrinkable. That means this fridge is capable of cooling to a little more than 40 degrees than it's surrounding temp. Perfect! I merely adjusted the temp a little so now it hovers around the low 30's. That means I can depend on my drinks being ice-cold. The knob for adjusting the temp is in the back, so it's a little hard to reach. But fortunately it's near the top, so you don't need to pull out the fridge to reach it. You just have to crouch down all the way and reach over the top. I work in southern California where it's now in the 90's outside, so it's aweseome when I'm hot and sweaty to be able to open up my fridge and pull out an ice-cold drink. I'm actually going to buy another one for home! The only problem I had is the first one arrived defective - didn't cool at all. The vendor arranged a UPS pick-up (fortunately I'd kept the packaging - it was dead out of the box) and within a few short days the replacement unit arrived. It's worked perfectly since.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I purchased this fridge to go in our bedroom. Sometimes at night especially in the winter with the dry heat my hubby and I get thirsty and don't want to go all the way downstairs to the kitchen to get a drink late at night. I looked a several models and reviews and decided to purchase this one in spite of the fact that some reviewers were complaining about a noise. Well unfortunately, I think I got one of those. The instructions say to let it sit at least 2 hrs after unpacking before you plug it in (I guess to make sure that the compressor oil is settled)and I let it sit for about 4 hrs. When I plugged it in, it made its normal fridge start up sounds and began cooling. It took about 3 hours to initially cool my drinks inside. I love the can holders on the door. My little 8oz drink cans fit perfectly and I was also able to put 12 19.9oz bottles of water inside. The noise happens when it cycles on and off to cool. I was ok the first night, but by the second day it began to also whistle (I guess this was the airplane noise customers described) while it was on and it got louder and very annoying. It cools great but neither my husband or myself could sleep that night because it was so annoying therfore, I had to send it back. I don't think I want to try another one at this point to see if it works better, I'm just going to try another type I was also looking at.", "id": "678542011"}

{"review": "Updated 9/21/13: This little refrigerator has been running faithfully for 2+ years. I purchased it in June 2011 and am pleased with how well it maintains its temperature. I selected this unit because it uses a compressor rather than semiconductor technology which, from what I've read, is not recommended for ambient temperatures >77 degrees. This refrigerator can really get cold: My room is 80 degrees now and I have the temperature dial set to the halfway point just to keep items in the door from freezing solid. This unit has two shelves and a \"can rack\" in the door. The top shelf at its highest setting is just high enough for a carton of eggs and deep enough for two cartons. A portion of the bottom is sacrificed to the compressor in the back but, overall, this refrigerator can hold a lot. The can rack can be used for condiments, yogurt, etc. And the space in the door next to the rack will hold two quart-sized milk/juice boxes. Just be careful not to block the vents in the back of the compartment because the back wall will ice up and the refrigerator will shut itself off. This happened to me but, once I unplugged it and let it thaw out and then plugged it back in, it came back on. Pros: - COLD. - Energy Star. Economical to run. - Nice unobtrusive black finish. - Efficient use of interior space. - Compressor cooling. Cons: - Not loud, but may be a little noisier (because of the compressor). I am pleased with this refrigerator and recommend it highly.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I bought my Danby fridge back in late April 2013, and unfortunately just two months after, the unit stopped working. While it worked, the fridge was able to keep things nice and cold. It wasn't too loud for an office environment and it was great having my own fridge at work. But that's where it all ends. The compressor was making noise, and the seal on the front door was loose (causing the door to just pop out at random). I contacted Danby customer support, since I was outside my 30 day Amazon return window. At first, they (Danby) seemed like they were more than willing to help me with getting a \"refund\" on my refrigerator. I've never heard of a company that was willing to just issue you a check rather than just exchange a new fridge for you. But hey, whatever works for them. It takes their general customer support about 72 hours to realistically respond to you. At which they ask you to provide all the information about your unit, such as serial #, photo of barcode, etc. Standard procedure, that's fine too. I waited another 72 hours. I follow up that the unit needs to be picked up from the shipping address on the Amazon invoice. Another 72 hours later, I then get a response that a UPS Pick up was scheduled. I figured, they have my receipt from Amazon, they would pick it up from the shipping address like I requested. I emailed back, and found out they had set it for my billing address. Okay, a little bit of miscommunication/assuming on their part, let me tell them to switch it. Their answer? No. Its your fault. I quote from the service rep Chris: \"Your [item] should be at the billing address, so that is where it needs to be.\" EXCUSE ME!? Both my invoice and my email correspondance confirm that the item needs to be picked up from the shipping address, not the billing address. So I ask again, and forward the correspondence that I sent about confirming that the pickup should be from the shipping address. This is response I get: \"Hi, I've taken this to my Supervisor (we aren't able to cancel Return Shipments with UPS). It seems that you will actually need to return this unit to Amazon.com directly. We will not be processing a refund or picking up the other unit.\" You're joking right? You can't cancel a Return Shipment with UPS? I WORK WITH UPS and I know for a fact that Return Shipments can modified at NO CHARGE. It's a simple phone call to make the change. And they're telling me I have to contact the retailer to support a two month old product? Nevertheless, I called Amazon.com support and as always, they were courteous and worked with me to get the issue resolved. I filed a formal complaint against Danby and I hope they will get their act together to properly support their products.", "id": "678542011"}

If you turn it up all the way it will be like a freezer if that's what you're looking for. Be warned though; mine had a small dent from being shipped. Like some other reviewers said. Your packages don't seem to be handled carefully during shipment, maybe the seller should add \"Handle with Care\" and \"This side up\" on the package. Anyway, my dent is small enough where a dent remover can get it out. Do not turn it on for at least two hours when you get it or else it could fail on you from being on it's side and all during shipping.

{"review": "I read the reviews and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, the fridge was extremely noisy as many have said and the compressor heated up to the extent that three sides of the fridge were hot to the touch. I cannot recommend this product.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "Let me start by saying I really wanted this fridge because of the positive reviews and the fact it doesn't have one of those useless freezers in it. Love the look of it - it has a plastic-like coating on the sides and door, and the top has a tray plastic cover that you can actually put stuff on top of it, not that I will. This plastic does not show finger prints and gives it a modern feel, actually doesn't look like a fridge because of the finish, and only the door handle and shape gives it away. The built in defrost tray is a plus too! If you've ever owned any other compact fridge the defrosting is a pain in the rear because of the freezer and the flimsy drip tray under it. I would bet that most people wait like I did until the freezer compartment is so deep in ice that whey you do defrost them the cheap plastic tray ends overflowing, kind of like you are trying to catch a roof leak with a thimble. Operation - is a little loud when the compressor starts, but settles down to a low hum, not too loud at all. The sides will get a little warm when it is first turned on, but on normal cycling on and off will get much less warm. This little beauty cooled right down, I have the temperature dial half-way and the my fridge thermometer in the middle of the middle shelf and it reads about 31 degrees - I like my pop at about 33 degrees so I am close to where I want it. Having the temp control at about ¾ of max setting was reading 15 degrees, so this little thing can cool well. I like the pop can holders in the door, I may drink both canned and plastic bottles, the 12 ounce cans are nice for late afternoon when you don't want a 20 or 24 oz soda. The door is reversible - another plus - and most of these 1.8's cannot have the door reversed. You will see that the manual and other reviewers say the temperature control is in the roof on the inside, but it really is on the back of the fridge on the top right corner. I suppose Danby decided since some people put these on the floor that it'd be easier to adjust from the back vs. kneeling down to adjust. So for those of you who plan to tuck this under a desk, you will need to pull it out to adjust the temp. Also this item has 18 months warranty, with an additional two if you register online, really a longer warranty than the other ones I looked at. Delivery - here's the thing...Took me four attempts to get a fridge that was not damaged. It is shipped in the retail packaging with a label slapped on. This is fairly standard practice seen in other larger items I have received, BTW. The guys in the white trucks delivered the first two. Boooooo. The first one was dropped HARD on it's back corner thus bending up the frame the compressor sits on. Some holes in the side of the box but no visible damage to the fridge where the holes were. The box appeared to have been through a tornado. Most people probably know this, and maybe some of you don't, but your compressor is supposed to sit LEVEL for best operation. Okay, #1 went back. The second one was delivered and it had been dropped on the back corner where the compressor was but not as hard as #1; the top corner of the box and was torn open. This one must have been through tornado #2. The door did not open without hitting the bracket and plastic top, and it had a dent in the temperature control on the back. I fired this one up and it cooled for a while but was not to the temp I wanted, so I tried to push the temp to be cooler and the fridge would not come back on until we plugged it back in again (note as stated before there was a BIG dent in the temperature control box). Back it went. The guys in the brown trucks did better. #3 looked perfect when it came in by the condition of the box on my front step. Upon unpacking I found that it too had been dropped and had the worst damage of all to the compressor bracket, like they had dropped it on something dead center of the bottom of the fridge. Although #3 was damaged, the box was in much better shape and appeared to have been handled decently other than the drop. I didn't even attempt to plug this one on and sent it back. I had sworn I was going to stop at three tries but I soldiered on for a fourth. So #4 - success! The box just had some rub marks, no major holes, and it works! Thanks guys in the brown truck! Now all freight carriers will damage freight and this is a heavy, bulky item, and this is not an easy item to move. I had two day shipping with Amazon Prime, and I will agree as other reviewers have said that faster shipping versus the standard ground shipping would be best for this item. Still, it should not have taken four tries to get an undamaged item. I hope this helps!", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I purchased this frig for office keeping cream, soda and lunch. I was not too sure how cold and how load this frig will perform. My purchase decision was made based upon the comments posted. I give this frig 5 star rating based upon the following reasons: 1. It cools down very fast and is able to keep everything cold, better than all the mini frigs I have used. There is a temp adj in the back and mine is at 80% range. 2. No freezer section to take up space, so the two racks are deep enough to fit 12\" pizza box. Maybe because no freezer section, temp is very even insidet the frig. 3. It operates quitely. I placed the frig on top of a bookcase about four feet high so there is nothing to block the sound. I am impressed by how low the sound it makes. 4. Energy consumption is estimated at $32 a year which is fairly economical. 5. If there is any improvement I would suggest is the option to configure the soda can holder on the door to regular self so folks can store salad dressing, pickle jar alike items. If it continues to perform at this level for two more months, I will buy another one for upstairs study at home.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "I really like iced apple juice, but the ice was melting before I ever finished my drink. I was going through apple juice like crazy, but never really drinking much of it. I bought this personal fridge to cut down on wasting apple juice (don't like it all watered down from melted ice). It works so well, that I can fill a 12oz glass with juice, put in a few cubes of ice, and seven hours later, the ice has not melted. Think about it...seven hours! If I leave a glass of ice and juice out for 30 minutes, the ice has melted down to little bitty bits and the juice is too watery. I used the \"Mastercool MSC52224A Infrared Thermometer in Case with FREE MSC52220 Analog Thermometer\" that I bought from Amazon to check the temperature performance. The manual for the mini fridge says that it is capable of cooling to 32 (deg F) below ambient. I checked it on a hot day, a warm day, a cool day, and several times between using the digital IR thermometer and it is consistently 32-45 degrees cooler inside the fridge than the outside temperature. Even on a 90 degree day the ice did not melt and I didn't have to replace my drink. The inside temperature at the warmest spot was consistently hovering around 45 to 47 degrees (F). My drink was at around 36 to 38 degrees, depending on where I measured it. On the days that were around 70 degrees, this fridge read temperatures close to freezing. In fact, I was amazed when I pulled out a frosty glass of apple juice. It happened only once, but still...worth mentioning. I think the trick to getting this to work optimally is to provide several inches of space for the back end where it vents out the heat. I used the thermometer there as well- the vent on either side exhausts at about 90 degrees (F) but at a low volume so it is not very useful as a space heater. The unit runs quiet- very quiet. It comes with both an AC adapter, and a DC lighter-socket adapter for the car. The power switch has three positions- Off (middle) to the right is 110AC, and to the left is 12VDC (car). There is a single green LED to indicate ON operation, there are two warm air exhausts on each side at the rear, and two cool air intakes- one at the back plate, and one on the top at the aft end. This is why ventilation and spacing is important- due to the proximity of the hot air exhaust and cool air intake- there needs to be room for the warm air to dissipate and not be drawn in by the cool air intake. The manual says 6 inches space all around, I've found that about half that works in my situation. I have not tried a six-pack, or tried using it in a car. What I can say is that if you like to have a cold drink handy to sip on all day while you study, this unit is worth every penny. I have not had to waste a glass of juice because it was watered down since using this unit- for that, 5 stars easily.", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "The reviews seem to split on two issues - is it noisy, and does it cool effectively? If half the reviews were right, it seemed perfect for my desk, because I need a way to have drinks (cold soda, or hot coffee with milk) without having to stop for a long trip to the cafeteria. So, I took a chance. First, on cooling: I think some people are confused about how a thermoelectric refrigerator works. \"Normal\" refrigerators cool food by cooling the air and blowing it around with a fan, or in some cases by cooling all the interior walls. Since the air and walls have a low thermal mass, refrigerators work BEST when they're mostly full of cold items. So, in general you want to keep them full or almost full, and in small ones if possible you want to pre-cool the items before putting them in (unless you have a lot of time available to remove all that heat.) This refrigerator has two zones - a metallic surface from the back to about 2/3 of the front, and a plastic zone at the last 2\" near the door. The cooling ONLY occurs through conductivity at the metallic surfaces, so that's where you want to put milk, dairy products, etc. If the refrigerator is full, the food near the front will be cooled by contact with the cold food in the back, and by the cold air between all the cold foods, but it won't get as cold as the food in the back. I think that's what's causing the \"this isn't cold enough\" reviews - the sodas and milk I put in the back are VERY cold. (I think they designed the fridge for cans to lay on their side, so the back and front wouldn't have different items. But that won't work on anything but 12 ounce cans.) Now, about the noise: Very annoying and loud whine. It uses what looks like a cheap, noisy 80mm square computer case cooling fan, 20mm thick, drawing 0.15A at 12V. There are many much quieter fans out there, but that thickness is hard to find, I just ordered a much quieter 25mm thick one, and I think there's enough clearance that it will work fine. I also ordered noise-suppression screws - the whole thing was less than $10 plus shipping. The important thing is that the replacement fan can't draw more current than the original. Will it work? Stay tuned - I'm going to update after I put it in and, if it does, I'll give the model info and some assembly tips. (If it doesn't work, I'll learn to live with the noise.) Update 3/8/13: I just replaced the fan with a quieter one, and the fridge - which still cools very well - is now totally silent. I'm changing the rating to five stars, based on how cheap and easy it was to do this. I sit about five feet away from it in my office, and I can't hear anything at all now. Before, the noise was a steady whine that I sorta kinda got almost used to, but now that it's totally gone I can tell from its strong absence that it was an ever-present annoyance. Seriously, I have to check the light to make sure this thing's on. So, here's what I did: I bought a Coolink SWiF-801 80mm Quiet Computer Case Fan from QuietPCUSA (online), which sold it for $4.95 plus shipping. (In Amazon, searching for that model brings up a $30 alternative.) There are many other fans and other vendors to choose from, but any you pick should be (1) 80mm square, no more than 25mm thick, (2) DC12V and a MAXIMUM of 0.15A (the one I bought about half that amperage), (3) specifically rated as quiet - this model claims 11 dB, and (4) have reasonable airflow and RPM (this one claims 38 cubic meters/hour at 1500 RPM.) Frankly, you might do better but at five bucks and near-total silence (vs office background) it's hard to justify the effort to try. I'm not a super-DYI guy, but I got a couple of small wire nuts, a small flat-head screwdriver, and borrowed a wire stripper. The back comes out with eight small screws. The fan comes out with four small screws. The new fan's cable had a connector at the end - I cut it off, cut back the outer sleeve and exposed a couple of inches of the wiring. The yellow wire can be ignored, it's for speed control and the Koolatron's original fan - which I removed with a small flat-head screw driver - only has a black and a red wire. I cut off the original fan's wire and very carefully cut into the wiring insulation to expose the thin metal wires inside. Then I pulled on the insulation with my fingernail, exposing about an inch. Did the same with the black and red wires in the new fan, stranded the like-color ends together, bent the exposed wires in half, connected them with the wiring nuts and then screwed the fan back into the back. I'd bought \"anti-vibration fan screws\" but they aren't suitable for the Koolatron case, so that was three bucks wasted. I cut out four small squares of thin rubber and placed them between the fan and the case, using the screws to make a tiny gasket. (Chances are, that's not necessary, but I'm not taking it all apart to check.) That's it! Just two wires and twelve small screws, about fifteen minutes if you've ever stripped a wire and used a screwdriver. And, man, is it quiet!", "id": "678542011"}
{"review": "This little \"backup\" fridge keeps 6 soda cans very cold. The look is pretty neat. My main quibble is with the latch mechanism. It's a little plastic thing that I'm afraid will break because it takes a little bit of guess work to figure out wither to pull or turn to open. (It turns.) It's perfect for a small conference room, but I'm just afraid that after long usage someone will figure out how to break it. I guess time will tell. OK, three years later my little buddy died. The handle broke and had to be glued back on a couple of times. But finally he gave up the ghost. So much for my private stash of sodas at the office. I got my money's worth.", "id": "678542011"}

A single 16.9-oz bottle of water will only fit inside sideways, and will take up all the available space. I keep it turned on 24x7. The fan noise is very low (think White Noise).

In fact, it is taking 1/2 the power of my _old full size freezer_ to cool down the equivalent of one six pack. It's not like it gets to a specific temperature and stops. When you turn it on, it stays on and the motor/compressor is running constantly. Not only is this expensive for a micro-fridge, but it will cost you $$$ just to run. Get a real mini-fridge.

{"review": "I had a smelly refrigerator that came with the apartment I am renting, so other tenants have used it. It smelled like fish, ammonia, and other horrible smells despite how many times I cleaned it or attempted to deodorize it with baking soda. Everything I put in that thing had this distinct, pungent odor when I pulled it out after awhile. The odor particularly leeched into plastic bags and containers and coffee grinds. It reeked! While the odor didn't make my food taste bad, whenever I pulled out something I had to hold my breath to let the smell dissipate so I wouldn't loose my appetite! Even then, the odor still lingered and was still detectable. It was that bad. The odor was in the freezer too, and it made my ice have a distinct, horrible taste. I had to drink lukewarm tap water and anything in a sealed container in the refrigerator, because the odor would dissipate into open containers of liquids and spoil their taste. So, I had no ice for quite some time except if I bought a bag at the store! I had originally heard about putting newspaper into a refrigerator because the ink contained absorbing carbon and the paper itself absorbs odor rather well, too. I did that and noticed a difference after a few hours. I then researched better options and found that activated charcoal is more effective. I looked on Amazon and found these Whirlpool activated charcoal boxes specifically designed for problems like mine. I got the box for the refrigerator and the one for the freezer. I highly recommend you do that, because air mixes into both compartments of the refrigerator. At first I didn't notice much of a difference, but it was slightly better after the first night. I followed the directions of the freezer absorber box and changed out the ice every day. That helped, but what really helped was throwing away my old ice cube trays after a few weeks when the overall smell had dissipated, because I noticed the plastic tray itself had absorbed too much of that horrible smell. I got new trays and put them in after about 3 weeks of having both absorber boxes in the refrigerator. It worked like a charm, and I now have a nearly odor free refrigerator! It doesn't smell like it used to at all, but it may have some more to go. It was really smelly. However, I can now put open liquids in both freezer and refrigerator compartments and they do not taste bad at all! It's amazing! If you have a stubborn odor in your refrigerator, get both the ice cube and refrigerator odor absorbers! You'll be amazed at how well they work, and I suggest throwing away your old ice cube trays because these odor absorbers cannot seem to get odors out of the trays. I highly recommend these! You will not regret this purchase!", "id": "678542011"}

I'd seen something on TV about how charcoal works really well in refrigerators, so I looked on Amazon and found this little gem. That was a year ago, and we've hardly had any smells since then. I actually forgot that we had it (it's tucked in the back in the most inaccessible spot), and I forgot that refrigerators get stinky. Our butter has no extraneous flavors, and if we set something uncovered in the fridge for a while, it doesn't become funny tasting. But now it's gotten where I can detect a smell in the refrigerator every now and then, so I remembered about my charcoal deodorizer and realized it's WAY past time to replace it! I think a typical user can get much more than the stated three months of usage out of it. Maybe don't go quite as long as we have, though.

{"review": "There was no significant benefit over baking soda using this product. Baking Soda refrigerator boxes cost $0.82 at Walmart. They are good for 30 days. These units are suppose to be good for 90 days. $0.82 x 3 = $2.46 v.s. $9.00+. In my opinion these items didn't do anything more than the boxes of Baking Soda that I had in the refrigerator and freezer prior to purchasing these. I would NOT waste the money expecting any significant results! I used the products for (3) weeks and returned them because I still had smells in the frig and freezer. Baking soda, oatmeal and vinegar (all used at one time before I came across this great product (sic)) were more effective in removing smells than this product. Now that the smells have been reduced (all prior to using this product) I'm sure baking soda alone will be more than enough to maintain a fresh smelling environment. I expected this product to rid the entire environment of any odors since the baking soda, oatmeal and vinegar combined had pretty much taken the strong odors away. I still had a lingering light odor remaining that this product did nothing to combat. Thus my conclusion that it wasn't effective and wouldn't be more effective than baking soda alone.

About 1/2 of the door is designed to hold 12oz soda/beer cans, so if you don't have any, some space may be wasted. With all the shelving pulled out, the surfaces are pretty even and easy to clean. Temperature adjustment is a simple knob. Seems to cool pretty quickly, and accidentally setting it too cold demonstrated that it had no problem freezing things. Hasn't apparantly struggled with the occasional 90 degree day. In a shared office with half a dozen people, running computers, etc, it's virtually silent except for a half a moment of quiet whirr and gurgle when it comes on a few times an hour. Door is easy to open from the top-mounted handle and looks reversible. Magnets stick to the sides, but not the front. Top is sturdy enough to stack other things on.

{"review": "Packaging: As some have noted, around the edges of the fridge there's not much padding, so I can see how it'd get dented if those handling the package were a bit clumsy. Luckily, mine unwrapped in perfect condition from as far as I can see. The one confusing part is there was a \"corner\" piece of black plastic that at first I thought was a cracked off corner of the fridge, but a quick inspection proved me wrong. The manual has a nice breakout diagram of all components internal and external, and not seeing this piece in that diagram, I can only conclude that it was simply a packaging device meant to help stabilize the unit within the packaging during shipping. Size: The fridge is 27\" high as advertised. Fits great under my office desk furniture - the bottom of the desk to the floor is 28\", making it a perfect fit. It's barely larger than a small letter-sized filing cabinet. Noise level: There's a very low humming sound as you'd expect, but it's not very loud, and barely noticeable when there's other ambient noise, even low volume music in the office. No complaints here. Function: I plugged it in at 9:30am this morning, and by 1pm, I now have two cases of cold Red Bull. Pretty efficient! Other notes: I wish there were more height positions for the shelves. There are only 2 slotted positions for the lower half-shelf and 4 slotted positions for the upper full shelves. The slots are fine for cola cans, but red bull cans or water bottles are just a little too tall, which essentially has you adjust the shelves to where the top shelf is very tiny or you just remove one of the shelves entirely.

I took it out of the box and set it up where I wanted it and I really was impressed with the actual interior size of the refrigerator part and the fact that it had glass shelves. The freezer is tiny, probably won't hold more than one Hungry Man tv dinner, but that is the norm on these. It comes with a little ice tray also. After waiting 24 hours or a bit longer I plugged it in and thought it would take a bit to get cold, but within the hour it was nice and cool. It will hold a gallon of milk plus a 2 liter on the bottom part of the door, or 2 gallons of milk on the very bottom interior. The next shelf up is a little higher than a soda can and it holds a 24 pack on that shelf. The next shelf is a little higher than a pound box of butter and it would hold 3 of those across with room to get your hand around it. The top shelf you can move the freezer tray up so you can get more space if you need and it is about the butter box size plus a margarine box laid flat on top. I don't have a ruler handy so I thought common items would give an idea. It runs fairly quiet. If I am sitting near it in dead silence I can hear the cooling fluid run through at times or a gentle hum, but it is not something you hear a few feet away. It wouldn't bother you in your dorm room for example. The only con I could find to the whole refrigerator is the metal rods you use to hold the pop cans and milk jug in will come out on you if you are not fairly gentle. The milk jug one is the very worst. I recommend finding something to hold it in better. I used a bit of that stuff that looks like blue gum you use to hold up posters on your walls that doesn't leave a mark. Its not the best fix probably but what I had on hand and its working thus far. Haier should make the rod a tiny bit longer to prevent this issue. All in all though, I am very happy with my purchase and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking at a small refrigerator with tiny freezer. Great for small RV or camper replacement and also for dorm room too. Thank you for reading my review, I hope this helps someone.", "id": "678542011"}

{"review": "I've been a fan of induction burners since I purchased a Max Burton 6200 Deluxe 1800-Watt Induction Cooktop several years ago—at much greater cost than it's listed for now! Nothing beats the precise temperature control, the safety, and the efficiency of an induction burner. They are far safer and more sophisticated than hotplate-type burners for college dorms or residences for the elderly or disabled. They are also wonderful for an office kitchen or to use outdoors or on a table for Japanese hot pot cooking or fondue. Induction cooks by transferring heat to the pot itself, which then cooks your food; induction-ready cookware must be used, but you probably already have something suitable (see below). Let me get the one thing I like better about my Max Burton out of the way first: it has a timer for auto-shutoff, which is a great boon when doing pressure canning using my Fagor Duo 10-Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner. When the canner comes up to pressure, I can set the timer for how long to keep it at pressure and then walk off and leave it, knowing that the burner will shut off and the temperature instantly be reduced to zero after that precise amount of time. With pressure canning, especially, timing is everything. So is auto-shutoff if you're easily distracted (like me) by other things. The Nesco does not automatically shut off unless it overheats, in which case it will shut off as a safety feature. That said, I like the Nesco induction burner much better for everyday cooking and will probably keep my Max put away until I'm canning. The design of the Nesco is sleeker and easier to clean, and it's MUCH easier to use. The Max has three different functional levels (wattage, temperature, cooking time) and up to ten different levels of settings within those functions; it's hard to see precisely which function you are changing settings for, and once it shuts off, you have to go through the whole rigamarole again if you want to keep cooking at the same level. (Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep! Beep beep beep! Beep! Beep!) The Max Burton is 1800 watts as opposed to the Nesco's 1500 watts. That sounds good until you trip the circuit breaker every time you use it with something else plugged in if you don't take pains to lower the wattage to a non-default setting. The Nesco, on the other hand, is simplicity itself. For many purposes, all that needs to be done is just press the On/Off button, then the Cooking Mode button, which autosets at the center/default Boil (C3) setting. The five cooking mode settings, printed on the front panel and shown in large red digital letters when in use, are self-explanatory and controlled by two buttons (Up and Down): Melt/Warm (C1), Simmer (C2), Boil (C3), Fry (C4), and Sear (C5). The Up and Down arrow buttons do just what you'd think: Up cycles up from Boil to Fry to Sear; Down cycles down from Boil to Simmer to Melt/Warm. The temperature adjusts instantly, so you get practically instantaneous feedback on your cooking level just by looking at what the contents of your pot are doing. If you push the wrong button and \"go the wrong way,\" you can just push the opposite button and take it back to \"where you meant to go,\" which will never be more than four button presses in one direction if you're going from the very lowest (C1) to the very highest (C5) or vice versa. Finding induction-ready cookware is as easy as taking a magnet with you to the thrift store or into your cupboards; Nesco thoughtfully provides a weak magnetic strip that you can tuck into a pocket for that purpose. (Be sure to stick it to the bottom of the pan, not the sides, because the bottom that comes in contact with the burner is what counts.) Cast iron definitely works, but (as with ceramic cooktops) you have to be careful not to scratch the cooktop with it. The bottom diameter of your pot or pan must be between 3.15\" and 10\" in order to work; larger skillets can cause overheating. All of the pieces of my Rachael Ray Stainless Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set, Orange work with this burner. I love it.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I've owned a Max Burton 6000 induction (1800 watts) for over 2 years; it's a much better option. I mainly use a portable induction burner for cooking outside; if you are cooking something stinky like deep frying oil or it's summer & you're craving pasta but don't want to warm up the kitchen or you're grilling and want to warm a sauce or side dish. We also like to use it on the deck in the summer for making pancakes. We eat breakfast outside frequently & it's really convenient to set it up on the table while cooking batches of pancakes. So to test this Nesco (1500 watts), we took it out on the deck to make pancakes. We use a Lodge cast iron pancake skillet/griddle. This skillet is 10.5 inches outside measurement/10 inches inside cooking measurement so should be a good test. To test the evenness in cooking, we poured pancake batter to near the edge of the pan, leaving a little space for turning. This Nesco did a terrible job at cooking evenly. Even though the circle (cooking zone) is 10 inches, the pan did not get hot enough to the edge so we had a gummy/white pancake & a very overdone center where the element is under the pan. We tried again, fiddling with the temperature level & making a small pancake in the center. That was better but this would be annoying to make 1 small pancake at a time & it needed constant watching/adjusting of the temperature. **See photo of pancake above. There is very little fine tuning in the temperature selection. You choose between 5 \"Cooking Modes\"; Melt/Warm, Simmer, Boil, Fry & Sear. My Max Burton has 10 cooking levels which I discovered is important if you're doing anything other than boiling water. On level 2 (Simmer) it is too cool and on level 3 (Boil) it is too hot; the food burns. Having only 5 cooking levels is not enough for items that need specific heat control. Even though the circle (cooking zone) is 10 inches, the pan did not get hot enough to the edge to cook evenly. With a strong backlight, I could see and measure the induction element; it is approximately 7 inches in diameter. When no pan is present, it beeps at you, a helpful feature. However, after initially beeping quickly at me, it behaved oddly and after I held a pan away from it for 30 seconds it never beeped. Either it wasn't actively heating (on level 2) or it decided not to beep. I started to question the beeping accuracy /effectiveness. I also tested it boiling water & in that it does a very good/fast job. So if you're just using this to warm liquids such as water, soup, oil for deep frying; it will probably suffice. If you want to cook something evenly, look elsewhere. Induction cooking requires a magnetic pan. To test your pans, put a magnet on the bottom. If the magnet sticks, your pan will work on induction. If it doesn't stick, it won't get hot & you need to choose another pan. A cheap refrigerator magnet is included with this cooktop. Handy if you're going shopping for new pans but most people probably already own a magnet or two so not really a selling point. Max Burton 6000 1800-Watt Portable Induction Cooktop, Black A much better choice. Lodge Logic L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle My cast iron pancake griddle; works great on other cooktops.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I bought this cooktop because of many of the reviews and despite some of the others. I found out very quickly with a refrigerator magnet in the house that my Enamel Dutch Oven is the only piece of cookeware in my entire house that sticks to a magnet. Let that sink in, I can only use this cooktop with my dutch over, there isn't enough iron or steel in anything else we own to use the cooktop. You should check your own cookware before you buy any of the induction cooktops. Now that that is out of the way, I've boiled pasta on this cooktop, made cheese sauce, browned meat, cooked bulgogi, boiled water, it does everything you ask it to. It has 5 settings, #3 is boil, then fry, then sear. The boiling water one might seem to take a while to you, but I suspect most folks boil on the highest setting and then back off so you'd probably go to #5 and then back it down when you had a rolling boil. It seems to take a long time to boil water, I think that has a lot ot do with how much thermal mass my dutch oven has. It is a thick walled 5 or 6 quart dutch oven. This has more iron in it than some of the induction cookware out there with thin plates of metal stuck to the bottom of them so a lot of energy is going into heating the pot itself, this is not ideal. The cooktop makes some fan noise while it is cooking and for about a minute after you shut it off. A minute after you are done, the cooktop is generally cool to the touch. If you go to heat something up and it doesn't detect a pot there it will beep and shut off. When I go to pour off the water after cooking pasta, it beeps and shuts off. The pot retains enough heat the pasta doesn't get cold and it saves me a step of turning off the cooktop anyway, but I could see this getting annoying if you were making eggs or chocolate and had to whisk something off the heat to keep it from scrambling/burning, then the cooktop shuts off on you. Anyways a good little cooktop so far and very easy to clean so far. Grease spatters are by far the biggest culprit, followed by pasta water boiling over if you don't watch it. May 21, 2013 Update I made a Bean Soup over the weekend, I had to get the water up to boiling, boil for 10 minutes and then simmer for 2 hours more. The cooktop perfromed flawlessly. Up until this point I had mostly browned meat and boiled pasta noodles so no more than about an hour's constant use. If anyone was wondering about longer duration cooking I hope this helps.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I love the Nesco induction cooktop! It's compact and lightweight, so it is easy to store when not in use. When it is in use, it's a dream! It heats quickly, much quicker than I expected. A small fan runs while it's on, and it barely makes any noise. The five settings are easy to select, allowing heat variations from simmer to sear. The buttons are easy to push, but are not touch sensitive. This is important since you wouldn't want to accidentally change the settings. The appearance is sleek, and it's easy to clean. I've missed using my cast iron skillet since I bought my glass top stove, which can be easily damaged by cast iron cookware and is not recommended. I can use the cast iron skillet on the Nesco without any problems. I suspect the surface of the Nesco will suffer a little from cast iron if I'm not careful, but it shouldn't damage it the same way as a glass top stove. It also uses much less energy than a regular stove, so it's cheaper to use in the long run. It won't replace my regular stovetop, but I do plan to use this regularly.", "id": "3741261"}

I took 1 star off because during this test, about 1.5 hours of use, for no reason, while control was at C1 in the 1st 15 minutes of use, the unit started beeping with error code E1. It's the same error code I saw when I put a non-magnetic stainless steel cookware on it. I turned the unit off and back again, and it functioned properly. And also because max usage is 1420, not 1500. I'm hoping that this unit is not defective.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I have this DUXTOP 1800-Watt Portable Sensor Touch Induction Cooktop Countertop Burner 8300ST which is an utter piece of junk. And this Fissler CookStar Induction Pro Portable Cooktop which is really really nice (and really expensive). So I did not expect this one to be good. Amazingly, it is quieter that most induction cookers and it works really well. You have to be aware that with cheaper induction cooker the heating area will be smaller. So that was expected. The one problem I have is that I can't find a setting for my pressure cooker. C2 was too week and C3 was too strong. It only has 5 levels. It works well if you happen to need exactly as much power as the 5 settings allow. But it will get frustrating when you need to be between 2 levels. Most other induction cookers offer more levels for this reason.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I love this cooktop! We BBQ at least three or four times a week and usually had to go indoors and use the stove for side dishes. We set up the induction cooktop right next to the BBQ and have used it two times so far with outstanding results. We use a heavy iron skillet which heats up amazingly fast and the heat stays consistent. Its light which makes it easy to bring outside whenever we need it. This is my first time using an induction cooktop and I am so pleased that we were offered this product to review. It is so much easier to keep the kitchen cool in the summer with out the stove and oven on. Highly recommended for outdoor use, excellent for camping and a boat or RV. For those who have never used induction before (like me) you must use a metal pan such as cast iron, magnetic stainless steel or carbon steel. You can not use copper aluminum or glass.

{"review": "My new hobbit kitchen does not have a cooktop, oven, or any appliances, just a counter, sink and cupboards. This cooktop is adequate for my needs with a little shuffling when cooking two or more things for the same meal. You have to get stainless steel or enameled steel cookware, induction safe. Take a magnet to the store when you shop. This cooktop doesn't get hot, but it makes the pan hot by magnetic force somehow and the pan does the cooking. In the two weeks I have used it, I notice that it cooks fast. I don't use levels 4&5. Level 3 is good to boil water and cook meat. The simmer is sometimes too hot. I think I will adjust in time. If you need a burner, this is nice. Easy to clean, too.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "This was my first time using any kind of portable cooktop and I found the experience to be a mixed bag. On one hand, I love how lightweight and portable this is. I head up a breakfast club at my work and since we don't have an on-site stove I loved that I could use this for preparing breakfast there. It's easy enough to tote back and forth from home (even on public transportation) or if I choose to leave it at the office, takes up minimal space. But, the cooking experience isn't as good as using a range. As others have mentioned I definitely missed the fact that the burners weren't used to what I have at home and the slightly uneven temperature. The latter was actually the bigger burden of the two because it was noticeable even using it with high quality quality cookware known for heating evenly. Because of this, it has taken a little adjustment to learn how to cook well with this portable cooktop so I personally wouldn't use it straight out of the box for a big or important meal. I'd recommend playing around with it a little bit first.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "The cooktop seems to work fine, but don't assume the Nesco magnet included with the cooktop is a foolproof way to test cookware. I have a set of tri-ply stainless steel cookware that the thin Nesco magnet will stick to, but that cookware doesn't work with the cooktop. When I called Nesco to ask about it, the company rep confirmed that with some cookware the magnet will stick but there isn't enough iron to work with the cooktop. At the same time, she continued, there is also some cookware where the magnet won't stick but there is enough iron for the cooktop to work. Although it's probably not foolproof, either, I suggest ignoring the Nesco magnet and using your own. When I used a heavier magnet the results seemed to be more reliable. One final and minor observation: the box advertises that the cooktop is \"Ideal for kitchens,...and outdoors,\" but the sixth \"Important Safeguard\" in the owner's manual states: \"Do not use outdoors.\" I guess their marketing people and their lawyers don't talk to each other.", "id": "3741261"}

{"review": "Bought this unit for home canning. Unit came with a nice heavy power cord, power indicator lite that shows when the heating element comes on and an easy to adjust temperature control knob. I used this with my presto 23 qrt. canner and a 28 qrt. stock pot for heating my glass ware. It brought my canner to a boil in 13 minutes. Virtually the same as my stove top. I used a watt meter to track the current draw during use. It pulls 1425 watts and 12 amps. Its advertised as 1500 watts so its missing 75 watts some where but I don't think that small amount matters. Nice finish on unit which makes for easy clean up. Seems well made over all. I didn't care for the hard plastic legs as it tended to slide around the counter top when placing or removing a pot. If I was going to change one thing, that would be it. The whole unit tends to get hot but not unreasonably so since a wide pot forces the heat out around the bottom so it has to go some where. This is a nice addition to any kitchen weather for canning or just having an additional burner for cooking a large meal. I already ran it for many hours with no problems. Time will tell how it holds up in the long run.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I've had Broil King hot plates in the past and they've been just great. Ordered two of this one because it has an 8\" burner. But Broil King cheaped out on the power on light. The on-off switch does not have an indicator light (the rocker is painted red when the unit is on). The burner-on switch cycles on and off as the solenoid sends power to the burner. What you end up with is a hot plate that can be on and hot but with no light on. This is a recipe for an accident. The Cadco CSR-3T appears to be from the same manufacturer, looks like it has the same construction, and the power on switch is lighted. Update June, 2013: I purchased two Cadco CSR-3T which is the twin to the Broil King and, even though the user manual indicated a lighted power on switch, it, too came with the painted switch. I contacted Cadco and described the problem. Customer service contacted Production, and told me there had been problems with reliability of the lighted switches, so they switched (so to speak) to the unlighted switch. But they had some spare lighted switches and would construct two for me at no charge and cover the return pickup and shipping of the two that I already had. Unbelievable! This product is manufactured in the US (Connecticut), and except for the power on switch, is a great product (it would be five+ stars in my book if it had a lighted switch). And the customer service is amazing. Hopefully, Cadco has fixed the problem.", "id": "3741261"}

{"review": "What I like about this product is that the power cord is a little more than 42 inches long. The manufacturer notes that an extension cord can be used and the type recommended. But due to concerns that a person could trip on a longer cord, or a child can pull it over on themselves it does discourage the use of extensions for this reason. It does go on to say if one chooses to use an extension cord, exactly how it must be placed to minimize danger. The The CSR-3TB has an 8 inch coil element. It cycles on and off to maintain the temperature selected. I found it heats up quickly and can also be used as a warmer after food is cooked. It is light weight and large. The feet of the product is not rubberized, so it does move around easily. I plan on putting rubber tips on the feet to deal with this. You need good counter space to use this item, as it is large.

It replaced a same size cook top but the dimensions needed were 1/16th of an inch more. A hand sander did the trick and the new stove top fit nicely. The stove top has performed as expected. The larger controls are nice and are easily removable for cleaning. The controls each have very clear temperature selection stops and a delineated simmer selection that is very handy.

{"review": "Cooking (mainly Italian) is my hobby. My 16 year old GE radiant still worked but the amount of time it took to heat up and, most importantly, the amount of time it took to cool down was frustrating. The heating time could be blamed on older burners but it is typical for radiant cooktops to take quite a while to cool down. When I had something that needed to be heated to boiling and then reduced to a simmer I had taken to turning on two burners -- one on medium or high and the other on low and moving the pan between them. I would have thought about a gas stove but my kitchen is not plumbed for gas. When I saw the induction concept I was somewhat sceptical at first and bought a single burner induction cooktop to try the concept. I quickly became a convert. The induction cooktop will bring water to a boil in less than half the time of my old radiant cooktop and, more importantly, the temperature can be reduced immediately. And when I say \"immediately\" I mean immediately. One can go from a rolling boil to no boiling within seconds (see video here - [...]). I had to have my electrical supply to the cooktop upgraded from 30 to 40 amps for the cost of about $800 and I can truly say that this cost and that of the cooktop has been well worth it. Since most of my cookware was not induction capable I did need to buy some more but that was a relatively minor cost. Besides, after 30 years of marriage my wife now has new things to give me for presents ;-) GE has a great product here. The large burner on the right will go to 3200 watts and will bring 4 - 6 quarts of water to a boil in 10 - 15 minutes. The cooktop looks great and functions even better. GE customer support was fantastic. The induction cooktop is supposed to fit right into a cutout for the Profile line but, prior to ordering, I emailed them to get the exact dimensions of the cutout necessary for my old cooktop. It took a few days but they did research it and emailed me the information. Both GE and Thermador have very useful information and videos on their web sites for anyone interested. Addendum: 1-22-13 I thought I would update this review after seeing reviews on some other items with comments asking for longer term evaluations. Gosh, has it been almost 5 years? Truly time flies. I still think that this cooktop is one of the best purchases I have ever made. It is still functioning perfectly (I hope that statement doesn't jinx me) and is still a joy to use. It looks as good as ever and I still smile when I use it. What more can I say?", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "Length:: 3:15 Mins All I can say is ....WOW!! I wish I had done this sooner. After exhausting but fun research, scouring the internet learning about induction, I finally pulled the trigger. I cannot tell you how pleased I am, ESPECIALLY with the clean up. My old gas cook top was black and was such a chore to clean up. My new induction top wipes off effortlessly because the top itself does not get hot, therefore spill overs do not bake on. The top does get hot eventually directly under the pan because it has a hot pan sitting on it. Now for something different than the other reviews. My home was wired with a 30 amp circuit to the cook top and research will say that you will need 40 amps. This particular top will only let you have two burners on \"Boost\" at the same time. To max out the rated amperage you must have all the burners on high at the same time. When you see how hot and fast that really is... I SERIOUSLY doubt you will ever need that. Induction is so efficient, that most of our cooking is done on #3 to #5. The scale is 1-10. The higher settings are for frying and boiling. I don't have the need to have 4 skillets frying or 4 pots of water boiling at the same time and I don't think I ever will. Anyway.... before considering calling the electrician, I decided to try it awhile first and see if we trip the breaker. If we do, and it becomes a problem, then we can deal with increasing the wire size and changing the breaker to a 40 amp. So far we have NEVER tripped any breakers and the top works absolutely flawless. DO NOT let the fact that you have a 30 amp service steer you away from considering an induction top. I suggest trying it first, THEN see if you need to increase your breaker size.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "In the heirarchy of cooktops, induction is king. Although induction is powered by electricity, it should not be confused with traditional electric cooking. Induction provides instantaneous results. The speed of heating a pan is amazing (surpasses gas and electric in speed and control), it does not throw heat (other than the hot pan), and the lack of heat generated beneath the surface means the cooktop is much cooler than either electric or gas, because there are no heating elements in the unit. Also, induction costs far less to operate than gas or electric. This unit has digital controls (with a lit display that only shows when it is on), and I know, for example, that olive oil will burn in the pan above 5, but 4.5 is perfect for sauteing. And it will remain perfect for sauteing throughout the entire cooking process, it will not get hotter or colder. Furthermore, you can store anything on the cooktop (we keep a bottle of olive oil on there, as well as a non-magnetic spoon rest. They stay cool to the touch regardless of how many units are on. Now there are downsides. 1. Cost: cost prohibitive for many, by far the most significant factor. There are no freestanding range/oven combos, which means that you need to spend money on individual range and oven to get a functional kitchen. Furthermore, unless you have a 40A cooktop in place, you will need to upgrade your electric. The total cost for us was around thirty two hundred for both the wall oven and the cooktop, with an additional cost of $150 for the electrician, and about $300 in replacing the pans. 2. Cookware: although most high end pans are made to be induction compatible, the majority of widely available cookware is not. Especially non-stick. I found a couple nice \"eco\" non-stick pans at a homegoods store, but be advised to take a magnet along with you shopping, and only buy pans to which it sticks. That being said, all-clad is typically induction compatible, and there is a wide movement to making pans that way. 3. Probably not a wise investment at this point if looking for a return on a home renovation for sale. While many people discover the benefits of induction for themselves, it hasn't taken off in the US yet, and most people won't know the difference until using it. I doubt people would recognize the benefits if we went to sell the house. Perhaps a brochure would be in order... Now for those that hate electric cooking, but don't have gas lines, this is an amazing solution--I think it is far better than the other methods of cooking. Also, if you frequently cook but have a smaller kitchen, this will keep it cooler. If you have gas lines, I'd have to say that the benefits of induction (compared to gas) do not outweigh the initial cost. This cost could be recouped by energy savings if you cook A LOT, or by weighing in other considerations, such as small children being burned. The 30\" is very useful, and is equivalent to a standard freestanding cooking range. The 36\" model would be appropriate if you are accustomed to having a 6 burner cooktop. I don't have any basis for comparison to other induction units, but I cannot find any faults with this unit. UPDATE: After cooking on this for over a year, I have a few additional comments: 1. Some induction compatible pans make noise when heating, not loud, but rather annoying. 2. The glass has scratched slightly in places. Still looks very sleek though. 3. Controls are annoying to clean. Despite the \"control lock\" button, when you clean the rest the water activates the buttons, making an error message and a beeping noise. 4. There should be a better way to seal off the edges next to the countertop. Has anyone tried silicon? 5. There are now \"all in one\" cooktop/oven slide in units available. UPDATE: Barkeepers friend works extremely well to clean the cooktop", "id": "3741261"}

I bought a set for a few hundred bucks the first time but my favorite is a $20 stainless steel pan from Kroger and a $18 Cast Iron skillet for searing steak. You do have to be careful with the cast iron cause it's heavy and this is a ceramic top. Though I haven't scratched it yet. As long as it's iron/steel with a very flat bottom with lots of contact for the induction field to work it'll work fine. I do have to get rid of my Calphalon aluminum cookware and that's a shame. (After I got rid of my black Circulon set, the first set that has ridges inside that's hard to clean, and bought a new set of stainless Cuisinart I realized the heating is a lot faster with the new Cuisinart cookware. Both have induction label on it and both cost about the same so not sure why the new set is quite a lot faster. May be because the Circulon are painted black and has concentric rings on the bottom and the Cuisinart has completely flat stainless bottom.) After 3 years of use (2012), I heard a pop and the whole thing died. I did pay $200 to extend the warranty to 6 yrs so no added cost for me but it is a concern as I've never had any stove break on me with the old gas and radiant cooktops. The repairman pretty much ordered the whole electronic assembly inside and that cost more then the cooktop at over $1600. Good thing I have the warranty. Not sure if I would buy GE again with the reliability issue. Watching the repairman replacing the magnetic heating elements shows the largest element has most of the magnets along the outer edge and quite empty, a few magnets, in the middle. That is why when using a small pan on the big element it actually heats slower than using the smaller elements. Overall I am sold on the induction cooktop. If you can afford the price the time saving alone on cooking and cleaning is worth it. 2 more years (2014) after the last complete gut replacement another board burnt out. Free warranty repair. I'm going to miss my warranty after it expire next year. But the problem is not just GE, my neighbor's Bosch started smoking last year, about 3 years old, and he had to replace a board too. I did notice with his cooktop the insulation on the element is much stronger and doesn't get damaged when you open the unit for repair. With the profile cooktop the insulation is some sort of ceramic fabric material that has the durability of icing on cake. Seriously you touch it and it's damaged. One of the reason why the repairman had to replace all the elements last time.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I don't understand why people haven't been really advertising one of the largest benefits of the induction stovetop - there is an AMAZING difference in the amount of heat produced in the kitchen!!! I live in Houston and my husband cooks a lot. He is very hot-natured. What a difference this induction stovetop makes! Electric and gas both cause so much extra heat in the kitchen that I have to believe that the induction stove will pay for itself by not heating up the kitchen. I cannot stress enough the difference we feel. My mother has a gas stove and her kitchen gets very uncomfortable in the summer when cooking. We used to have electric and it caused a lot of heat as well. We can cook for hours on the induction stovetop and it does not heat up the kitchen. In addition to that, we simply love the way it cooks. When you raise or lower the setting the change is instant. It makes it so much easier to control the cooking. We didn't have any problems adjust to the stove. We were pretty nervous about doing something so different, and we simply regret not having done it a lot sooner. Even though our Magnalite pots don't work on the stove, it was not a big deal to us. The inexpensive, ferrous pots that we bought at Kohl's to replace them work beautifully. Definitely no regrets. Everybody in the south should own one of these - especially if you cook a lot. Update one year later - We love this stove even more than when I wrote the initial review. Some important notes - ** If you're worried about scratching it, put a papertowel or thin dishtowel under your pot when you cook. We do this when we use our cast iron pots. I know it sounds weird - but remember it's the pot that heats up - not the stovetop. It truly works, and keeps your stovetop looking brand new. ** Works great if you work with melted chocolate. You don't need a double boiler because the lowest setting is mild enough to keep it melted. ** Cleanup is a breeze because nothing gets cooked onto the stovetop, since the stovetop isn't getting so hot. Update 05/03/2014 - Still no problems with this stove. Still looks great. So easy to clean as food does not cook on to it. Still using cheap stainless pots we bought at Kohl's and still loving them. We're so glad we weren't able to do a gas line, as that would have been miserable for the heat and cleaning compared to this.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "This cook top is every thing I had hoped it would be. I was replacing another 30\" cook top, so all I did was open the breaker, check to see if the circuit was dead, broke the old connection, popped-out the old cook top, dropped-in the GE, reconnected the wiring, closed the breaker, and that was it. One note, if you downloaded the instructions beforehand: a couple of times the instructions make bold note that if you have aluminum wiring, then you need Al to Cu connectors. Yep, but the COOK TOP has Al wiring, so if you have Cu wiring you need special wire nuts. A simple, online check with Lowes or Home Depot, or a call to a local appliance store, to check availability and get three wire nuts for an Al to Cu connection. For those with a science acumen, it's the galvanic action between the two, dissimilar metals that will cause corrosion--some will, incorrectly, say it's electrolysis, but that requires an electrolytic solution. A few reviews as to cookware seem moot. If one doesn't know what magnetic induction is, perhaps one should read-up on it before considering this item. I recently changed cookware to Le Creuset Tri-Ply because I needed new cookware and had induction cooking in mind, also. This is excellent cookware. Lesser cookware will work on this cook top as long as it's of a ferrous material--stainless steel or cast iron. However, the performance of this cook top using this cookware is outstanding--much better than my ancient experience with gas. Amazing! As for the 40 amp power requirement, when I popped the old cook top out, I noticed that the power rating was virtually the same as the GE one. This cook top ran for years on a 30 amp circuit. It should have been a 40 amp circuit, but the good ole boy electricians--I'm being generous--in rural East Texas used a 30 amp circuit and the old cook top never tripped the breaker. Induction cooking has to use less power than an electrical resistance cook top. Yes, induction and resistance are related, but using electrical resistance to heat has to be right up there with a wood-burning stove as to inefficiency. Short version. Get this cook top and some Al to Cu wire nuts. You'll have no buyer's remorse. BTW, instead of paying out the nose for an induction plate (hob) for use with your non-ferrous cookware, just get a cast iron griddle--preferably one without the built-up ring on the bottom. You're have to deal with the high specific heat, and resulting \"thermal battery\" of cast iron, but you won't need to use it that much. It's something that you'll probably want to have, anyway. One year later: Outstanding!", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I've tried electric, halogen, gas... with my new kitchen remodel I installed this on a recommendation from a friend. pricey but it's so amazing i'm never looking back. This review is for the 30\" but would apply to the 36\" as well. I believe 30\" is more reasonable for single cook usage. COOKING: I got the wolfgang puck collection from sams club. truly awesome. better than the costco kirkland version i feel. One large cooking surface and then 2 medium sizes and 1 small size. Note the actually surface for cooking is slightly smaller than the circle drawn. each circle can accomodate pans larger than it (I use a large square grill cast iron pan on the large circle and it still distributes heat well throughout). I use smaller pots on the medium circles without trouble. If it is too small though it will not work and start beeping like there is a malfunction. The circles are admittedly very hard to see without turning on the vent light. boiling water is almost 2/3 to 1/2 as fast as other stoves. a small pot boils within seconds. it truly is noticeable and i've never seen anything faster. it has made me a believer in induction efficiency. Range is from L,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,H. Here is the breakdown from what I have figured out thus far over 2 years of using this thing. The cooking is very even and predictable. It has made my cooking more precise than ever before. L -- awesome for keeping stuff warm, soups especially. it doesn't burn and you can leave stuff on L for 1-2 hours even with very little water evaporation. Don't over do it though as it will sooner or later remove all the water. 1-3 range -- very low simmer, excellent for slow stew. lower end if you can't babysit as much. 4-5 range -- good for slow cooking. spaghetti and noodles i boil the water fast at 9 or H and then drop to 5 for the rest of the cooking. it still has a few boiling bubbles rising to the surface frequently. I use 5 on a cast iron skillet to warm up soft tortillas. 6-7 range -- good for meats and most stirfry cooking. will boil water off very quickly. it doesn't burn meats too quickly at this range. cast iron is awesome for meats by the way. I cook my pancakes on cast iron at range 6 and it works extremely well even at high altitude Denver. 8 -- I use this to quick stir fry vegetables with my stainless steel pots. it will rapidly burn stuff so be quick on the draw. I often add a bit of water immediately after and let it steam in the pan. it will steam of water very quickly at this number. (Actually, to update I've now gone to using 8 to brown my raw chicken. 2 min each side is perfect for browning, then can slow cook for 4-6 more minutes with sauce or add water to steam cook a bit). 9/H -- only should be used for boiling water. it will burn everything else at this number. I prefer 9 for some reason as the water doesn't boil over the sides as much but whether 9 or H it will get out of control very quickly if you don't babysit it constantly. Also if you are warming up soups, 9 is good for fast warmups without burning the bottom layer. I found for some reason at H it will sometimes char the bottom of the soup (totally uncool). Note even though they tout the cook surface with induction, realize even though only the pan gets hot, it does transfer heat to the glass/ceramic surface thus the surface will be crazy hot after an extended usage. for practical purposes you still shouldn't touch it at all after use (I tried and burned my finger). It does cool much faster admittedly. Still should keep small children away and teach kids safety. That being said I love the flat and cool surface and commonly will put plates and other items on the unused sections so I can transfer food to plate easily. It makes the entire cooktop a cooking or working surface (except the controls). I even put hot pans from the oven on it to cool. CONTROLS: The touch controls are very easy to use. you need dry hands though and a dry surface. if you get any water on it at all it will start beeping and freaking out. and also all the stovetops will immediately turn off as well. perhaps a safety feature, but a bit annoying sometimes when you accidentally boil over some water and it shuts everything off until you wipe off the water and dry it. A quick bounty usually does the trick. Your hands must be dry as well. When you touch to turn on initially it will flash 5 and not start heating yet until you touch + or -. Then 5 will stop flashing and you can increase/decrease from there. As I use 6/7 most often this is very convenient. The controls are well placed in the middle and easy accessible. CLEANING: completely smooth one-piece glass surface is super easy to clean. no ridges no bumps. gas and electric coil was the worst. if you cook a lot and like to keep a clean look with low maintenance i strongly recommend these smooth surfaces. note though the edges are slightly raised so little crumbs can get under it. hasn't been a bit problem, but i'd prefer it to be completely flat with my countertop. perhaps my installation was not ideal... i can use the green scrub on the surface without scratching it. since it is glass it is stronger than standard steel knifes so you can cut on it without fear of scratching. I typically clean by using dishwasher soap on the green scrub and scrub off all the food particles, then dry it with a few pieces of bounty paper towel. After 2 years it still looks as good as new after this method. Takes me <1min to do it. MAINTENANCE: nothing so far and i've had it for almost 2 years now. been cooking pretty much every day on it too. i'm a heavy kitchen user. 30\" VS 36\"?: i've debated this issue a lot since i had the option when remodeling my kitchen. i have to be honest though i went with the 30\" because i cannot imagine needing so many pots/pans cooking at the same time. it is literally impossible for one chef to do so. I went with a 30\" cooktop and a 36\" hood because i read online that a wider venthood does a better job of capturing all the steam and exhaust from cooking. Also I figured it would give me the option to upgrade to 36\" cooktop if I really wanted it in the future. At present, 4 cooking surfaces is more than plenty and already pretty hard to manage all at once. I cook for my family of 4. SUMMARY: the fast, efficient, reliable cooking of induction and the super easy-to-clean surface have totally sold me. I'm never using another cooktop. You decide on 30\" vs 36\".", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "This review regards the ceramic surface only. Utterly disappointing. As a preface, I had a Bosch ceramic cooktop for 11 years. Not one scratch. I installed the GE and cooked my first meal using two brand new All-Clad stainless steel pots. The surface was cleaned and the pots were washed and checked for any burrs. The result after one use? Two scratches, one I can feel with my fingernail, on the two burners that were used. The GE is shipped with a sample of \"Cerama Bryte.\" The GE manual states Cerama Bryte can be used to remove scratches. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. The scratches were not removed. All Cerama Bryte did was remove the lustre from the ceramic top leaving a haze over both scratches. Now I have two scratches and two hazy spots on a cooktop used once. Bosch, 11 years no scratches. GE, 20 minutes-two hazy scratches. Would I recommend the GE? Only if you are not going to use it for cooking.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "The GE Profile Induction stovetop is everything I was looking for. Easily cleans with a paper towel and Windex, 100% controlled temperature, evenly cooks, heats up FAST!, in less then a minute completely boils water, looks beautiful with any decor and our pots and pans stay clean on the bottom because no flame is constantly hitting it. Under supervision, I use one piece of paper towel under the pot when cooking to catch any spill overs and to just keep the ceramic top clean. Even on the highest setting surprisingly the paper towel never burns. Amazingly The stovetop doesn't get hot only the pan does and directly under the pan. It's truly like MAGIC!. I don't have to worry about flames catching anything or anybody on fire. It's perfect for the kids to cook. I will never use gas again! What a MESS gas stoves make and how ugly they are with big burners. What a pain to clean a gas stovetop, I will never go back to gas. Here's what to be careful of... Never cook without something in the pot because it can overheat the pot and blow out the fuse on the cooktop, according to the directions this can also permentenly break the cooktop. We are being careful of that. I can see how that can happen if something boils dry or burns and overheats. Just like cooking a pan on a flame with nothing in it would really mess up the pan and become over heated. We are careful about not scratching the cooktop which really won't happen if you are gentle on how you put your pan on the ceramic. Just make sure there is noting under the pan that may scratch and it will be fine. We don't slide the pan on it, we just put it down gently and we also use a paper towel which we probably don't have to use but I feel better using it. No problems. The only thing I noticed that bugs me once in awhile when cleaning is the control lock does not stay locked, but that's no big deal. it's just a pain to clean over the lock and the on/off buttons. One thing to beware of is NEVER use tin foil directly under a pan when cooking, it will melt the tin foil and ruin the stovetop. Now a days for some reason foil melts when too hot. Yah I know, who would think but it's happing with all the new appliances and complaints are all over the internet. If heat is applied directly to tin foil it melts. It truly will ruin any appliance that this happens to. You can't get melted foil off without ruining the appliance. EDIT 6/26/2013 Still LOVE my Cooktop! No problems at all, no scratches, it still looks as good as new, and I figured out the problem with the lock button for cleaning the top without the touch pad turning on was because of me (user error).... I didn't know how to do it and thought there was something wrong with it, theres nothing wrong with it, the problem was that I was not holding down the lock button long enough to lock it. You need to hold it down for a good minute before it locks and to unlock it the same thing.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I have purchased many GE appliances over the years and been very satisfied. You expect \"6 sigma\" products and service from GE. This arrived in good shape and worked as expected out of the box. Cleaning is a breeze. I do prefer Gas to induction as it seems to heat the whole pot instead of just the bottom. So you need to learn to cook a little differently. Now the problem...less than 1 month of use and the \"3 light\" problem showed up. Only one burner was working. Since the problem showed up, I have seen other reviews on Amazon and on other sites with the same issue. You can't call for service except during M-F business hours. The tech came out and said we needed parts but they were on backorder. GE would not replace the unit despite not being able to tell when the parts would arrive. They did offer to pay for a rental stove. A rental stove? You must be kidding. Where would someone put such a thing? On the back porch? What about wiring? LOL Long story short, it was a $600 control board which was installed about a month later. Unit is now working normally. I would not recommend purchasing this unit as it may have a design issue or simply poor QC on their electronic boards. You can't make a judgement based on one incident but why take a chance? BTW GE offered me nothing for the inconvenience and suggested buying an extended warranty for over $300.", "id": "3741261"}

{"review": "Firstly, this is not the most inexpensive cooktop out there. In fact, we saw some prices from $800 to $1200, which caught my eye. But I had to remind myself of the most important point... \"We use our cooktop every single day!\" Much like our cars, but even more, we will be using this item for more years than we'll probably keep our cars. And because I'm the one who... \"Lives to Eat!, rather than Eat to Live\", I'll spend an extra $400 or $500 to get what I deem is \"the best value\" for our needs. I should note that one huge driving force for buying through Amazon was saving approximately $150 on the item, plus not having to pay another $120 in sales tax. And of course, with Prime... we got this item in \"Two-Days!\" (Yaa-Team!) Like many others, I looked online, and in the stores. One common thread regarding the GE Cafe line of gas cooktops...? ... Home Depot, Sears and other stores all carried this model in stock. I had no problem seeing, touching and comparing it to others \"on the floor.\" Forgetting price, it won out, even over the Kenmore Elite Series, which actually was about $400 less, but not as \"commercial looking.\" Up front, I'll share my greatest fear about buying this type of item online....... \"damage in shipping, requiring a return process which wastes time.\" The cooktop is delivered in the orginal GE corrugated box, with the stainless cooktop surrounded and distanced from all corners of the box. There are three straps holding the corrugated together. One of our straps was missing, but the box survived, and while a few small boxed parts may shift inside, fear not......... the cooktop is \"stationary\" in its' foam nest. Bottom line, other than a FedEx or UPS drive dropping the box harshly to where something pierces it and the range... I have a feeling most of these units arrive in their \"OEM, New condition.\" So, I've been cooking, literally, since I was a very young lad. And I have an electro-mechanical background, which helps as much as haunts my every decision when comparing prior to buying. I was as excited to upgrade our cooktop as my wife. And here's a few features that made this an easy choice for us, after looking at many other brands, features and appearance: BURNER LOCATION IN RELATIONSHIP TO GRIDS: Burners are distanced a bit more than you'll see in other gas cooktops. That allows for more a more efficient transfers of heat to your pans, and insures more even heating. BURNER SIZES and KNOB/VALVE CONTROL: There is a \"Fifth Burner, Center\", that has the highest BTU rating, and will heat a large \"Restaurant Pot\" of liquid quickly. The \"Rear Right\" burner is purposely small, and will allow cooking and melting delicates... butters, chocolates, etc. All burners have an incredibly \"low simmer setting.\" This means GE is using high quality valves-burner controls. Overall, you have control over your burners that you may have \"fought for\" with your old cooktop. OVERALL BUILD QUALITY: From the heavy cast iron grids to the heavy built control knobs, this Cafe Series is closer to commercial equipment; it's not a lightweight. INCLUDES BLUE LED HALO-LIGHTING WHEN A KNOB/VALVE IS \"ON\": An incredibly smart feature! I'm embarrassed to share how many times I've left a burner on when making our morning pour-over Brasilian demitasse coffee. It requires an incredibly low temp simmer to keep the coffee hot, without burning the coffee... (a huge no-no). Manys the time I've forgotten to turn that burner off when I transfer the coffee to a serving urn. The blue LED halo-lighting can easily be seen, especially at night, and is an instant reminder that you're \"gas is on!\" SAFETY LOCK-OUT: There's actually a safety lock-out knob that allows you to disable all of the gas knobs. We only have one grandchild under one-year right now, so I'm not sure we'll have to worry about this right now. But I'm sure I'll find another reason for assigning this feature \"5-stars!\" INCLUDES A CAST IRON GRIDDLE INSERT: We've been cooking with Lodge-brand cast iron skillets for quite awhile. So when I saw that the griddle adapter was made by Lodge, I was impressed. And what was interesting was the specialized burner control for use of the griddle. The \"Rear Left\" control includes a setting that will control both of the left side burners \"In-Tandem.\" It's specific to the use of the griddle, and gives you the even heating you'll need for golden flapjacks! Another item... like the distancing of the burners to the cooking grids, (extra distance for even heat), the griddle stands up a bit from the burners too, which adds to \"even heating.\" While no gas cooktop is perfect, I felt like we not only got a very fair deal buying via Amazon online, but we actually got the best product for our needs. It took me two hours to remove the old (18 years) GE Profile 36\" gastop with downdraft venting system.... AND ONLY 30 MINUTES to install this new Cafe Series. Of course, once you have a pre-cut hole in your counter, it's really just a matter of insuring a good fit, and customizing your sealing of the cooktop to the counter material. Outside of the \"quantitative evaluations\", we both feel that this cooktop... well, \"Just looks so good.\" It's probably the stainless finish with the bold grid design and the large knobs!", "id": "3741261"}

I didn't buy it as a kitchen trophy, although I do enjoy the many compliments it has gotten. I cook. A lot. I reheat, boil, fry, braise, sear, steam... I just canned peaches on this stove using the hot bath method on the BIG burner. I have also used the big burner for corn on the cob, crab legs and pasta. It is great for those times you have large amounts of water you don't want to wait eons for. Enough of the center burner. On to the griddle that comes with it. My family mocks me on how much I use the griddle. This weekend I made french toast on the griddle while I sauteed apples to top. It fit 4 large pieces of vienna bread perfectly. I have also made great fajitas on it - there is spatter clean-up, but it really sears so well. With the 3 other burners, I have yet to take the griddle off. The grates clean up well and the stainless wipes up beautifully. Do beware that when you wipe around the burners to make sure the tops are sitting securely. If you bump it off kilter, it won't light, but gas will flow. The grates are heavy and awkward, but that is the reality of what they are and part of the positives as well. After 6 months of pretty solid use in many different manners, I would have no issues recommending it.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "This is the first higher-end stove I have owned, and it is worth it. The design of the unit is just as attractive as the photo, which is what caught my eye when I first began looking for a range. Having four different BTU burners -- two normal, one small, one large and one huge, is quite convenient. I can also understand how expert cooks could maximize use of these features. The stove also cleans easily with a dishsoap-laden sponge. Cons: The wrong grill was included in the box, but when I called GE they sent the correct one immediately. The mounting brackets are pathetic if you have a hole that is larger than the specifications for this unit. Such an installation requires securing the range so it won't move around. I had to precisely place the range because if the hole had been an 1/8\" larger in any direction, it would have been visible from above. I purchased basic steel 1 1/4 X 5 \" tie plates, bent and drilled them, and then attached them to holes I carefully drilled in the thin bottom of the range. It worked perfectly.

(A horrible acrid, pungent odor). My 84 year old Mom had fallen asleep while boiling water for some instant coffee. I have since purchased 3 Induction Cooktops for elderly widows. There is no flame, The Cooktop by itself, does not provide any means to cause a fire. They have a timer for automatic shutoff, and most, like the Eurodib, have an overtemp sensor that shuts itself off. That means that when the water is all boiled away from the pan you are cooking Hard-Boiled eggs in, and the egg shells just start to brown from the heat of the pan, the Cooktop will turn itself off BEFORE the eggs explode all over the walls and ceiling. We've been cooking with Induction ever since. You can bring a cooktop outdoors to fry fish on the patio, the afternoon breeze does not blow the flame around like the gas burner on the side of the Barbecue. It doesn't heat up the Kitchen on a hot day. They are way more efficient than gas or electric which makes Induction the greenest form of cooking. They cook faster, and consume notably less electricity than Electric Stovetops I have owned several Cooktops from 1300 Watts to 240 Volt 3500 Watt Comercial Hobs. We currently have a 30\" 4 burner drop-in which brings a teapot of water to boil in less than two minutes. Inevitably, when someone buys an Induction Cooktop they have a drag-race with their Gas or Electric Stove. ALL Induction Models excel at this. The High setting is great for bringing water up to a furious boil that spits water out onto the cooking surface and beyond. They all also excel at getting a Carbon Steel Wok really hot for stir-fry. The real trick is... like the limbo man said: how low, can you go. A typical Induction Cooktop has ten temperature settings. After the water boils, typically I am cooking on 3-5, simmer on 2 or 1. Lately it seems that we are frequently cooking meals in our $60.00, 3.0 litre enameled cast-iron Le Creuset knock-off from Walmart. Cast iron works great. I've talked to some die-hard cooks who refuse to retire their $2,500 Super-Duper Cookware set for cheapo cast iron. Too bad, because it works as well or better than the expensive stuff. I just purchased this Eurodib Induction Cooktop for... you guessed it, another elderly lady living alone, who fell asleep and almost burned up her kitchen. I went to Marshalls and picked up an 8\" fry-pan, 1 qt sauce pan, 2 qt, and 3 qt for under $80.00 - Fantastic bargains on open stock good quality Inductionware. It is easy to find Induction Cookware sets for $119 - $199.00. I returned a previous purchase made last week at a local Asian food mart because it had poor temperature control, two speeds - High and off. For me, The Eurodib cooks high enough and low enough. The entire surface is a single flat black piece of ceramic glass, and the controls are capacitive touch-control through the glass. No buttons. If your pot boils over, it will just drip off the edge of the glass. My wife came up with the clever idea of taking 3 sheets of paper towels, folded back over to form a single 3-layer sheet. Place it between the pan and glass top. The magnetic waves cook right through it. Besides impressing your friends with the properties of Magnetic Wave Induction, it keeps the glass clean and smudge-free while automatically soaking up spills and splashes. The Eurodib is stylish and sleek, like a GE or Bosch 30-36\" Model. I thought the controls are just about as simple and intuitive as it gets. You really don't need a manual except if you like to read the pages of warnings like: Don't drop it, put it in the dishwasher, or plug it into 240 Volts. The Eurodib is 1600 Watts, VERY stylish looking in a Zen sort of way. I bought a simple set of Stainless Pots and Pans with a steel non-stick fry-pan to go with it because chances are good that our lady friend only has non-stick Aluminum Cookware. I tested all the $12.99 and $24.99 pots and pans. On 10, the water boiled very quickly and on 1 a few random, boiling bubbles. One thing very common to some (not all) Tri-Clad composite pan bottoms, is that they hum and vibrate on the highest settings. This has nothing to do with the Cooktop, but rather the manufacturing process used to bond the metal layers. Induction uses high frequency waves to excite the metal molecules, causing layers to vibrate. Setting the power levels to 6 or below stops the hum. At setting 6, you wouldn't want your soup to boil any faster. As I said, except for deep-frying, Wok cooking or heating Indian flat bread on cast iron, you probably won't cook any higher than 5 or 6. That has been my experience on every Cooktop I've owned. There is one Cooktop on Amazon that I know of, that has twenty settings, and that makes for more low heat choices. I have not found that to be necessary. Might be good for Fondue or Fudge? Our 30\" Bosch has 19 settings, I think, much more precise than any other cooking medium. 1600 Watts is 12.5 Amps max, which lets you plug in to any 20 Amp Wall Socket that doesn't share with the toaster or Microwave on High. Our first Cooktop was 1300 Watts, and we were very satisfied with the way it cooked. Having owned enough Induction Cooktops, I can comment on Fan noise. They all use un-quiet high powered 5-bladed fans to cool the large Heat Sinks. If there is a quiet fan out there on a Cooktop, I haven't found it yet. The noise level ranges from \"I can get used to that\" to wow, it's going to take a while to get used to that\". It has never been a big factor for me. The advantages far overshadow any fan noise, it certainly is not a deal-breaker. It won't take long to acclimate to the Eurodib. It belongs to the not so loud group. I like the Eurodib a lot. I think the all glass top, the absence of any surface plastic, along with the very Intuitive Controls make it worth the extra price compared to lower-priced models. It just works! I would rate it 4.5 stars if it were possible, not because it falls short in any way, but rather I would have to get pretty excited for 5 stars, and Induction Cooking for me is the only way I cook for the past 8 years. That's not exciting, just normal. The lady we gave it to is very excited about not having to get excited about boiling water for tea. She can set the timer and forget about it. If she falls asleep, a little scorched Mac and Cheese and it turns itself off. Peace of mind - what's it worth? Walter O.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "- I got this model form a local store. It cost $100. - This unit looks beautiful and reliable. It's not like other cheap models. - It works like magic. The first excellent thing is it cooks everything VERY FAST, much faster than electrical range. I have done stir-fry, meat cooking, and water boiling with it. This is a feature of induction cooktops. However, expensive models usually cook faster than cheap ones because they consume more watts. - The second excellent thing is it just HEATS the POT. The air and the cook-top area around the pot are COOL not hot. For the first time in my life, I'm not spending my energy money to heat my kitchen while cooking. Also, this is much safer for the cook by preventing accidental burning. After using it for 80 minutes, the whole unit is still cool to my touch except the area below the pot. Amazing! This is a feature of induction cooktops. - The third excellent thing is it does NOT create any SOOT on the pot's bottom. That means I don't have to spend time scraping soot off the bottoms of my pots. Consequently, I spend less time cleaning the cookware and the cooktop. It's a blessing that I have been praying for. This is a feature of induction burners. - The fourth excellent thing is the TIMER. Using this feature, I just SET IT and FORGET IT. And the food is never burnt. For example, to steam vegetables, I put more than enough water in the steamer. Then I set the time at 20 minutes, the temparatue at 240F. Then I go away and do something else. One or two hours later, I come back and the cooktop has been turned off automatically. The vegetables were cooked and warm. Perfect. This is what multi-tasking means. - It can accommodate large pots that have bottoms with diameters up to 10 inch or 25.5 cm. Cheaper models can't do this. I found the maximum diameter of pots or pans that this unit works best is 8 inch. When I use a frying pan of 10\", the food on the outer edge is cooked much slower than the one inside. Obviously, the \"heating element\" of this unit covers up to only 8\" of the cooking surface. - The high-quality ceramic top looks more durable and attractive than that of cheaper models. It's easy to clean too. - It's portable. You can use it any where that has an 110v-120v electrical outlet. - There are 3 ways to control it: temperature, power level and timer. The temperature control can increase/decrease by 30 degree F increment. It can go up to 450 degree F. For simmering, I have to use power level setting. Usually, i set it at level 2. The temperature setting can be set from 180F to 450F with 30 degree interval only. For example, I can set it at 180F, 210 F etc. I can't set it at 200 degree F. The timer can be set to maximum 150 minutes only. After that, the unit automatically turns itself off. - It has a safety feature that automatically shuts it off after the pot is taken away for more than 4 seconds NOT 9 seconds as it claims. This causes a small inconvenience when I'm cooking multiple dishes with multiple pots. I mean when I take more than 4 seconds to switch the pot, the burner will automatically turn itself off. When this happens, it takes me only one second to press the soft power button to power it on again. The strength of this burner outweighs this minor weakness. - It's cooling fan makes humming sound that is much lower than that of my kitchen hood fan. So, it's not a problem for me. - Thanks to this unit, I now use my electrical range for baking only. I highly recommend it to anybody who does his or her own cooking. - RELIABILITY Updated Mar. 2014 I have been using it for more than 18 months, it still works like a charm. P.S. 1. Where to BUY MAGNETIC Stainless-Steel COOKWARE To use any induction cooktop, you need magnetic stainless steel pots and pans. That means if you put a magnet onto them, it will stick. All manufacturers state on the box of their cookware that it supports induction cooking or not. I found Ikea sells these cookware at the most competitive price. Moreover, they are sold separately too. That means you can buy only what you need. You don't have to buy a set of 6 pots and pans when you need only 3. 2. HOW is INDUCTION COOKING COMPARED to GAS? Based on the video demonstration by professional cooks in a French restaurant in Paris, induction cooking is faster than gas. There's no difference in the look and taste of the cooked food. You can find this 9-minute video clip on Youtube by searching for INDUCTION VERSUS GAS. It's in French with English subtitle. In shows 2 cooks cooking the same 2 dishes. One person cooked them with an induction wok. The other with a gas wok. In the end, when the induction cook finished the second dish, the gas cook had just started the second one.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "Eurodib P3D: (This review includes notes about use with an off-grid Trace SW-4024 sinewave inverter, as well as with utility power. Items in square brackets [] apply to the inverter power.) Measurements are from a Kill-A-Watt P4400 meter [and other tools]. Look for my comparable review of the Sunpentown SR-964TB... There is a spark on connection to AC power, and an instant draw of 41 VA, but only 1 W of real power. This reactive current continues even with the cooker completely off. Since residential users are only billed for \"real power\", there is no disadvantage when using utility power. [On my Trace inverter, the apparent power varies between 40 and 113 VA, staying constant within 2 VA for minutes and then making a step change. Perhaps due to the changing waveform of the Trace inverter? The real power consumed at the input to my inverter is much lower, but if your inverter does not include a hundred-pound iron transformer to reflect the reactive spikes, you may see the full consumption, even when the cooker is \"off\"! Since this keeps the inverter constantly awake, a switched power outlet is advised!] The unit turns on in \"Heat\" power mode at setting 5 which is 850 W. The available power levels are: Setting Power [Inverter] 10 1550 [1550] 9 1370 [1350] 8 1250 [1250] 7 1080 [1050] 6 980 [975] 5 900 [850] 4 820 [780] 3 700 [680] 2 680 [680], 50% duty 1 650 [680], ~30% duty The power factor always reads 0.99, with \"VA\" identical to Watts! Readings are much more stable than the Sunpentown cooker. \"Temp\" settings 210 and below always use power 6, 980 W [975 W]. Temp 240 and above use power 10, 1550 W. Once the setpoint is reached, power cycles between the 4 to 6 W drawn by the cooling fan and the appropriate power setting as needed. I have not used the higher temperature settings, I don't do much cooking in oils. The following experience is with a 20 cm enameled cast iron saucepan: Temp setting 210 keeps water at a constant rolling boil and uses constant power; rice and other grains will spatter and eventually boil over. Temp setting 180 produces no visible boiling of plain water or rice at all, but will nicely cook home-rolled grains. Depending on the viscosity of your breakfast, it may overshoot just a bit and make a few spatters, but will then settle back to calm cooking. Temp setting 150 is probably only useful for \"keep warm\" use. The temp mode seems less friendly than Sunpentown's. The low power settings are in fact useful for slow simmering, '2' being ideal for cooking rice. My experience with the temperature sensors may depend upon my particular pans. I tend to use the same pans for the same tasks every time, and have not verified that the same setting produces the same result in a different pan. But the same pan on my two different cookers produces quite different results. A 20 cm cast iron pan with a cup of brown rice takes between 0.31 and 0.42 KWh, at power level 10 until boiling, then power level 2 for continuous barely bubbling. Same pan with rolled grains and soft seeds plus a similar amount of water takes 0.10 KWh, over a much shorter time at temp setting 180, with little actual boiling. The Eurodib uses capacitive touch controls, with no tactile buttons to guide your fingers to proper location or provide feedback, but there are beeps when you activate one. They generally require the same kind of distinct \"tap\" as modern smartphones, but it is possible to activate them when wiping the surface of the cooker. When you lift the pan off of the cooker, it begins beeping, and you have about ten seconds to replace the pan or place another one, otherwise it turns itself off. (Note to other reviewer - it only beeps four times during the wait period, but they are longer than one second each.) After a couple months of use, the cooker still gives off a whiff of \"new electronics\" smell when you turn it on - but I'm way out in the fresh air of a redwood forest, it might not be noticeable in normal locations. With its power-factor correction and ability to provide full output on inverter power, the Eurodib seems better suited to off-grid use than my Sunpentown SR-964TB. The temperature settings on the Sunpentown seem more useful, but the low power settings on the Eurodib handle all the tasks the temperature settings can't. The cooling fans are about equally noisy, but Eurodib's goes off immediately while Sunpentown's runs for minutes after you press \"off\". They should be variable speed, like modern computer fans! For most of my cooking, induction is my first choice. Even 1000 W of induction is dramatically faster than the expensive full-size electric quartz radiant range, and quite comparable to my ancient Wedgewood commercial gas range on propane. The best part is setting a temperature and walking away, knowing you won't find a mess when you return.", "id": "3741261"}

{"review": "I thought I should review it. I would have bought from Amazon but had a special option to get this free--and free is better than any discount! The induction plate has only been tested once but it works as promised. The fan is a little distracting at first but less noisy than a microwave. It heated so quick I wasn't ready and my shrimp cooked dry but even cooking that fast (it was a very small cast-iron skillet with 100 gm. of shrimp) it wasn't cooked to death or burned like it might have been on the standard glass-top electric stove but very similar to shrimp cooked on a hibachi type grill. Next time I will be smarter and have it all seasoned before setting the pan on the plate. I was clogging the spice bottles with all the steam from it cooking so quickly. I bought this plate mainly for canning season. My stovetop has only 1 large burner and I found canning difficult with the two large pots not having large size burners. Either the canning water wasn't boiling or the jam was not cooking evenly because it was on a small burner. Frustrating. I started looking on Amazon for ideas and came across the induction cooking plates and saw the light. I got some great information from all the reviews and I have to say the question section of the items for sale is really great. I was surprised how many responses I got to my questions. Really shows that Amazon is a great place to shop and we all contribute to make it better for shoppers (like me!). I can't say enough about this plate and I've only had it out and used it once but it seems well made, without plastic sides to worry about larger pots melting those sides, etc. The operation is easy enough to do without much reading but I do have to laugh at the instruction book. Obviously the English is a poor translation (like In addiction instead of In addition) but very clear and informative so no fault there. Just amusing. Depending on the size of pot you want to use, I highly recommend this one for a larger pot option. And it seems to love cast-iron so a good cooking choice. Just got a new lightweight cast iron wok about the same time and I can't wait to use this for woking. The fast and high heat without overheating would make wok cooking great. Unlike other stovetop options that never really get the pan as searing as you'd like and yet on this plate it cooks fast and cools down quickly.", "id": "3741261"}
{"review": "I read many reviews and searched through multiple sites for a single burner induction cooktop to fill in for a defunct burner on my kitchen stove. I hope to upgrade to full induction and this unit is a good introduction to the induction method of cooking/heating. I had to purchase Analon Nouvelle Copper no-stick skillets from Macy's that are induction suitable (had a gift card, but same price on Amazon) because by cookware was incompatible. I already owned a cast iron Lodge Dutch oven that works with induction; I made a pot of chili last week and followed the advice of placing a piece of parchment paper between the pot and the cooking surface to prevent scratching, and that worked fine. I have been using the Eurodib unit for about a month now. It heats the pans hotter than I would have expected. I would recommend standing by while cooking the first few times because it is easy to overcook items. We have been cooking mostly on the lower temperature ranges (180 to 210). The surface does get hot from the pan/pot but cools fairly quickly, sooner than a standard electric burner. The unit shuts off within one second if a pan is removed or is unsuitable for induction. The fan is not terribly noisy, my microwave is worse. I do pick up an occasional whine that some reviewers complained about, but it isn't as annoying as I feared.

{"review": "I'd repaired our old JennAire downdraft range top over 15 times in the 14 years we've been living here. What finally made me throw it out was the 'sockets' for the heating elements were really worn out. (I can always buy new calrod heating elements, but they plug into built-in sockets - which were so worn that they wouldn't make contact any more). Replacing the sockets would have been 2 days of frustration and about $120 in parts. So.... My wife and I decided to \"risk\" getting this ceramic cooktop. We'd heard lots of horror stories about the difficulty of keeping it clean and new-looking, but our selection of down-draft units in the same 30\" size was very limited. I'm quite the DIY guy, cutting and fitting the fan box on the unit, and re-cutting the 6\" air ducting under the counter to fit. Not for the faint of heart, but this is a replacement unit, not new construction - and such things are to be expected. I installed it 3 months ago. My wife uses it several times a day - and is very happy with its performance. It turns out that it's much easier to keep clean than our old JennAire! A real surprise! Still looks like new and I expect it will continue to look brand new for at least the first 3 years. Haven't spent a penny on special cleaners or pads yet - just using the 2oz bottle that came with the unit, twice a week, and have only used about 1/4 ounce total so far. I'd shopped around for pricing, including the big box stores - and buying it from this seller was the best deal by at least $250.", "id": "3741261"}

{"review": "We purchased this stove for a kitchenette we were putting in our home office. It's a very nice little stove with electric ignition. It functions well, it was easy to install and burns very cleanly. We've had it for 3 months and used it lightly, and everything is great. Stylistically, it's nice to look at as well. Overall I would recommend this product for someone who needs a light use two burner gas stove. Here are the (minor) things that keep me from giving it a 5 star rating: 1) The on/off gas knobs are a little too close to the main burner. It would have been better if the main (larger) burner was in the rear. The actual layout won't burn the hair on your fingers or anything, but it just feels a little tight/warm compared to a full-size stove. 2) The electric ignition is \"manual\" - you turn on the gas and hold down the knob in order to light the gas. When the gas is lit, you release the knob. I would have preferred for the more normal system where you turn the knob all the way to maximum and the electric ignition goes on and then you back the knob off to turn the electric ignition off. 3) The electric ignition must stay on for a few seconds otherwise the gas flame goes right out. This period is noticeably longer than other electric ignition gas stoves I've used. These three complaints are very minor, and maybe other people wouldn't even notice (or perhaps prefer the way at least #2 and #3 behave now versus the alternatives).", "id": "3741261"}

I dropped this in the top of a wooden sideways, so that when looking at the counter, the burners are left and right, not front and back. All in all, it burns very nicely and looks great. It has a thermocouple, so you do have to hold down the knobs a little longer than expected... the flame must heat the sensor a little bit to stay lit, but once you understand and get past this, you just hold down the knob a little longer. As mentioned in another review, the 2 knobs are a little close to the bigger burner, but I haven't had any problems with this yet.

{"review": "I have a 68\" kitchen located in my entry hall (not uncommon in Manhattan) and I needed to find an attractive cook-top which didn't take up a lot of counter space as every inch matters. It looks much more high-end than it is. This cook-top has worked out quite well. I am happy with the ease of installation, and the overall look. The burners are nice and powerful, the back one is great for getting a sizable pot boiling quickly. As is to be expected with any black glass topped stove, every drop of grease shows, but it is easy to wipe up, and the cast iron grate is substantial (yet not too heavy). My only complaint would be that it is difficult to adjust the flame size. You need a very very tiny long shafted screwdriver to insert into a tiny hole in the valve stem. I do not have one of these tiny screwdrivers, and after searching half a dozen hardware stores, I have given up the search and learned to live with it.", "id": "3741261"}

{"review": "This dishwasher is absolutely wonderful. Was easy to set up (except be sure to push the washer arm down into place - mine had come out in shipping despite being very well packaged, no biggie). I can't believe how many dishes fit and get washed so thoroughly in this little thing! It does a perfect job of washing dishes. The hose goes on & off the faucet with ease in 2 seconds using their supplied adaptor. Seems very sturdy and well made. My only complaint was that the instructions tell you to be sure to use dishwasher detergent \"with chemicals\". This is ridiculous - you can now purchase natural dishwasher detergent at most health food stores, and the one I am using works like a charm (Seventh Generation Automatic Dishwashing Detergent). My kitchen is tiny but this guy fits perfectly between counter and cupboard. I can't believe I waited so long to get a dishwasher, what a time saver!!!

{"review": "My dislike of doing dishes turned most of the counter space of my small Manhattan kitchen into physics-defying stacks of procrastination. This countertop dishwasher takes up about 60% of usable counter space in my apartment, a sacrifice I'm willing to make but for city dwellers, definitely measure it out. This unit is perfect for one to two people. My loaner husband no longer lives next door to me so I was apprehensive about installing the faucet adaptor myself, turns out it was a cinch. I found a helpful video online which showed the tool I needed to get: [...] Normally I don't read manuals, this one I read cover to cover. Some of the typos and wording are good for a laugh and its focus is on how to load a hypothetically uniform set of dishes no one actually owns. Fortunately, the Amazon community helped me fill in the blanks, I'm very grateful for their assistance. Here's what I learned from them and from using the machine: 1. Turn on your hot water all the way when you've got it set up and are ready to run it. The cold water will tax the motor. 2. If you're using Cascade Complete gel packs, those go in the detergent compartment on the door. There's a little basket on the left side that's for dishwashing tablets. The reason I like the Cascade Complete Gel Packs is it's got everything in it, including the rinse agent that keeps your glasses from streaking. 3. You don't have to stress out if you don't turn the faucet off immediately after the cycle is done. Water won't continue to run. I mean, I wouldn't go on vacation without turning off the faucet but you don't have to obsess that there's going to be some water pressure build-up that's going to shoot your shiny new countertop dishwasher into space if you're absorbed in another activity. 4. It doesn't dry plastic, but does dry my plates and pots. A few times I rinsed a couple of dishes again, they were super shiny so I was suspicious maybe the Cascade Gel Pack left some residue, so basically I ran them under water again because they looked too clean, starting to worry that I have trust issues. 5. The packaging is so sturdy, Wile E. Coyote could have dropped an anvil on it and it would have been fine. I've received mutilated deliveries from other companies with everything from footprints on top of the box to holes where the fork lift went through it. This can withstand whatever fury the delivery company dishes out. 6. The adaptor on your faucet takes getting used to. It produces a very strong stream of water so you only need to turn your faucet on a little to use it. I've already had a few accidental wet t-shirt contests but the good news is I won. 7. It's very quiet. Sometimes too quiet, I get paranoid it's not running but it is, it's just using its indoor voice. There's about a minute total where there's audible noise. 8. The hoses that connect from the unit to the faucet are annoyingly stiff. It's good to know that it's not going to spring a leak any time in the near future but I have to figure out some hook system to make them less obtrusive. 9. There's a plastic warning in the manual and one of my Tupperware lids didn't make it. It was probably eighteen years old so it lived a good life. I've washed plenty of other plastic items that made it out just fine. 10. Don't forget to turn the power on the dishwasher off before you unload it. If you don't, it makes this annoying beeping sound that the manual describes as \"mooing\". I assure you, there are no barnyard sounds with this machine. I'm very happy with my purchase. I would give it 4 and 3/4 stars because of the hose, amount of counter space it takes up and its not drying everything 100% completely. It's not perfect, but it's very close and what more could a girl ask for.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "THIS UNIT COULD NOT IMPROVE, IT IS SO PERFECT. HAVE HAD CLOSE TO 9 OR 10 OTHER DISHWASHERS, ALL INSTALLED OR FULL STANDING PORTABLES, MANY TOP BRANDS.

I use the Cascade complete small pouches and just put in one and walk away knowing that I will not have any dried-on food after the dishwasher finishes its cycle. It has a wide selection of cycles to use for different purposes, have used most, all work fine. As I said, I am seventy years, completely set it up myself with no problems other than toggling it back and forth on stools to lift up to counter by myself. Once up there, could not be easier to set up. Would highly recommended to anyone needing a small dishwasher, would be difficult to utilize in a family situation. Would probably need to run 2/3 times per day if more than 3/4 in family. What really surprises me is how quiet the unit is when running. do hear the water exiting the hoses but you have that with any. Forgot to add, the packing of this unit is unbelievable. Would have taken a Mac Truck to damage it. To those that claim they have difficulty loading this, I recommend reading the manual front to back, unlike a lot of manuals, this one is helpful. As with most new things, there is a learning curve. But the time put into learning, pays off with great rewards. AUGUST 11, 2012.

{"review": "I have been browsing portable dishwashers for quite some time and debating whether or not it would be worth the investment. Thankfully I trusted the reviews here and gave this countertop dishwasher a try. It was definitely worth every penny. The heavy duty wash takes quite a while, but my dishes come out sparkling. I wanted to put the dishwasher to the test so I put a small beat-up pot of mine in it. The dishwasher did such a good job with my pot that it took off most of the scorching on the bottom. I had a full size dishwasher awhile back that couldn't do that. I'm taking off one star because the heavy duty wash setting has quite a few cycles, and it seems to sit for a long time between those cycles.

{"review": "In a small apartment kitchen it seems the counters are forever full of dirty dishes. Give up about two feet of linear counter-top with this dishwasher and you can replace dirty dishes with a big white boxy appliance. We are averaging, in a family of 2, about one and a half cycles a day. There are several problems with the d/w design. - it really does NOT handle dinner plates that are larger than 10 inches without slanting them into the racks, and this cuts down a lot on the space available for dishes. While the shorter height allows the d/w to sit under the upper cabinets, this compromise means that normal dinner plates (and forget about modern large plates or serving pieces) just are not a good match for this sized d/w. - the strange permutations of the racks has very shallow tines for plates (if your plates have a deep \"bowl\" they won't stack neatly), low clearances for glasses and some widely spaced racking that lets a lot of normal dishes slip between support racks. If you stack the dinner plates where they suggest, there's less room for bowls, glasses and mugs. If you put your glasses and mugs towards the front to accomodate the dinner plates, they slip between the support racks. Unless you use cups and saucers, the folding upper rack meant for your coffee mugs is too short. Stacking chaos is the order of the day until you realize you just won't fit in a 6 piece setting unless everything is miniaturized. - the cutlery box has a lid on it with holes for supporting cutlery. But the lid is either on, or off, not one half up and the other down. Since half of it has holes obviously meant for chopsticks and not north american cutlery, the lid has to come off and your cutlery leans into each other. This sort of design drives you nuts and means, ultimately, that you will probably run it a few times a day if you want all your dishes washed in the machine. The run-time is 80 minutes for a cycle. On the up side, being a small dishwasher that won't hold 6 sets of dishes unless you are a Liliputian, it's a quick unload and load up, and keeps your dishes off your counter. It is not too loud, the set-up is easy and fast, the connections done with a small wrench to tighten the faucet adapter, and the dishes, if stacked correctly, come out clean. Make sure to use rinse-aid and the recommended amount of d/w detergent or soap (I use a green product and with the recommended measurement have no problem with dishes being clean). Bottom line; it's maybe better than washing dishes, but it does not provide all the convenience of a full size dishwasher in a smaller size. It provides about 35% of the convenience of a full size dishwasher, and my 3 stars reflects this limitation.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "You cant beat it for the price. Period. I have had dishwashers all over the place - I've used Bosch, Whirlpool, no-names, whatever - used it, been there, done that. It is extremely difficult to find a dishwasher sub $300 that does a good job. Its just the truth. The cheap, lower end built-ins usually are sub-par and break down after about a year. - Stainless steel interior. One reason why I chose this was because you cannot argue with stainless steel, which will never absorb anything quite like plastic. - Price point below $300 - you cannot do better with this price. - Small kitchen footprint and small electrical cost and even smaller water usage - barely uses or needs any water because it is a smaller unit. For 1-2 people, this dishwasher is perfect. - you can load an amazing amount of dishes in. such a small dishwasher. I also mixed up the locations of the dishes and was still pleased with.how they turned out. You can also hook this unit up permanently which I did - the intake hose opening is standard dishwasher and luckily I had 3/8 OD on my pipes so just a 3/8OD T and 5 ft tube (I replaced with metal for hot water) and then put the out under my sink after cutting some PVC - about $35 all said and done, and I don't have to hook or unhook it anymore. So I tested the unit - unscrubbed dishes, no prewashing: dishes coated in alfredo sauce, dishes coated in chili oil - and on the 'many dishes' (heavy?) setting they got them all perfectly clean. Slight problems that others have noted: the drying cycle takes forever. I just open it up, and they dry spotless. No problems here. The dishwashing cycle takes about 2 hours. Whatever, at least I'm not washing them? Will update the review if there is interest in a few months.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I have had this dishwasher only a week. I am using in it from Walmart - The Great Value Dishwasher Powder and The Great Value Rinse Agent. This dishwasher appears to be very well made but, as I said I have only had it a week and time will tell how durable it really is. As for cleaning a large load of dishes this dishwasher does an outstanding job! Does it hold up to six place settings? Everybody's dishes are different and it holds about four and then some for me. For those of you who are wondering if this washer drains the water by gravity or it is pumped out I believe it is pumped out but, I could not find any documentation on this. Very easy to hookup to you kitchen faucet. Does a great job drying the dishes. Update 10/26/2011: Dishwasher performs perfectly! Here are some additional thoughts - It says it in the directions that come with the dishwasher but make sure you add your dishwasher powder just before you start the wash not 2 hours earlier or it will harden.

{"review": "I'm a single, 23 yr old bachelor living in an apartment that is otherwise perfect save for its lack of dishwasher. I don't know if I'm just bad at washing dishes, but I seem to have a habit of letting them pile up and then taking 2+ hours to wash all of them - only to go back later to get \"clean\" dishes and take them out of my cupboards dirty. So I finally got sick of it and decided to purchase a countertop dishwasher. I immediately came to this model, as it is the highest/most rated set on Amazon, and was put off immediately by the wealth of reports of holes being machined into the bottom of the set clear through to the washing compartment, some reviews stating large plates wouldn't fit, etc. I spent a lot of time deliberating on it but finally decided \"Screw it, I'm going for it.\" First, I'd like to say I love Amazon (Or UPS, I suppose?) for consistently finding my apartment and dropping off whatever I purchase directly at my doorstep. I live behind a traditional home a ways back from the street, and there's a rather narrow set of stairs leading up to my place, but I've never once had anything purchased delivered anywhere than up my stairs directly at my doorstep. I was rather surprised with this set because it comes in a box in another, larger box, and it was rather heavy and unwieldy. But they did it! I unpacked it, immediately examined the underside for those machined holes - and there were none! I am assuming that a small shipment that went out had problems, because the more recent reviews seem to not have this issue. My plates were a touch big - which I expected, the review that stated 10\" for plates, I think it was, was correct. My plates are quite a bit over at nearly 11\", so I can only put two, maybe three of my large plates in at an angle. Granted you're not supposed to do this, considering the spray arm is on the bottom and sprays directly upward, but I've not had a problem with it cleaning properly. Additionally one review I read said something about the device \"clearly being designed for chopsticks\" - I couldn't disagree more. I have no idea why the reviewer said that because all of my utensils fit fine, once you take the cover off the utensil caddy. Cleaning quality is fantastic. I put in two loads of well soiled, unrinsed dishes, and they came out surprisingly clean. Now, hygiene and maturity aside, I have been letting these dishes pile up for the last two weeks through a combination of not wanting to clean them and waiting for my dishwasher to arrive, so they were in a really gross state, with lots of caked on dried gunk. There was a little bit of residue on a couple of glasses, and the underside of a dish or two, after doing a pots and pans load, but considering the state of the dishes when I put them in (and considering that normal people will rinse dishes beforehand, and not let them cake up and dried for two weeks before washing them), I couldn't imagine anyone having trouble with this set cleaning their dishes. Finally, the adapter set worked perfectly. The set up was simple - just screw on a couple of tubes by hand to the back of the set, unscrew the head of the faucet, and screw the adapter on, turn your water on hot, and done! If you're someone who doesn't read the manuals, the tubing becomes pressurized during a run, so if you go to remove the adapter, turn the water off, press the red button to depressurize it BEFORE removing it, otherwise you'll get a spray of hot water everywhere. All in all a FANTASTIC purchase. I've never been so excited for something so... domestic. But I'm looking forward to never having to handwash another damn dish again. 5/5 on all counts. I also want to add that the set is very quiet. I was able to sleep with it just a hallway away, couldn't hear it at all. EDIT2: I'm here responding to comments on my review and thought it'd be nice to check in. It's been 6 months and this set is still doing a great job of cleaning, even with heavily soiled glasswares. I've put some dirty casserole dishes and they've come out pretty good - I'd still recommend thorough rinsing beforehand, though, just as good practice. The use of Jet Dry or some other liquid rinse boost really makes a difference in these smaller sets too. Thing is holding up great tucked under a cabinet and I only connect it when I need to do a set of dishes. Following other user advice to keep it open when not in use to let it dry out is, indeed, keeping it from smelling funny. It smells just like it did out of the box, because I've made sure to let it dry out and not collect food particles. It's also worth mentioning there is a trap in the basin that you can unscrew and pull out and rinse in the sink. It catches things like paper labels that slip off or big chunks of food that weren't powered away with the cleaning cycles. Still one of the best purchases I've made.", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "I just bought this dishwasher and was thrilled at how quickly it arrived. I purchased it on Wednesday and it arrived on Thursday! Tracking was a breeze. Once I unpacked the unit, I was surprised at how light it was. It came with all the parts to install it to my sink's faucet, though it did take me a few minutes to discover the plastic hookup actually had the faucet adaptor inside it. Once I pulled the metal faucet adapter out and screwed it onto my sink's faucet - I was ready to go. I hooked up all the tubes - be careful not to over tighten them, but get them tight! I plugged the unit in and turned on the water. No leaks so I put a few dishes in and started the washer last night. The unit is surprisingly quiet (for a dishwasher) and it takes awhile for the load to run. Once the load was finished I just open the door to let everything dry out. Tonight will be my second try with the dishwasher. So far everything is good, no leaks. I set the unit up on a kitchen cart with wheels so I can just move it to the sink when I'm ready to use it. The silver color is nice and the door design is very simple. No buttons to press before you can open the door or close it. Just a simple pull or push to shut it. When the unit is powered, opening or closing the door results in a beep. This is an energy star efficient washer, so I'm hoping it saves me on time and water (hand washing dishes tends to take me more water than this unit uses).

{"review": "Update - April 2012 and it still is working great. Once you figure out how to load it and what works it becomes really easy, I wouldn't trade it ! I think if you have had a problem with the dishes getting clean you first want to check your water hardness and rinse agent. Also you need to make sure you run your water and it is HOT before you attach the hoses to start the dishes. If you don't have the hoses attached tight enough or properly, it's going to leak. Every time I plug it in, I always give the hoses a glance just in case, since I am moving it back and forth. Also I have to drain the hoses into a bowl after each wash. I lift the hose high in the air and even more water flows into the bowl I use for that purpose. ----- Quick facts - - It's packed really well, it will take you more than a few minutes to get it out of all the packing. -I have this on a cart that is 19x27.5 . It fits great with about 5 inches left on the end, and an inch in the front. Make sure it is a sturdy kitchen cart I would recommend. It would not fit under my cabinets, I needed one more inch. -When you first get it out of the box and before you start doing the dishes on a regular basis the drain hoses will be less pliable, just make sure that the connections on the back are tight before you turn the water on and you will be good to go. The second time I used it some water sprayed out because we had been moving the hoses to drain the extra water. -You do have to change your faucet head. (!!!!!!) ( They supply the one you need ! ) If you've already had a portable dishwasher you already know this. A cheapy faucet in general is probably the only way you will be making the new connection fit easily. It just screws on to your faucet head fairly easily if you have a regular plain old faucet. We actually had to take out the faucet we had before for a cheaper version, but that was worth it not to do dishes by hand and being that we didn't want to tear out cabinets and pay someone to install a built in. - Read the placement chart for the dishes. Big plates go up front and they should fit fine. I do cups on the side, bowls along the back along with small plates where I can fit them. - The water usage is listed as liters on the cycle chart in the manual, not gallons. A normal wash will use about 3.5 gallons of water, or 13.6 liters. ------------------------- When we first got it and my husband looked inside he asked \"do you like this ?\" with a note of pessimism. And I was unsure at first because it was smaller. I've gone from a full size portable to this size after the first one broke fairly quickly. This size works well for a family of 4. Sometimes I do 2-3 loads a day. It depends of what I've cooked. Usually it's 1-2. It might be small, but it cleans the dishes well. Cycle info - You can do a regular load of lightly soiled dishes with milk and juice residue, crumbs and ketchup, in 50 minutes on the light cycle that doesn't have a dry time. It's called speed and it is 30 minutes less than light, it just doesn't take 30 minutes to dry the dishes. So a lot of times, that will work for me. When you open the the door a lot of steam escapes and they get dry quickly enough on their own. The normal cycle has 3 pre rinses, and 1 wash cycle, and 2 rinses. The speed cycle has 2 pre-rinses and 1 wash cycle and 1 rinse. I've used all kinds of detergent and they all work well. I am using a powder at the moment. And also, I think it is common sense that you have to be careful that the spatula or other objects don't obstruct the spinning arm below the basket. It could maybe use a few more well placed built in metal tines if I could think of any improvements. I bought a square trade warranty after my last issue with a portable, not sure that I will need it, but you can search for the appliance one for the 250-300 dollar coverage.", "id": "3741271"}

I bought it over a year ago, and wanted to wait a while before reviewing to see how well it held up over time. The short story is that I absolutely love it, and really have no complaints. Here are some details: -Setup was fairly simple, but I did have to have my brother lift it onto the counter (I'm not very strong). Otherwise, putting the few pieces together was a snap. -I was concerned about taking the attachment on and off the faucet, but it is extremely easy and only takes a second. -My water comes out very hot in my apartment, so I've never had an issue but I would make sure the water is hot for use. -The booklet/manual that comes with the dishwasher is actually very helpful, and I use it quite a bit. -If you overload or load things right next to each other, sometimes dishes will not get fully clean. However, this is true with any dishwasher. I have found that you can get creative with what you put in and how. Don't be afraid to experiment. -I have washed everything from tupperware to heavy pots and pans with success. -If you let food dry on dishes, it may not come off if you just put it in without presoaking/scrubbing. If you put dishes in immediately and just scrape excess food off before hand, they get squeaky clean. No pre-scrubbing needed. -It's never broken down. -Easy to clean. -It runs quietly, and beeps when it's finished. -TURN OFF THE FAUCET BEFORE DETACHING THE HOSE. May seem like common sense, but common sense hasn't stopped me from being sprayed in the face a couple times... -The setting I generally use takes about an hour and a half to finish. Honestly, I have said numerous times this dishwasher was the best $250 I ever spent in my life. I use it all the time, and it makes my life so much easier.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I ordered this dishwasher based on other reviews. I was a little worried that a small dishwasher with one arm wouldn't do that great of a job. Having owned a chinese washing machine that attached to the sink, I was also worried about water leaks. As it turns out, neither of those were issues. This dishwasher did a great job cleaning up week old dishes that had been sitting in my sink, and the combined faucet/drain (pictures on the supentown web site) means that you don't have to worry about water going everywhere as long as it's been installed properly. The faucet adapter also has an aerator, so you don't have to take it off to make the water come out evenly when you aren't using the dishwasher. If I had any quibble, it would be that it uses more space than I'd like, but I can't imagine them making it any smaller and still fitting full sized plates. It's easy to detach from the sink, so I can probably stow it away when it's not in use.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I got my dishwasher a couple months ago. Initially easy to set up. I was able to set it up myself without my husband's help. The only problem I have is that it does have a slow leak from the back hose where it connects to the machine. I tighten it all the way but it still leaks. I contacted the manufacturer and they were UNBELIEVABLY helpful. I spoke with LEWIS from Sun Pen Town (SPT) several times. They sent me new parts right away. The only thing I had to do was email my proof of purchase. DONE! I really love the dishwasher. It washes dishes well. We do have to get creative when we arrange our dishes. There is an opening on the right where the water comes out, so if you have any LARGE dishes that block that opening, they won't wash completely! Overall, despite the initial problem, I still love the washer. It sure beats washing them all by hand! I'd recommend the company alone due to the amazing quality of customer service. ***For anyone who mentioned the manual doesn't contain manufacturer information... when you're looking straight at the machine, open the door and it's on the right inside of the door. Or go to sunpentown.com***", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "Wasn't quite sure what to expect with this dishwasher. For all intents and purposed couldn't ask for anything better. Arrived well packaged, very easy setup. Did so after dinner, had kids put dishes aside while I cleaned the counter space and hooked it all up and had to buy the rinse and detergent aid. By the time I had it ready, the left over remants of cheesy mashed potatoes were well dried on the kids plates. Completely clean and sparkly after the cycle was complete. Works very well on counter top, quick release to the water tap is a snap. LOve it.. Will update if any problems arise...so far no leaks for the get go..", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I am a bachelor living in a small two bedroom apartment by myself but I regularly have guests over. For the last nine years I've frequently had my tiny sink overwhelmed with toppling over piles of dirty dishes from having company and all too often it would take a few days, working an hour or more each day to get them cleaned by hand. I've worn out countess scrubbers and sponges over the years and worse yet, the dishes weren't even getting cleaned very well. It got to the point I actually dreaded the dish cleaning aftermath of having friends over for meals so much I wouldn't invite them as often. This was the solution I wish I had known about all along. It does an excellent job of washing for me. I have hard water here and with the right rinse agent and detergent tweaks this unit cleans spotless. Some tips not in other reviews: Tip 1 If you don't want to hook this to your faucet you don't have to. My apartment is unusual in that there's a laundry washer hook up in the corner of my kitchen. I have a single unit laundry washer/dryer there. This dishwasher fits perfectly on top of that. So instead of using the cheesy faucet device I instead elected to hook the unit directly to the water mains for the washer through a splitter. This involves taking the inlet hose to your local hardware store and asking them to adapt it to a garden hose type connection. You may need to cut off the small end that screws into the faucet adapter to do this. (I had to) If you do, cut it off with enough hose behind it so that you can splice it back together if you ever decide to use the faucet adapter. (Or just buy a new hose for that purpose) While at the hardware store you'll also need a garden hose type connection splitter so that the laundry washer and the dish washer can share the same connection. The laundry washer water hookup stays on and pressurized all the time so make sure you use teflon tape on every connection. The drain hose is just sent to the same drain the laundry washer uses, usually there's no need to screw the connector into anything, you just shove the end of the hose into the drain pipe. Tip 2 You can hook this unit up to the cold water side of the mains (or with cold water from your faucet) if you want to. I noticed that many reviews here say to turn the faucet on to hot and run it for a while before hooking up the dishwasher. I ended up reading that after I had already permanently hooked the unit to the cold water spout. However, I also noticed that in the manual each cleaning cycle has a listed running temperature. The only way that could be so regulated is if the unit heats the water by itself, and it does. Even though only cold water is hooked up the dishes are still steaming at the end of a cycle (with no drying selected), so you don't have to have hot water at all for the unit to clean hot. Tip 3 The silverware basket can be unsnapped in half. I find I don't usually have enough silverware for a full basket. If you look closely at the basket you will see theres two separate cages that snap in place on the handle. If you remove one of these cages you can recover a nice chunk of space in the dishwasher to use for other stuff. You can also relocate the silverware basket to a less congested spot at your convenience. This trick made the difference between being able to wash a big pan of mine or not. Altogether I couldn't ask for a better dishwasher. As a single guy in an apartment its like it was made just for me. Life is easier. Now I've recovered all those hours I would've spent slaving at the sink to do the things I'd much rather be doing, like writing long Amazon reviews! :)", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "Have had this for 4 months, no problems, no leaks, daily use. It is very quiet, weirdly it is actually somewhat soothing, like a womb sound. Read and follow the instructions on loading and recommended detergent. Rinse items well before loading, not because this can't handle it, but because you will have to clean it less. If you follow the instructions you can wash a good amount of dishes and they will be very clean. Use the small soap container for liquid, very little soap is plenty for this machine, its very efficient. The default wash cycle is the right wash cycle for default. Two button start up...beep beep on. It takes some time to wash, 90 minutes ish. We have this on a counter next to the sink. Nice to have a dishwasher at sink height, makes loading much easier. If you have washing machine connectors in your kitchen (we did), get an adapter for a garden hose to a smaller hose, there is one in Home Depot that fits. It is a very tight squeeze. Lock it off with a hose clamp. Attach to the cold water spigot wrapped with 1 layer of silicon plumbers tape. Cut the straight end off the stock hose with a utility knife. Be sure to leave the angled end intact. Connect the angled end to the dishwasher. Connect the angled end of the drain hose onto the dishwasher and the other end as deep in the drain as you can get it. Test the first cycle with a large bucket handy to make sure your drain flows adequately, else snake your drain. Check the connections in the back for leakage. Tighten again occasionally. Once you get this dialed in and tight and if you prerinse it is no maintenance.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "Had a bit of a hard time setting it up but once we purchased some plumber's tape it runs very well with no leaks (highly recommend you get a roll of plumber's tape before your dishwasher arrives). The problems we had were after the first few times we ran dishes through it though, they were not coming out clean looking at all! When it wasn't full I looked inside and tried spinning the washing arm around and noticed that it kept hitting the bottom of the dish rack. To fix this problem I built up the tracks where the dish rack wheels rested with Sugru (an awesome play-doh like product that dries hard and water proof, you can use to \"hack\"/fix tricky problems and you can buy it on amazon too)so that the dish rack rested higher up. This fixed the problem completely but in the end I could've fixed this with a little push... one day immediately after a super hot load of dishes finished washing I unloaded the dishwasher and noticed the bottom of the dishwasher was draining funny and looked kind of warped so I very gently pushed on the bottom where it was sticking up and it went *POP* back into place. Must have been a weird fluke and somehow got messed up in shipping or something? I agree with other reviews, it does look a bit like a fancy microwave and it is very quiet. Plus, I love not having to do dishes in the sink anymore and this fits easily in a corner of our counter.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "These are soft and absorbent, work well as dish towels and hand towels. The washing instructions say cold, but I've been washing them in hot water and drying with highest setting, they haven't shrunk and have kept their shape. I ordered two more packages.", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "These towels are pretty, fun and efficient! The organic and Earth-conscious product description definitely grabbed my attention, pushing me to choose these over a number of other candidates for dish drying towels. I love nature, and it's not only in the product description but also designed into the towels, which just help to remind the user of the Earth, I think. After a month, and one or two washes, they are just as bright as I can remember and they dry really as-described well. At home I use them to dry off fruit and at work I use them to dry off my few work dishes and sometimes my fruit as well. Also, at work, I tend to dry off my dishes multiple times at different points during the day, and I haven't noticed any decline in the drying power over the course of the day. The towel hardly even feels damp at the end of the day, and I store it in a closed drawer between uses. The feeling I get from using and just having these towels around were definitely worth the 'extra' money, and they've more than met expectations from a utility standpoint as well.", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "I bought this today when it went on sale, after months of dithering and arguing with myself, thinking, why does one person need a dishwasher. Answer? I HATE DOING DISHES. And I hate the clutter of a sink full of dirty dishes and cups and silverware. See, I'm a shift-worker. And let's face it, I hate housework. The last thing I want to do on a day off is the darned dishes. Also my kitchenette is tiny - 7 feet square. With a full sized stove and fridge, my counter-space is pretty much limited to a 2 foot square area to the right of the sink. The left side is where the dish rack used to live. Well no more. Now the dishwasher sits there and hums along quietly. I love this thing. It holds a week's worth of stuff, it cleans them just fine on the 45 minute speed cycle, it only uses a reported 12 litres/3 gallons of hot water per full cycle, so I assume it's less on the speed cycle, and everything comes out shiny and clean. It's about 1/2 the size of an 18\" dishwasher, it has one rack with a little side top rack that folds down for mugs, the cutlery tray is partitioned and can be removed easily if you want to throw in some pots, it's quiet, and dead easy to put together and hook up to the sink. Just keep in mind, it's NOT small - it's 17 and 1/4 inches tall by 21 inches wide by 19 inches deep. It does have a certain looming presence. But I don't care. It does the darned dishes! And the new reduced height means it fits under my cupboards. This is the newer model without the viewing window, which means lesser chance of seal failure. I used teflon tape when I attached the hoses and so far so good. I will report back in a couple months when I get the electric bill, but I bet it's about the same as handwashing. Well ok, it's electric, so maybe not, but I DON'T CARE, it's a dishwasher and I feel like a real grownup now. For just under 200 bucks, you can't go wrong. And I got a full one-year warranty with purchase, for free. I love it. I guess that's a bit ridiculous to say, but it's the next best thing to a live-in butler! If only it loaded itself..... ah well one day.....", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I bought this month ago, I've used it about 40 times now. Its been a good dishwasher and I have only a couple suggestions for someone who is looking to purchase this Dishwasher. To my knowledge none of the counter top dishwashers have a heat element to dry your dishes. The Trick is you open up the washer right after its finished, leave it open a couple inches and let all the steam out while everything is still hot and they dry nicely. Make sure there is no standing water on top of things other wise that will come back and get you. This is a compact washer. Large dishes are hard to fit! I use it every night cause I can only fit about 4 glasses, 3-4 medium plates, the silverware and maybe a small pot. So keep that in mind. Pre wash your dishes a bit, if its dried on to the plate or pan its probably not going to come off. It will on a second cycle most of the time from what I've experienced. Works best when you clear the table and put everything straight into the dishwasher and use it right then. Other than that, its been a good little dishwasher and I would recommend it to a friend.", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "Before I bought this product, I had many doubts and it was hard to find this information. I waited 2 months of daily use to give this review, to be sure about the product, and here is the information that I will clarify for you: * 1) Size of the dishes * 2) How does it drain? * 3) Type of detergent I had to check all this, because I didn't have the necessary conditions to have the dishwasher. For starters, it didn't fit under my counter-top, and my university (I live in the campus residences) doesn't allow us to make changes to the furniture instalments. Hereare the adaptations I made, and I got to tell you that the dishwasher is an excellent product. It leaves everything so clean, dry and I don't have to waste my time washing dishes any more. 1) First I had a Corelle dinnerware with squared dishes (the model is called bamboo leaf, if it is any reference to anybody). Well, they didn't fit right in the dishwasher. I had do lean them over a bit and leave one space free between every plate, which made me use the double of the space and if the plate was too near the detergent dispenser, sometimes it wouldn't open properly and it will make a mess. So, in the end, I changed the dinnerware and bought another Corelle with round plates and it worked perfectly (I bought it for $20 in a great sale of Walmart)! the dishes fit neatly and I can wash the whole set in one go, and it leaves enough free space for glasses and some other dishes (the model of the dinnerware that I bought is the 'Corelle® livingware™ squared 16-pc dinnerware set', which has rounded plates, and the size description is: Squared 16-Piece Set includes 4 each: 10-1/4\" Dinner Plates, 6-3/4\" Bread & Butter Plates, 18-oz Soup / Cereal Bowls, 11-oz Stoneware Mugs. 2) To drain it has a pump inside. This was important for me because the dishwasher didn't fit under my counter-top, so I bought a small table with wheels and put the dishwasher there. So, My counter-top has the same original free space, which is great, and I only move the table once a day to plug the dishwasher to the kitchen's faucet (it is super easy to connect because it has a very convenient adapter, so you plug it and unplug it in less than 5 seconds), and the rest of the time the table is in a free space in my kitchen next to a wall. The important thing here is that the draining is done trough a pump, so it doesn't matter that the table is about 15 cm lower than the sink, it always drains properly. 3) The type of detergent is VERY important. This dishwasher doesn't heat water as much as others, for which it is very important to buy a detergent that works at temperatures of 50ºC (122 F). I first bought a gel cheap detergent and didn't read that it worked for temperatures over 60ºC, and the dishes came out a bit dirty. So, in the end I bought the 'Finish Quantum tablets' and it leaves the dishes sparkling clean! they come out perfect and bright, and I haven't pre-washed any of my dishes ever! I only take out big pieces of leftovers, put the dishes inside, and that's about it. Although, I have to mention this: I had to make a small adaptation, because the tablets are a bit big to fit in the dispenser, so I broke the small plastic that divided the two sections of the detergent dispenser so that the tablet fitted and could come out comfortably. I really love this product, and I recommend it to anybody!", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "My wife picked this out for our son for one of his Christmas presents. Yes I know that sounds like a kind of odd thing for a kid to get as a present, but one of his chores he does is the dishes and he was always saying how we should get a dishwasher. Not having the room in our kitchen really for a big dishwasher, my wife found this online. I had never even heard of a counter top dishwasher before. I was skeptical. Well Christmas day comes and he was happy to unwrap it. I as the Dad, was tasked at setting it up. It really was very simple. Screw a couple of hoses onto the back of the machine and then screw an adapter onto my faucet. I followed the directions and put in some rinse aid and detergent. Stacked the dishes in according to the picture in the manual and off we went. It really works wonderfully. It's super quiet. Kind of soothing to listen to the sounds of it. It cleans everything perfectly. Doesn't always get everything dry, but if you follow everyone else's suggestions of cracking it open when it's done, they finish air drying quickly. We can fit quite a bit of dishes in this thing, and I've even put pots and pans, and a colander with some sticky noodles that I couldn't rinse out in, and they came out cleaner than ever. I really can't find any cons with this, but maybe one minor gripe. The rinse aid fill cap/area is kind of a messy situation and the \"eye\" to see if you have any in there, either doesn't work on ours or is super hard to read. Also, ours came with two dents on the side, doesn't effect the use of it, but was kind of odd that the box was in ok shape.

{"review": "I have had an EdgeStar dishwasher for around 3.5 years now and I decided it was about time I wrote a review. Why? Because in all this time, this appliance has never given me any trouble and it still works perfectly. I honestly expected to have it for a short time as it's a compact appliance. I did not have much faith in it. But after this long, I have to say it did surprise me. It still washes dishes quite perfectly. It works better when I remember to put the dry-in liquid in the back. And while it's true that I kind of clean them well before putting them in, it's probably mostly because I am a little OCD. So I haven't tried putting super dirty dishes yet and can't testify on that. I must say it did work funny once, a couple of years ago, if I remember correctly the water didn't come down. But somehow it corrected itself (!) and this never happened again. Another thing is that you can't fit that much in, so if you have a family of 4-6 it's probably on the small side. For me and my current needs, it has the ideal size. So, although my model is not the digital one, my guess is this one must be just as good. I highly recommend the EdgeStar dishwasher.

{"review": "After living in tiny apartments in Hawaii for 5 years while I was a bachelor in the Navy, and having to hand wash all my dishes, I moved into a small house that didn't have a dishwasher and I said \"No more!\". If you have a habit of eating out because of the inconvenience of having to hand wash all your dishes, like any dishwasher, this will rather quickly wind up paying for itself several times over - granted, that could be said of any dishwasher. So, specifically about this one: One of the things a lot of people criticize in the reviews here is that the shortest setting is 10 minutes for a freshwater rinse, or for a regular wash cycle you can use the 45 minute cycle - many seem to complain that there isn't a mid-length cycle in between these. Well, it's true that some dishwashers have one, but generally speaking, most don't and take somewhere between 30-60 minutes to wash a load. I think there is a tendency to think that because the unit is compact and does smaller loads, that it might inherently do them faster - I understand where this presumption comes from, but if you think about it, that really doesn't make sense and it's actually normal and acceptable that the unit takes just as long as any other basic model dishwasher for a full and proper wash cycle. I'm not trying to criticize people for wanting a shorter cycle, I'm just saying, for those of you considering buying a mini-dish washer, it would be wise to adjust your expectations accordingly - they're generally smaller, but that doesn't mean faster. It does internally heat the water which really helps dissolve the soap and wash away greasy dishes. I haven't actually used the longer wash cycles (70 minutes, and 1hr 45 minutes I think?) because I always just soak my pots and pans in the sink anyway - but normal dishes as clean as could be on the shorter, 45 minute wash cycle. I just give things a quick rinse before I put them in there, but I don't pre soak normal dishes or anything, and they always come out perfect, peanut butter, pasta sauce, wine, tea, coffee - everything comes out sparkling. I even use only half the detergent recommended, Costco dish-washing powder, (it's my habit to minimize, reduce, and conserve), but everything always comes out great anyway. I have high mineral well-water, so doing a load daily, I add a half cup of white vinegar to the start of a cycle once a week to keep the nice steel interior clean and looking new. The clearance between the wash arm at the bottom and the rack is a little smaller than full sized dishwashers, I've found it wise to bump it with my finger to make sure it doesn't strike any dishes sticking down below the rack before I start it up to wash a load - just as one might with any other dishwasher. The good: -Not noisy, operates and a comfortable 'medium-quiet' volume. i.e. it's not near-silent like a $2000 stainless steel European dishwasher, but it also doesn't roar disruptively. I'm in college and study in the room next to the open kitchen while it's running, so if that's any indicator? -It's stainless steel inside, which I thought was a nice touch of quality, especially for an affordable, compact model. -It's smaller and does smaller loads (which is the purpose, right?) but all around, I don't find that one has to sacrifice anything for the convenience of having this compact model. Same sound, same wash, same soap, smaller size - that's it. The bad: My only \"complaint\" is that if you disconnect the hose while it's washing in order to use your kitchen faucet for something real quick, and then reconnect it and forget to turn the water back on, the dishwasher will beep and show an \"E1\" error on the display when it tries to do it's next rinse, but it won't resume washing if you hear the beep and then turn the water on - rather, you'll get the beep, the \"E1\" error message (which means no water pressure), and then have to reset the 45 minute wash cycle back to the beginning and start over. This is being very nit-picky, and I'm not really trying to make a complaint out of it, as generally, I start it before I go to bed so I've only caused this interruption twice and it really didn't inconvenience me when it happened anyway. I'm really not actually mentioning it to \"complain\" about it, but it seemed relevant to mention for you all to set your expectations accordingly, since that's what reviews of good products are really for (my opinion). With that, I am content to give it 5 stars and think that overall, you'll enjoy and appreciate this thing - I've genuinely been very happy with it across the board. I hope this helps. :)", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I received this counter-top dishwasher for Christmas, on the same day I was to prepare a standing rib roast, 2 whole chickens, and country style ribs and all the fixings for 10 people. Needless to say, I put this dishwasher through its paces that night. Yes, I had to reload several times, but for once I could entertain while my dishes were being done. I also have to admit I shoved several dishes into the EdgeStar 6 which wasn't necessarily \"recommended\" by the manufacturer, but they came out sparkling. I had a little issue with cloudy residue on my dishes which was easily remedied by cutting down my detergent in half (which makes sense, considering the machine itself is half the size of a conventional dishwasher). I had purchased a tub of Cascade complete pacs and found that if I cut them in half and saved the other half for the next washing, the dishes turned out perfectly. On one occasion, my dishwasher leaked from behind at the hose connection. Now, before I do a load, I quickly check the hoses are securely tightened (super easy to do) and have not had a problem since. Cleaning the interior, filters, and wash arm is effortless. The stainless steel interior does not hold odors and cleans easily as well. This dishwasher is easy to connect and disconnect from the faucet, just remember to turn off the water before disconnecting. It is not as much a tragedy if this happens, but comedic...and you will probably never forget to turn off the water again. The Edgestar 6 is not overly noisy. The only time it may be noticeable is when water is discharged into the sink. I take advantage of the water discharge by putting dirty dishes waiting for the next load that need to be rinsed under were the water discharges! Can't do that with a regular dishwasher. The pause function is very useful and I have been thankful for this feature SEVERAL times. I have been very pleased with my Edgestar 6 and highly recommend it for small families, empty nesters, or someone who does not want to spend the money for a built in dishwasher. As far a compromised counter-space, it's small enough to move it if you need to (or get a rolling cart).", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "I expect part of the reason I give this product five stars is because I hate washing dishes so much and am so relieved not to feel irritated with my sweetie when he doesn't do his share. Sure, there are trivial annoying things about this machine, i.e. the tine lay out in the dishwasher rack could be better, the shortest wash cycle is 45 min., and there is no mechanism to tuck the hose away in the back (though you can coil it). You will periodically want to re-tighten/check the hoses in the back of the machine; ours loosened once due to coiling the hose and it started leaking a bit, though it was nothing dramatic. Also, it is sort of a big hulking machine that takes up a chunk of space not very prettily (you will definitely want to measure before ordering); the exterior is a silvery plastic *not* stainless steel (a little cheap looking). However, I love everything else about this machine. It does exactly what it's supposed to. It washes dishes. It sterilizes them. Plus, it's not too loud, it hooks up easily to my sink, it is simple to operate, and uses very little water/energy. It fits more dishes than I expected. We are a two person household, and he works from home. In two days we generate just a few more dishes than it has capacity for, so I'm running it every day about 2/3 full, while hand-washing pots and pans. We just scrape the dishes and put them right in without rinsing first (for the most part), and I've found the \"everyday cycle\" (85 min.) to get the dishes perfectly clean. Just so you know, it *just* fits our 10 1/2 inch dinner plates, we have to squeeze them through; it certainly will not fit anything taller! Also, if you need to use the tap while it's washing you can easily pause the cycle between water intake/draining, unhook, re-hook, and restart. Or, for a quick rinse, just use the water pressure release button with the tap on. The display shows exactly how much time is left in the cycle. When it's done washing it beeps about four times, not too loudly, and then sits quietly until you turn it off and disconnect it (which is why I didn't go with another model that apparently would beep every five minutes once it was done; I abhor beeping). Like everyone says, it doesn't have a true dry cycle (few counter top dishwashers do), and just cracking it open while the dishes are still warm let's them air dry fine. For those who are wondering what that 3 in 1 cycle is for, that's just if you want to use those detergent gel packs. We don't, and it still works great, though I did invest in some Jetdry since everyone else said it made a difference. Frankly, I can't tell, but I don't pay close attention. All in all, I am very satisfied and pleased with my purchase!", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "I have NEVER had a dishwasher. The places I've chosen to live in on my own seem to have been built before 1920, so they aren't especially roomy or up-to-date with big appliance hook-ups. HOWEVER, when I had a baby I started worrying that the baby's items weren't getting properly sanitized by hand-washing due to some very brainwashing-type articles in a parenting magazine. I stayed with my mom on vacation for a few weeks and was blown away by her dishwasher and its efficiency in cleaning the baby's MANY, MANY random items. To be honest, I was more impressed by the TIME I was saving using her dishwasher to clean the baby's items and it was nice to have non-dishwashing hands. So even though I am pretty frightened of large appliances and anything requiring a hose (call me crazy,) I saw Compact Appliance was a reputable company and decided to take a chance on this. I bought the least expensive solid-looking dishwasher, which was this one at the time. I also used a discount code at the time so I only spent a little over 200 on it. If you are like me, you are worried how you are going to get this thing working, like connecting the machine, lifting it where it needs to go, hooking up the water (my biggest fear) and plugging it in (not so difficult-you just plug it in.) Well the machine is heavy. But I was able to lift it. I am 5' 8 and sort of strong. It would not fit under my cabinet, which would have been ideal, so I got a good heavy cart that accommodated the entire size of the machine and set it up about 2 full cabinets away from the kitchen sink. It isn't ideal, but it IS better with a dishwasher than without one. After I screwed the hoses on the back of the machine and lifted it onto the cart (really, this was the hardest part) all I had to do was attach it to the faucet. They send a little adapter WITH the dishwasher that you screw right onto the kitchen faucet. I leave the adapter on when I am using my sink for things other than dishwashing. That way, I can just attach the hose really quick when i am washing dishes and be done with it. I ended up using the entire length of the hose provided. It was a perfect fit, so I REALLY lucked out. It is great. Once I took the attaching contraption off with the water still running. I was totally wet, so remember to turn your water off at the faucet before detaching the hose. I didn't know what I was doing but I learned soon after. It is like a rite of passage I think for a new portable dishwasher owner. The hose is always out but I am not spending prime time washing dishes all day. They even get about 50% dry. I usually open the dishwasher, and pull the \"drawer\" out as soon as the cycle is finished even if i don't plan on unloading the dishwasher right then. AND, the machine is a good washer. I test it all the time, and I wash everything in here. I am addicted to washing dishes and basically anything in it. It never lets me down. It is my rock. I have learned to just use the 1:40 setting all the time. It is kind of silly that it is pictured with a 1:50 setting. There is NO 1:50 setting. There is a 1:40 setting and a few shorter ones. If I don't use the 1:40 setting, I always wonder if the dishes could be cleaner. Plus it produces a very fresh clean kitchen smell after the full 1:40 cycle. I think I might be addicted to that smell also. It was the best money I could have spent. I love this machine, it is truly my best friend. Anything I have thrown at it, it cleans. I have actually kissed this machine once after putting a roast pan in it. No way it will clean this roast pan, I thought. I thought wrong. The pan looks better than it EVER has! It is a tad noisy, but it is practically in my living room since my place is small. It puts me AND the baby to sleep, which I'm sure the neighbors appreciate. It's got the loud vacuum effect I guess. In any case, I completely and wholeheartedly recommend this machine to ANYONE. It is a good machine. I use it 2 or 3 times a day for the past month that I have had it. I suppose once the novelty wears off I will use it once in the morning and once at night since I cook a lot (more now that I have this dishwasher!) Buy with 100% confidence and enjoy. Single females do not be afraid like I was! If you live above the first floor the delivery man will do the hardest work for you carrying it up the stairs! I hope my review helps someone that is on the fence like I was. Update: Recently the machine started to not drain. It was not good. But luckily all I had to do was use a wet/dry shop vac a couple of times to empty the water from the machine. After that I unscrewed the hose closest to the right side and shop-vacuumed it. There were a couple of pebble-like objects in there and a sticker from a piece of fruit. I used a pair of pointy jewelry pliers to pry the pieces out. I re-ran the machine and it is fine once again. I was lost without it. This is probably not the best method that professional machinists would use to fix the dishwasher but I wasn't trying to impress anyone. I just wanted to do some dishes.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "After lots of \"price vs. review quality\" research on these types of dishwashers, I went with it. Here's a quick summary - It's extraordinarily quiet. The faucet hook up is extremely easy to use. Very easy to get to and clean filter. There's no leaking. It takes care of ALL of my dishes. Surprising amount of space inside. Dishes are clean almost every single time (nothing you wouldn't expect from a normal household dishwasher). The selection of wash cycles is awesome, although the ones that work best are over an hour (but that doesn't bother me at all). It has a special feature if I chose to use those little Cascade packets you can drop in. Manual was extremely clear. I recommend a youtube video or two to learn how to put it together, just to make sure. To dry dishes, just leave the unit open for a little while. No problem there. And added bonus - it fits right under my sink and the hose is long enough to stretch up to the faucet. So I don't have to move it or set it out where I have to see it all the time, which was a concern. This thing is literally, f***ing amazing. Not a single problem. And I'm... two months in? If somebody stole it in my sleep, I'd buy another one without question.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "We are loving our dishwasher! It was super easy to set up and instructions were clear. The quick-release hookup to the faucet is legitimately a one-second operation without requiring any tightening or anything. The adapter that stays permanently on the faucet is a universal type that works on a few different types of threads; ours is an IKEA faucet that's a bit unusual in its fittings, and I was anticipating having to buy something to make it work, but didn't have to. The only thing I don't love is that only the fastest/lightest setting has no drying heat -- it doesn't let you turn off the drying heat on the heavier settings. Not a big deal though, because I don't imagine I'd run it without being home, so I can just turn it off and open the door once it gets to the dry setting. I haven't tried washing anything like a baking pan yet, but the 45-minute \"light\" setting got regular dinner dishes clean. Oh, the fittings on the back where the hoses go are standard fittings, so it would also be possible to hook it into your water lines for a permanent install, if desired. I might do this in the future.", "id": "3741271"}
{"review": "First, the good points: - If the most important thing about a dishwasher is that it gets dishes clean without a lot of pre-scrubbing on your part, this machine excels. The pots & pans cycle, which I find myself using most of the time (though it takes an hour and 40 minutes, 15 minutes longer than the standard cycle) does indeed scrub off all but the most stubborn baked-on gunk. It provides a good hot-water rinse to sterilize the dishes, and efficiently dries everything but plastic items like tupperware. Using a quality detergent is key: I use Cascade gel. I've found it's essential to use rinse aid if you want the dishes dried thoroughly; I use Jet-Dry. The other, shorter cycles -- for stemware and the like -- don't seem to do as good a job either at cleaning or drying the dishes. The 10-minute rinse & hold cycle is useful as a pre-wash, and to bring hot water through the pipes in the house so the regular cycle starts with hot water. - Noise level -- it's very quiet. - Looks -- It really is a beautiful machine. - Price -- cheaper than most good standard-size machines, and far less than other odd-size dishwashers (like narrow units). Now, the shortcomings: - The maximum diameter of plates and lids that fit efficiently, so they stand up straight, is 9\". Is your dinnerware only 9\" wide? My plates are 10-1/2\", and they have to be angled so severely that it dramatically reduces the number of items I can put in. I shouldn't have to go out and buy all new dinnerware just to accommodate my tiny dishwasher. - The tines that hold things in place are all wrong: most of my glassware doesn't easily fit without tipping over, and there's a weird gap in the tines that's only good for a small piece of bakeware -- and even that slides around. Tines that allow you to fold them down or adjust their angle would have been nice.", "id": "3741271"}

{"review": "Are you in the market for a $16 smallish fan? Then you are probably trying to decide between the Honeywell Chillout and the Honeywell TurboForce. I have both and like both, but both are suited for slightly different settings. In a nutshell, the Chillout pushes less air but has quieter operation (and a more pleasing tone, but that is subjective); and, the Honeywell has more options (tilt, 3 speed settings) and a more stable base (and as you can guess pushes more air with it's larger fan blades and is louder). So in the end you need to decide which fan will work better for you. Air Flow: Winner = Tie - (+1 Honeywell) Based upon my observations the Honeywell low setting produces airflow in between the low and high setting on the Chillout. The medium setting on the Honeywell gives more airflow than the high setting on the Chillout. The high setting on the Honeywell give more airflow than can be achieved by the Chillout. - (+1 Chillout) As a consequence of this, however, the Chillout allows you to have a truly low setting for those instances you just want a touch of airflow. The Honeywell is still pretty powerful at its lowest setting. For us, this comes in handy in our daughter's room. This way our baby monitor (audio only) is not overpowered by the strong gust/sound from the Honeywell. Now my daughter is allowed to use a fan overnight - with the Honeywell, we would shut it off before going to bed. Sound: Winner = Chillout - Chillout: 80 decibels (dB) directly in front of the fan, 70 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 45 dB about three feet to the side of the fan. - Honeywell: 80 dB directly in front of the fan, 75 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 50 dB about three feet to the side of the fan. - As I mentioned above, I fell the tone of the sound from the Chillout is closer to white noise, whereas the Honeywell motor overpowers the sound and is higher pitched. The Honeywell sound is not annoying, just louder and less pleasing (for those that like white noise). Stability: Winner = Honeywell - The Honeywell has a solid base that allows uniform distribution of weight across the entire base. It sits well in window sills with extended platforms in front. - The Chillout has a pair of feet in the front that is connected by a cross bar. The back is a fin similar to the front feet, but pointing backwards. The depth of the Chillout is slightly less than the Honeywell. I thought this might add to stability when used in a window sill or the platform in front of a window if you have one; however, I did not find this to be the case. I found that with the feet design, the Chillout has a more concentrated distribution of weight and therefore has a tendency to slip and fall to the side when used in situations that are not perfectly stable. - Case in point - our windows have platforms that sit in front of the window. They run about four and a half inches wide. The Honeywell sits on these with not problem despite extending about an inch or so beyond the platform. The Chillout, despite being only about a half inch beyond the platform, want to fall forward and off the platform because of the shape and position of the front feet and lack of other contact points. We have to use something underneath the fan to extend the effective platform width to keep the fan in place. This review is re-posted as a Chillout review.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "The LASKO 42-INCH WIND CURVE tower fan is a good, reliable fan that does an excellent job cooling our large family room. The recent heat wave (still going on here in Maryland) sent me in search of a fan to supplement our air conditioning and ceiling fan. After reading tons of reviews here on Amazon, I settled on this one - and so far I'm pleased. Pros: 1) The fan comes assembled - only the base needs to be attached (you'll need a Phillips-head screwdriver). I had no trouble getting the two halves of the base to fit together, and then attaching it to the fan itself. The instructions are clear. No problems at all. 2) Operating the fan is easy - whether with the remote control (included) or by using the buttons on the top of the fan. You will need to pick up two AAA batteries for the remote. The buttons are coded with icons to make it easy to turn on the fan, switch speeds, and add oscillation or the ionizer feature. 3) Great job circulating air, with or without using oscillation -- when combined with the ceiling fan in our family room, it really does feel like we're surrounded with comfortable spring breezes! 4) Very, very quiet - in fact, it's much quieter than the little $20 fans we've placed around the room in the past to circulate the air. I hardly notice that it's on at all. Cons: 1) It's a bit large and a tad top-heavy - the base is light-weight plastic, which makes the fan seem a bit top-heavy, especially on thick carpet. So far, we haven't had a problem with this, but I could see it falling over easily if someone bumped into it. 2) Oscillation range is fairly small -- it works fine for two people sitting on the sofa watching TV, but it isn't a wide enough range to effectively reach an entire room full of people. It works for us, since it's usually just my husband and myself. But if you're looking for something that oscillates from one side of the room to the other, this might not be the fan for you. That's about it - if you're looking for a good fan for a reasonable price, I suggest ordering one of these. It's classy-looking too!", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "The LASKO 42-INCH WIND CURVE tower fan is a good, reliable fan that does an excellent job cooling our large family room. The recent heat wave (still going on here in Maryland) sent me in search of a fan to supplement our air conditioning and ceiling fan. After reading tons of reviews here on Amazon, I settled on this one - and so far I'm pleased. Pros: 1) The fan comes assembled - only the base needs to be attached (you'll need a Phillips-head screwdriver). I had no trouble getting the two halves of the base to fit together, and then attaching it to the fan itself. The instructions are clear. No problems at all. 2) Operating the fan is easy - whether with the remote control (included) or by using the buttons on the top of the fan. You will need to pick up two AAA batteries for the remote.

{"review": "We have only had this fan now for about a week. I will come back and update my review as time passes, but I wanted to get some info out there. I have a toddler and an infant. Why I was not looking for a fan with blades: Fans with blades can be a danger, but so can the heat, so I decided on a tower style fan for our rather small apartment. Standing fans we have had in the past were easily tipped and the front metal plate or sometimes plastic was quick to pop off as it hit the floor blade still going strong. Very scary when your child is just 2 and has tipped the fan. My experience so far: *auto shut off The first day I was quite worried as the fan had tipped (my husband the larger child in the home was playing with it) and it would not turn back on. I became very worried. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Sure enough this fan has a safety so that if it is tipped it will turn off. *durability So far the baby has tackled it with his 26lb body and it has held up. It is just tall enough that my toddler can't yet push the buttons. *noise I didn't really care if the fan was quiet or not, but it was an added bonus that it is very quiet compared to our Lasko box fan. If you aren't looking at the fan you would never know that it is rotating. Also make sure you get the screws in the right place. The diagram is poorly labeled. That may be the problem with some of the fans people are having noise with. There are more holes than there are screws and the diagram suggests that they go into holes that they really don't belong in. I will include a picture of the base so you can see. *cooling factor I was disappointed with the amount of air that it moved, and had I reviewed it on day 1 I would have only given it a 3 stars for that, but I have come to realize that while the air it moves isn't much, the air always blows out cool. I find that on hot humid summer days some fans are just blowing around the hot air. I was surprised to find that this fan seems to always have cool air. No idea how but it does. It also does a much better job cooling a room if you always have it on rotate. If not the air just kind of stagnates. *packaging I was very worried when it arrived as it was in the thin box the fan comes in rather than amazon packaging. It already had holes in it. I will be reviewing in my order the packaging as well and I suggest others do the same so they start packing it better. *ion thing Tried it doesn't seem to change anything other than a blue light comes on. I have no idea what it actually does. Again bought this fan for safety reasons. *overall I am pleased and hope to buy another when funds allow. Update: It has been about a month now and while my toddler has tackled this fan with his full body weight it is still fully functioning. It has only actually crashed once of the many times hitting wood laminate floors. Now that the weather is warmer it is still blowing cooler air than any other fan in our home. Update: One year later; it is still running great and quietly. The toddler has finally stopped tackling it, but it has survived several falls over the year. Update: It is now June 2014 and we own two of these fans and both are going strong despite a toddler and autistic 6 year old who can now reach the buttons. They also survived a trip in a moving truck to our new home. We have more of an open floor plan now, so two doesn't really cut it for the kitchen/dining room/living room space. The air kind of gets lost, so what I do to help them better cool a room is put them on opposite corners and face them at each other. I plan to buy one more so I can have one in every room in the open space. It also doesn't help that our new home has very old crank windows that only open at an angle and only so far.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "One of the other reviewers mentioned that this fan's remote only works if you aim the remote directly at the fan and that you aren't too far away. Wow, were they ever right. You have to aim the remote dead on to the sensor to get it to work, often times pushing the button several times before it does work. We've moved the fan now so that it is past the foot of the bed and I can't use the remote anymore. The fan is too far away. If I want to use the remote in bed, I have to slide all the way to the bottom corner of the bed, lean forward and aim the remote directly at the fan's sensor. It's not worth it anymore, now I just get out of bed to turn it on and off. Kind of defeats the purpose of having the remote. Now, the pros is that it looks great, the sound is even and on the quieter side (but we like the white noise when we sleep), and fairly powerful air movement. You can direct the air pretty accurately. I still feel a great breeze even though it is kinda far away from the bed. The ION feature is really nice and even seems to cool the air in addition to filtering it. Another note: the \"ION\" light is REALLY bright. It was like having a nightlight in our bedroom. Additionally, the plastic cover that goes over the light and indicator panel is kind of transparent, so when I tried covering the light with electrical tape I realized the light isn't just coming out of the \"light hole,\" it's also coming out most of the transparent plastic cover too, which is kinda large. I ended up having to cover about half of the indicator panel with electrical tape and I can still see the light. I wish it would just go off after a certain period of being on, but no such luck. I'm sure me having to use that much electrical tape (which fortunately blends in well) doesn't help the remote sensor issue.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I'm not sure how to review this, really. The package appeared at my doorstep looking the exact way it would if I were to put it in a shopping cart at walmart. Speaking of which, you can get this for $40 from walmart online, but here's the kicker: I literally received this the second day after I ordered it, and I didn't pay any shipping charges at all. If that could happen for all of my shipments, I'd gladly pay the extra $15 every time I ordered online. As for the actual product, I'm torn again. The ionizer is obviously a sham(as in nothing more than a blue light on the machine), because there's no way to actually clean it(and really that's assuming I believed that ionizers worked in the first place). The fan itself is fantastic. It's absolutely huge, and even on low it blows a more than adequate amount of air. I've read some reviews online about this item breaking after about a year of usage, usually the parts that allow it to oscillate, then the fan itself. I see this as being easily fixed by simply keeping it in one position and keeping it on the low setting, which again is beyond adequate. On low this basically pushes the same amount of air as a box fan does on medium, but has a much more natural \"breeze\" feel and does so at about a third of the decibels. Oh, and the remote is awesome. For all my gripes, this is a fantastic product and is well beyond my expectations.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I have never purchased a tower fan before so I have nothing to compare to, but I would say this is a good fan, not great, but good. It does move a ton of air. Maybe even too much, I don't put it on a higher speed than 1 because the 2nd and 3rd speed is very strong and blows papers and other things all around the room. The ionizer I use very little. It gives me a headache, and I have heard nothing but negaitive things about ionizers so I don't use it, but that is not why I purchased this fan anyway. The main reason I chose this fan over other tower fans was for looks. I love the wood on the front, and it looks very pleasing to the eye, unlike most fans. I think one of the worst parts of this fan, unlike previous reviews, is the noise. The fan itself makes little noise but the air it pushes around makes a lot of noise, even at low speeds. It is not something terrible, and can sometimes be relaxing, almost like the sound of a constant breeze or wind, but can sometimes get distracting/annoying Overall I would recommend this fan to anyone who wants to buy a fan with ionizer and great looks. If the ionizer and looks aren't important to you I might go with a cheeper fan.", "id": "3737601"}

The noise would seem to go away every now and then, making me think that it's done, but it would return. I even tried unscrewing the back of the fan, but only a couple of the screws were philips-head and the others were star-shaped... for some reason.

{"review": "I shopped for-seemingly ever trying to find a good deal on a fan with a remote. I'm glad I bought this one. So the fan comes shipped in it's own box which is fully sufficient because it's packed nicely inside with bags and styrofoam blocks. My only gripe is that assembling it is a pain in the butt, you need a screwdriver (preferably a powered one!) because some of the screws go into plastic that is un-tapped (it's best that way it gets a better seal) but it might put a few people off who are not mechanically inclined, but anyone can do it, you just need a screwdriver. You also need two AAA batteries for the remote, the batteries are not included. Once assembled, the buttons are easy to figure out, and memorize, if you're like me, you bought this fan because it has a remote and you can change settings while you're in bed haha. The best thing about this fan, is the oscillate on/off button. When you press it it begins to oscilate in one direction like any normal fan, but if you press it again on and off, it oscillates in teh opposite direction, so you don't have to wait for it to make a full cycle - this is nice because you can pinpoint yourself with the fan from a distance (hey! own your laziness ^_^) There are 3 settings, low, med, and hi; the high is not 'SUPER FAN TURBINE ACTION' or anything, but because it's a standing turbine fan it gives a great channeled sheet of air out. the timer settings are 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours, and you cycle through them with the button on the top or remote (there are LED indicators and a moderate BEEP sound with each button press even when using the remote). Each button makes a single 'BEEP', except when you first turn it on, it makes two beeps, and when you go from Low-Medium-High-Off; when you reach OFF it beeps a long beep. These indicators are helpful when you're pressing the remote and want to quickly make it work without having to listen for the actual fan noise. The oscillate button is on/off. Then there's this little hidden gem, there are two modes you can turn on \"Breeze\" and \"Sleep\". First set the power, low/med/hi, it uses that as a base level- for Breeze, it randomly changes the speed from what I could discern from about 5+ levels and sometimes goes more powerful than 'High', this is great for relaxing or working where it's not super hot. This mode has only one drawback: the randomly changing levels also randomly change the amount of noise coming from the fan, so it might get annoying if you're trying to get to sleep... That's where their \"Sleep\" mode comes in; so the sleep mode (with a little smiley face on a pillow icon) instead of going RANDOM CRAZINESS, goes gently up and down from a step above or below what its' on AND gradually decreases as it does 'cycles'. because the changes in speed are gradual, there is less 'abrupt' noise, making it PERFECT for falling asleep to, hence the 'sleep' name. The first night I used it I tried breeze and it literally woke me up as I was trying to fall asleep; then i tried the sleep mode and have been using it ever since. Okay so there you have it, the fan is dirt cheap for what you get, there's a little cavity in the back of it to store the remote if you don't want to lose it. Enjoy. :) UPDATE: 4/24/2014: The fan lasted 20 months, tonight it squealed a loud yowling noise, and stopped dead. tried cleaning it, powering it on it just spins very slowly and quietly buzzes, it's not stuck, the motor is just shot. The fan was used each night in the summer months last year, and for 3 months this year. I just seem to recall my parents keeping fans year after year for decades - they literally do not make em like they used to. these plastic throwaways are not designed to last. -2 stars UPDATE TO THE UPDATE!: This fan and most all Holmes fans carry a 3 Year Warranty from the Manufacturer (Jarden), after visiting their website and filling out the 'product support' webform (which asks for the usual info, as well as two codes engraved on the power plug prongs) I received an immediate confirmation then a personal email from them within hours - offering to replace the product. they gave me a model number for a replacement (a comparable model with same features) and I confirmed that would be great, immediate response to that with shipping confirmation thanking me for my business, that the warranty for the original fan transfers to the new one, and that it would arrive at my doorstep in 6-8 business days. WOW. That is extremely good service and way beyond expectations (I thought I was going to have to ship the broken one to them). 5 stars, wow, great customer service!!", "id": "3737601"}

I just seem to recall my parents keeping fans year after year for decades - they literally do not make em like they used to. these plastic throwaways are not designed to last. -2 stars UPDATE TO THE UPDATE!: This fan and most all Holmes fans carry a 3 Year Warranty from the Manufacturer (Jarden), after visiting their website and filling out the 'product support' webform (which asks for the usual info, as well as two codes engraved on the power plug prongs) I received an immediate confirmation then a personal email from them within hours - offering to replace the product. they gave me a model number for a replacement (a comparable model with same features) and I confirmed that would be great, immediate response to that with shipping confirmation thanking me for my business, that the warranty for the original fan transfers to the new one, and that it would arrive at my doorstep in 6-8 business days. WOW. That is extremely good service and way beyond expectations (I thought I was going to have to ship the broken one to them). 5 stars, wow, great customer service!!", "id": "3737601"}

This might not have the Ionizer, but at least I feel more significant wind which is the whole purpose of a fan. It has sleep mode and a random mode which I probably will never use, sleep mode basically cycling through the speeds, and random mode is random cycles of speeds. Timer is more basic, but more straight forward then the Lasko, Holmes has only 4 choices, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours. Lasko has 16 options of timers, so it takes 16 clicks to cycle through the timer options which is way too much. Strange thing is, the Holmes had 1 screw hole which was too big for the screw (8 screws total, all the same size), but it still works fine and stable missing 1 screw. All together, I feel like the Lasko is like an luxury car with too many buttons and having a granny driving it slow, where the Holmes is a basic Honda, straight forward and driving like a normal person.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "You are in luck today. This is a direct comparison review between the three most popular currently available twin window fans: Bionaire BW2300 Twin Window Fan with Remote Control Holmes HAWF2043 Twin Window Fan Honeywell HW-628 Enviracaire Twin Window Fan If you are interested in purchasing any of those widow fans, read on... I didn't intend to have to do this review because I didn't intend to purchase more than one of these fans. I can tell you now that all of these fans are super cheaply designed and built and none of these fans are perfect, but in my opinion, one is worse than the others. Holmes HAWF2043 Twin Window Fan: my rating - 3 of 5 stars I first purchased the Holmes HAWF2043 unit. It was lightweight and fit the window nicely although I had trouble with the extender which is located on the right side. The locks for the extender are located on the right side along the top and bottom edge of the fan, which is supremely stupid because as soon as you place the fan in your window frame and put weight on it, the bottom lock locks and you can not move the extender. What rocket scientist thought of this? So you have to unlock the locks before you place the unit in the window AND keep weight off the bottom lock until you have the extender adjusted to where you want it. This maneuver is not so easy, especially at first. Plus, the lock mechanisms can be difficult to move. At the time, I could not imagine anything worse, but I was wrong as I found out with the extenders on the Honeywell unit which I will go into in the next paragraph. This Holmes unit has the best placement of the power cord which is in the lower left corner... the location is high enough as not to interfere with the bottom of the window frame. This unit has two speeds, high and low. The controls are easy to operate. In fact, there is only one button and two switches. The button cycles through the high and low manual speed settings and then though the automatic temperature presets which are at 60, 65, 70, 75 & 80 degrees fahrenheit. If you set it at one of the temperature presets, the unit will turn off once the sensor reaches that temperature. It seemed to work although I did not have the opportunity to see how accurate that function is. The two switches set the direction of the fans to either intake or exhaust which can be done on each fan independently, so you could have one fan on intake and the other on exhaust for quickly exchanging room air with fresh air. This unit has 8.5 inch fans and they are relatively quiet at both speeds - naturally high is louder than low, but don't expect silence. I own a Kill-A-Watt P3 energy meter and this unit used 46 watts on low and 63 watts on high. I would have been happy with this unit except that two days into using it, the right fan started working intermittently. Of course, that is unacceptable. Returning. I give this fan 3 out of 5 stars because I feel that if you get a good one you'll be happy with it, but don't expect anything great. FYI: Holmes is a division of Sunbeam. Honeywell HW-628 Enviracaire Twin Window Fan: my rating 2 of 5 stars So with the right fan not working correctly on the Homes, I ordered the Honeywell HW-628. As soon as I saw it, I knew that I was not going to be happy with it. For one thing, the unit has 7 inch fans compared with 8.5 inch on the Holmes. So in order to move as much air, the fans would have to run much faster and the unit will be much louder. Time to install... I previously mentioned that the extenders on the Holmes were poorly designed, but the extenders on this Honeywell were MUCH worse. First of all, this unit has two shorter extenders on both the right and left sides instead of one longer extender like the Holmes has. Second, the four extender locks are, get this, located on the BACK of the unit, the side facing out the window! How are you supposed to set those? It was impossible for me. I ended up jamming the extenders into the window frame in order to keep them extended. Okay, so I finally get the unit in the window and turned it on. I found out immediately that my thoughts about the smaller fans, higher fan speed and noise were true. This thing is LOUD. Super loud. And buzzy. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it is downright unruly. There is no chance you would use this in a bedroom even on low speed. The controls were easy to use although not completely intuitive. There are three speeds available on each fan - low, high and super high. You have to set each fan separately, which I think is stupid. I cannot imagine a scenario where I would want one fan on high and another fan on low, etc. The temperature setting dial is also extremely stupid. There are no temperature markings. According to the manual, you are supposed to keep the unit on until the room reaches a temperature that you like and then turn the dial back until the unit cycles off. Seriously? Each fan has its own direction switch for either intake or exhaust. The power cord is located on the bottom center of the front of the unit and its mounted too low so that it interferes with the bottom of my window frame. Who is designing these things? The one feature it had that I liked was that the grilles were directional and could be rotated to direct air in a 360 degree arc. On the power consumption front, this unit used twice the power as the Holmes! - 97 watts on low, 109 watts on high and 120 watts on super high. My unit was defective in that the switches for the right fan are wired incorrectly such that low is high and high is low, but super high is still super high... odd. Returning. Due to the noise level, I would not recommend this unit. I cannot understand how it has 4 of 5 stars and as of today, 262 reviews. Incomprehensible. Bionaire BW2300 Twin Window Fan with Remote Control: my rating 4 of 5 stars So after the poor experience with the Honeywell (They put their name on that piece of junk? They are a defense contractor!), I purchased the Bionaire BW2300 hoping for better luck. The first thing I noticed was the similarity between this unit and the Holmes. That is because they are both made by the same company. Bionaire, like Holmes, is Sunbeam. It has the same right side extender locks as the Holmes, but after the experience with the unusable rear locks on the Honeywell, I was happy to see them! One unwelcome difference is that the power cord is located on the bottom center of the front like it is on the Honeywell, which itself is not a problem but its also too low like it is on the Honeywell. I mounted the unit in window fairly quickly and turned it on. Its got three speeds, low, medium and high. It uses 8.5 inch fans like the Holmes and it is relatively quiet, although I think it may be ever so slightly louder than the Holmes on high. The controls are all electronic and it has an electronic temperature readout and thermostat. It is very easy to use. Simply choose a fan speed and put the unit into intake, exhaust or one fan on intake and the other on exhaust (air exchange mode). You can use it either in manual mode where there is no temperature control or you can set a temperature for the unit to reach and then turn off (automatic mode). This is easy to do using the simple up and down buttons to the right of the large temperature readout or you can use the remote control. Once you set it, it will remember your settings if you turn it off as long as you don't unplug it. The remote control works well and it allows you to control all of the fan's features and functions remotely: on/off, fan speed, air direction, temperature and to toggle between automatic and manual mode. Finally, there is a button to change the brightness of the temperature readout, although you cannot completely turn it off. The power usage was similar to the Holmes. The Kill-A-Watt read 43 watts on low, 49 watts on medium and 64 watts on high. Unlike the most popular review for this unit, my temperature probe was located in its proper track and it seems to work well. I've been using it for three weeks now without issue and so this is the keeper. 4 of 5 stars for this. Its not perfect, but in my opinion, its the best of the three. Just remember that with any window fan, one of the most important things is setting up a ventilation route. In order for a window fan to be most effective, you have to have a second open window for either: drawing in fresh air if you put the fan in exhaust mode. or exhausting room air if you put the fan in intake mode. If you don't have a second open window for either mode, you'll either create a vacuum or pressure balloon, respectively - and either way, you'll not be moving much air which is what a fan is all about - in addition, you'll possibly be overheating and likely killing the fan's motors. The second open window can be in another room or on another floor or it could be a screen door, but you need an unobstructed, open source of fresh air with the fan on exhaust or an equally open window for air to exhaust through if you put the fan on intake mode. Of course, you could use the fan on exchange mode where one fan pushes air in and the other exhausts, but this is not ideal as my observation is that this mode is not nearly as efficient the other two. Also remember that the outside temperature rules everything. In my experience, in order for a fan to cool a room, the outside temperature needs to be at least ten degrees cooler than the inside temperature, and preferably falling, like it typically does at night. If the outside temperature is about the same as inside or warmer, then you'll not be cooled off by a fan. Humidity counts, too. High humidity = bad. The window fan works well for me in the evenings/nights where the outside air temperature drops 10 or 15 degrees into the low 60s or 50s, but the inside air temperature would stay high, even with all the windows wide open as often happens without any significant wind or breeze. With the fan on and with the windows and doors set up correctly, the upstairs bedrooms stay within five or six degrees of the outside temp for me without having to turn the air conditioning on in the spring and fall. I find intake mode most effective for me. And again, remember that the effectiveness of any window fan will depend a lot on the outside temperature and humidity level. As far as these fans are concerned, I would say either get the Holmes HAWF2043 or the Bionaire BW2300, but stay far away from the Honeywell HW-628. Good luck! UPDATE - June 24th, 2014: I've had the Bionaire BW2300 for just over five years now. It's holding up quite well. I use it all the time and it works as well today after five years of use as it did when it was brand new out of the box - no problems at all. The remote control and the full temperature controls are nice! I'm very happy with it. Its one of the best things I've ever purchased.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "We got this fan a few months ago. I read the reviews and was concerned about the temp gauge not working but for the price I gave it a shot anyway. I asked the sales man about the return rate for the produce and he said that not a one had been returned (I didn't really believe him but went ahead with the purchase anyway). Sure enough I plugged it in and the temp started rising, went up to HI and stayed there. Other than that the fan was great. Quiet, strong, the remote worked good. I went back to the store and saw that the display model was doing the same thing. I couldn't believe that they would design the unit in such a way that the circuits would heat up the thermometer. I figured that some poor kid in the factory had missed a step in the assembly process. Last night I took it apart and found the thermometer wire. It was laying across the circuit board. All I did was move the wire thermometer away from the circuit board and when I put it back together and plugged it in, it worked like it should have in the first place. Took less than 20 minutes to fix it. Bionaire Quality Control really slipped on this one. 5 stars for a good product, minus one for the trouble. If you want to fix it here is how I did it, but if you break yours I accept no responsibility. The instructions state \"Do NOT attempt to repair or adjust any electrical or mechanical functions on this unit. Doing so will void the warranty.\" UN-PLUG THE FAN. Unscrewed all the screws in the back (7 total I think). Then use a flat-head screw driver to open it from the side that doesn't have the built in extender. I couldn't figure out how to open it all the way but was able to open it about 35 degrees, like a clam, and remove the plastic cover that shields the circuits. The thermometer is the white plastic wire that is only attached to the circuit board on one end, not the round metal thing with a hole in the middle, that is the speaker. I stretched the thermometer wire out to the side, away from the circuit board and the put it back together.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I live in Orange County, California, near the beach, so the air is generally cool outside. The sun warms the inside of the house, so the trick is getting the cool air into the warm house. This fan is great for that. NOISE: There are three speeds. Low and medium are fairly quiet. High is louder. AIRFLOW DIRECTION: There are three options- BOTH IN, BOTH OUT or EXCHANGE (one fan in, one fan out). The only mode that really cools the room is BOTH IN, but it works well (it works even better if you open the bedroom door so there is no resistance to airflow). SETUP: installation was easy, but note that I have a narrow window that slides up and down. Apparently, it fits \"double-hung, vertical slider, and casement windows 24 to 37 inches wide.\" For windows that slide sideways, the manual indicates to set the fan vertically in the window opening, with the left side down (ostensibly because the fins on the left are fixed/hard, while the fins on the right are retractable/accordion type). I recommend this product. The only caveat is that I have only had it for a few days, so I have no idea if it will be durable. The five year warranty gives some comfort. SEPTEMBER 24, 2012 UPDATE: it's been eight years (i.e., three years past the warranty expiration) and it still works fine. So, thumbs up for durability as well. One caveat- it does pull a lot of dust, etc., in from the outside. I wedged a 14x24x1 air filter in front of it, which does affect airflow, but does wonders in reducing the amount of dust, etc., pulled-in. I would recommend the fiberglass strand type filters over the pleated fabric type filters.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "This fan is of great value. It will quietly refresh your room during a warm summer night, allowing you to sleep and benefit from air circulation in those houses where there is no central air conditionning. It has 3 speeds and 3 air flow settings (In, Out, Exchange: one fan works in and the other out to exchange the room's air with the outside air) to rapidly get the room to the desired confort level. It also has an Automatic mode that controls the fan's operation until the desired temperature is reached. This feature is not ideal since it will have the fan starting and stopping every 2-3 minutes when the temperature rises back to above the desired temperature. Altogether, I am very satisfied with this fan, even though I do not use the Automatic feature. It is exceptionnaly quiet I find and the air flow features get the job done in no time.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I, like several others who have purchased this fan experienced the same problem with the thermostat. From the moment I turned it on the temperature indicator continued to rise (instead of decline) even though it was 65° outside and 75° inside. Having read the reviews prior to making the purchase, I made the mistake of assuming that the poor design and assembly would have been corrected since almost three years had passed since \"Wayne-in-Seattle\" first posted his problem with the thermostat back on August 30, 2004.Bionaire can rest assured that this will be the LAST of their products I will ever purchase! Correcting the problem is fairly simple; all you need to do is reposition the temperature sensing wire inside the control panel so the heat generated inside does not influence the temperature sensor. The only tool you will need will be a small Phillips had screwdriver. Remove the seven screws on the back of the unit. You will not be able to completely remove the back panel unless you can figure out how to do so without breaking the accordion expansion panel on the right side of the unit. You will however be able to separate the back from the front enough to remove the control panel cover inside(no screws involved). Once inside you will see two white wires that are connected to the circuit board. One of those wires is approximately 3 inches long and is only connected to the board on one end; the other end hangs freely; this is the temperature sensing wire. The last inch of this wire has also been stripped of its coating and taped. Carefully reposition the the wire toward the top of the unit, pulling it taut so that no part of it touches the circuit board, taping it if necessary (approximately 1.25 inches will stick out when you're done). Replace the control panel cover, screw the unit back together and you are DONE! The next time you turn it on the temperature indicator will be displaying a more realistic value.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I have one of these, bought 2 years ago: it works beautifully. I bought another this week, and the thermostat feature was completely unusable. I tried 2 more (all were from the same store, this year and 2 years ago); all of the new ones would show the correct temperature when first plugged in, and then the temperature shown would rise, generally to about 15 degrees above the ambient temperature. The control unit on the new ones seems to generate heat, and in fact one time it felt warmer than the rest of the unit; this is true with the fan off and only the thermometer functioning. The same problem is seen with the fans on--the temperature reads erroneously high. This makes the thermostat feature, which ranges up no higher than 80 degress F, useless. This is because the fan thinks it's 80 when in fact it's 65. The fan functions very well as a simple remote-control fan: strong, quiet, flexible. But since I bought it for the thermostat feature, which no longer works in the three current examples I've tested, I give it a poor rating.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "~Edited 1/2012 My fans still run like new. Taking them apart to clean is a nuisance, but I don't mind due to their durability.~ My living room (approx 12'x16' and open to the kitchen) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day. It sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it. The Bionaire BW2300 cools it in half the time it used to take. ~Edit: My statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time I once did is inaccurate. If the outside temp is lower than inside, the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours.~ It also does a great job circulating air when its hot out (and in) to keep the room from feeling stuffy. I have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have. The temp gauge on mine works well. ~Edit: The thermometer reads the temp of fan's exact location, not the room's temperature. For example, in the afternoon sun, mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature. When it is colder outside at night, it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp. ~ Is it really quiet? Yes! I have a Vornado fan, which is quite quiet for a fan. This is even quieter (although not silent). To accommodate different window sizes, this model comes with a built-in extender, and two add-on extenders. The fan with extenders isn't large enough to fit my 38.5\" window width. I could order another add-on extender from the manufacturer, but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead. What comes in the box? The fan, two extenders, two AAA batteries and the remote. ~Edited 7/28/06: I bought a second one for my bedroom. Its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees. The slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model. So I cannot direct the air onto (or away from) a particular area of the room.~", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I've been running this fan for a week. This is the only window fan I found that came with a remote control. It compares pretty well with all the other Holmes and Honeywell competitors with adjustable speeds, the ability to adjust fan direction electronically, and an adjustable thermostat. But the main selling point is the ability to do all of this while sitting at my desk or lying on the bed. One little gripe is that the on/off button on the remote control sticks a little and sometimes skips a few settings as a result of it, but I got the hang of making it not stick when I press it. The noise level is quite acceptable to me especially at the lowest setting. It blows very smoothly. My previous cheap window fan spun like an F-15 engine at the lowest setting, and I had to turn it around to change the fan direction, so this new fan is a godsend. I hope it holds up during the blistering hot summer days. One other thing - it also makes an excellent air freshner when you set the fan to blow the air out or on air exchange mode. I'll be selling my Honeywell air filter.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "The other reviewers who talked about the thermostat problems are exactly right. I'm returning my fan to Amazon because of this very problem. Just plug in the fan, and watch as the temperature reading climbs in a manner of minutes to 99 degrees! (It then reads \"Hi\" because it can't display more than 2 digits. In other words, the fan thinks it's over 100 degrees in your home! I live in the Northeast, so that's not the case.) Now, if you're only going to manually operate this fan, then that's probably not going to be a major issue for you. But I bought this fan because I live in an upstairs apartment, and I wanted my place aired out and cooled off a bit during the day while I'm at work. But I also didn't want to leave the fan running all day long, and this model has a feature that only turns on the fan when the temperature exceeds the setting you enter. That would be a great feature to have... if only it worked! Because the temperature reading maxes out, the fan never shuts itself off! If you're not going to be home a lot like me and don't want this fan running constantly, look for another model. On the plus side, the remote can control whether the fan is used for intake or exhaust, so if it's in an inconvenient place (like a very high window), you can basically control every function of the fan remotely without ever touching it after installation. Pretty cool (no pun intended). If it weren't for the faulty thermostat placement this would be a great fan, but unfortunately that's a major design flaw in my book that crippled the one feaure I wanted. Back to the drawing board, Bionaire!", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "The fan does its job. Before we got it we did a lot of research, and it was hands down the best choice for the money. All the functions work pretty nicely EXCEPT the digital thermostat, but not to worry - half of us don't even set it up. For the other half you can do the same thing as I did, like I said we read the reviews on it and every one said that the thermostat is the main draw back but some one actually took it apart and supplied the detailed instructions how to move the thermo wire away from the board, I did it in 20 min., so if you are a handy man then there is nothing to it. Overall we are happy with this fan.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "Great price, and this fan does what you want it to do. Nice feature is the height is ADJUSTABLE up to about 42\" high at the top. It has 3 fan speeds, and the oscillation is easily stoppable at any of the 3. The blades and grill are plastic, not metal, which may make it less durable, BUT also makes it somewhat quieter. Moves a good amount of air, I usually keep it at the lowest speed from a few feet away and am quite comfortable thusly. The only thing I would change if I could is the speed selector should be separate from an on switch, because it goes from OFF to highest to medium to lowest, so i have to click through all the speeds to turn it on and off each time. It would be nice if the speed control knob were separate from the on/off control, and the speed were essentially dimmable from nothing to max , not just 3 preset positions of low, med, and high. This fan is an excellent choice for bedside though, because you have the option of lowering the height of the pole. The more expensive honeywell with remote control lacks the height adjustment feature.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I bought this fan in July 2009 at Target, on sale for $22.50 and it's GREAT! I live in Brooklyn, so lugging the box up and down subways and stairs makes the plastic lightweight construction a BIG plus! Putting it together was a Breeze! 10 min with NO TOOL! (Big selling point) The flat-black color is very nice, just don't trip over it at night. It moves a lot of air, is adjustable to 45\", has 3 speeds (0=off, 1, 2, and 3) and oscillates which you can of course turn switch off. Some might not care for the fact that there is no separate off switch, it's setting zero on the fan speed control, but I didn't mind that at all. I must say that although the plug claims to have some sort of \"patented\" surge protection in the plug (who really cares, right?), the cord itself is VERY short. I didn't measure it but it seems comparatively short and was not long enough to stretch across from one outlet to where I needed it. (So get your extension cord out.. which then diminishes the \"patented\" surge protection on the plug!) Overall it is money well spent, it's not very loud for sleeping, not too heavy, and at $22.50 was a good price. please note, this model does Not have a remote or timer! I would buy it again and would recommend it to a friend.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I've had this fan since 2009, ordered off of Amazon. I don't have any major complaints. The lowest setting is usually good enough for me, and it's fairly quiet. I often run it at night while I'm sleeping. The base seems secure- my fan has never tipped or fallen over. I have two small-ish issues: 1) Always use two hands to adjust the fan height. Use one hand to hold up the fan head while you use the other hand to loosen the tension on the fan's neck. I once lazily decided to loosen the tension without holding up the fan, and it came crashing down on my hand as soon as the tension was light enough. It didn't break the skin or anything, but it was painful. 2) The plastic seems cheap and sort of \"bendy\" and pliable, but my fan's lasted about two years so far, so I guess it doesn't affect longevity too much.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "What I couldn't tell from the pictures, and I didn't see mentioned in any of the reviews I read (I didn't read all of them, maybe 10 or so) is the entire fan cage/grill is PLASTIC that snaps together.

Quick shipping by Amazon, and an affordable price, but if had known it was all PLASTIC and not a metal wire cage I would NOT have bought this. Honestly the only reason I bought it from Amazon is all the local stores ran out of stand fans. If I had seen this in a store I would have kept walking. Only time will tell if my wife decides this thing is too cheap & tacky looking to stay in the living room. I suspect it will get migrated to a guest bedroom and I will be buying a better fan in the near future.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I bought one of these fans locally and I liked it so much that I ordered another one from Amazon. Here are the pros and cons as I see them. Pros: 1. It pushes a lot of air - I can get a nice breeze from as far as 25 feet away. 2. It doesnt take up a lot of room. 3. It is not ugly like many fans are. 4. The remote control with flashlight is a nice feature even though I rarely use it. For the person who complained about one LED being burned out straight out of the box. Only one LED is for the flashlight. The other is for the remote control functions and doesnt illuminate. Cons 1. The breeze feature is kind of annoying because of the fluctuation of the noise level. 2. You have to hold the remote in a specific postition to make it work. If the fan is oscillating, its hard to find that position.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I have central AC, but my home office is typically a few degrees warmer than the rest of the house. I decided to add a fan to help cool the area off, but I wanted the quietest fan that did the job. I ended up ordering the following three fans through Amazon for comparison: - Lasko 4924 Space-Saving High-Velocity 3-Speed Oscillating Blower Fan (HVB) - Honeywell Digital Tower Fan with Remote and Ionizer - Lasko 42 In. Wind Curve Tower Fan I'll start with the quick summary for the TL;DR crowd. In terms of air flow, from highest to lowest, the ranking is: HVB >> Wind Curve > Honeywell. In terms of noise, from loudest to quietest: HVB > Honeywell > Wind Curve. Thus, the fan with the best air flow for the noise generated, and the one I picked, was the Lasko Wind Curve. And now for the details, for those that don't suffer from ADD. Wall of text inc. Power Usage I was able to measure power usage for each fan using a Kill-A-Watt meter. All 3 fans had 3 output settings (low/med/high), and I measured their power usage to be: HVB - 95/103/111 watts Honeywell - 32/36/40 watts Wind Curve - 37/41/47 watts Noise I used an SPL meter app on my iPhone to measure how loud each fan was at each of those settings. All of the fans were tested in the same spot and the iPhone was placed on a stand about 5 ft away, in front and slightly to the side of each fan, so that wind noise didn't factor into the measurements: HVB - 59/61/64 db Honeywell - 50/53/55 db Wind Curve - 46/49/51 db Air Flow I don't have a way to measure each fan's output objectively, so these are my impressions: HVB - Lasko wasn't kidding when they labeled the 4924 with the acronym HVB for High Velocity Blower. When I first got it and ran it on *low*, I was thinking that this would be really good air flow for a quality fan on its *high* setting. It's by far the highest output fan here. They also described it as having a quiet motor; while this might be true, it's still the loudest of the bunch. Having the smallest vent opening of the bunch might have contributed to the noise level. Another user review I read of this fan said it feels like AC with this fan running, and that's true. If you're partially deaf, or plan on placing the fan 20 ft or more away from you, this is a good choice. Honeywell and Wind Curve - The output of these two fans are more comparable. I still feel the Wind Curve puts out a little more air flow than the Honeywell at the equivalent setting though. For some reason, even the Wind Curve feels like AC is running, if only on low. There's an uncanny cooling effect the Lasko fans have that the Honeywell doesn't. Maybe it's just better airflow at a lower noise level. If you look at the measurements above, the Wind Curve on high is only slightly louder than the Honeywell on low. I mostly ran these fans on low--as I was looking for the quietest solution--and at times, I still felt warm with the Honeywell, but the Wind Curve delivers. The Honeywell does have a filter on the back intake side, which probably hurts its air flow a bit. You can hear a *very* slight ticking sound from the Wind Curve at times, sort of like fast crickets. I haven't found it annoying and it doesn't sound like something's wearing out. It's probably only noticeable because of its low noise level. Size / Weight / Appearance Exact dimensions and weight can be found on their Amazon product pages, so I won't provide specific numbers. All of them were delivered in their product boxes, which were all somewhat beatened up from being delivered by UPS. The HVB is the shortest, but also the heaviest. Both the Honeywell and the Wind Curve are noticeably lighter than the HVB. It's shipped as a single piece and there's nothing to assemble. You take it out of the box and it's ready to go. It has a low center of gravity and stands up stably. All tower fans should be designed this way. It has horizontal flaps that can be adjusted to direct airflow up. The flaps are really small, but they seem to work decently. The Honeywell is about a foot taller than the HVB. It's shipped in 5 pcs that have to be assembled--the main body, 2 pieces that join together to form the circular base, and another 2 pcs that join together to form an \"optional\" pedestal that sits between the base and the body. I wouldn't really call the pedestal optional, as without it the vent opening starts about 5-6\" off the ground and there are no flaps to adjust the airflow up. I found assembling the unit difficult to do by myself. It's just not easy holding these pieces so they line up while you screw them together. In fact, little plastic fragments broke off while I was assembling it. I assume they were all internal and non-essential, as the product looks fine once assembled. The manual cautions that using the pedestal makes the unit less stable, and that is true. It's the wobbliest of the bunch, but it won't tip over easily. A sturdier base and pedestal would have made this a lot less wobbly. The black plastic in the product pictures looks really nice and shiny, but not as good in person. The Wind Curve is a few inches taller than the Honeywell, making it the tallest of the bunch. It's shipped in 3 pcs--the main body and 2 pcs that join together to form its circular base. Assembling this unit still wasn't easy to do solo, but it was easier than dealing with the Honeywell and its body-pedestal-base. The base on this feels a little sturdier than the Honeywell's, and the assembled unit is less wobbly, though still not perfect. There are some horizontal flaps to direct the airflow up, but these only cover the top third of the vent. None of the online pictures I've seen for this fan do it any justice. The wood accent makes the unit look really nice in person. Controls The HVB only has physical controls. There's a knob that controls the fan speed, from left to right: low-mid-high-off. There's a separate push button that turns the oscillation on/off. There's no remote, no timer, and no ionization function. The Honeywell has digital controls and comes with a remote. There's an LCD window that shows the air temperature, fan speed, and timer. It has one nice ability that neither of the Laskos have, and that's the ability to turn on/off at a preset temperature, just like the HVAC system in a home. Although the controls are all digital, half of the six buttons have shared functions. There's a single button that controls the fan speed and turning the unit on/off and it cycles from: high-med-low-off. So if you want to turn the fan on and run it on low, that's 3 clicks. There's also a single button that controls oscillation and ionization, and it cycles between: oscillate only-oscillate & ionize-ionize only-neither. The third shared function button controls how the unit turns off, either by timer or temperature. The timer can be set in 1 hr increments, from 1-12 hrs I believe. Two buttons are labeled up/down, which can only be used for setting the timer or temperature. The last button is for a \"breeze\" feature that is unique to this fan, which essentially just varies the fan speed. There's two breeze modes, one varies the speed between the current speed and the next setting below it (high-med, med-low, low-off), and the other just varies the speed between high-med-low. I found the noise level changes from this feature to be too distracting. The remote has five of the six buttons that the unit has, lacking the button to enable the timer/temp mode. Oddly, up/down arrows exist on the remote, but are only useful if you're already in the timer/temp mode. However, if you're using the remote, chances are you can't read the display to see what the timer/temp setting is anyways. The other side of the remote has a button which controls an LED flashlight. The Wind Curve also has digital controls and comes with a remote. There are a total of 8 leds displaying the status of the fan, from left to right: 4 red leds indicate that the timer is enabled and how much time is left--representing 30 mins, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hr (you add them up to get the total); 3 green leds indicating the fan speed--low, med, high; and 1 blue led indicating whether ionization is on/off. There's 5 buttons controlling the fan, the same on the unit as on the remote--power, oscillate, timer (adds 30 mins to the timer with every click), ionization, and fan speed (cycles between high-med-low). I like that there's a separate control to turn the fan on/off and the fan speed is remembered. The timer setting is a little primitive compared to the Honeywell's though, as it does take 15 clicks if you want the full duration of 7.5 hrs. All of the controls are confirmed with a beep. I think I read a review where someone complained it was too loud, but I found it really faint, even compared to the fan on low. The click of the button on the remote is louder. Although, the confirmation beep for turning the fan off is a little long--lasting about a second--and that could be shorter. Oscillation All of the fans have this feature and were quiet enough that I can't hear the difference whether on or off. The Laskos oscillation range appeared to be a little under 90 degrees. When placed in a corner, I don't think anyone would complain about the coverage. The honeywell's oscillation range was a little wider, but it oscillates in one direction a little faster than the other. Sort of like how some sprinklers operate, but the difference in speeds isn't as drastic. Ionization The HVB lacked this feature, but I consider it a gimmick anyways. From what I've read, ionized air doesn't freshen up the air, it just impairs your sense of smell. Ionizing air cleaners also operate by charging the air and dust with one charge, and having an oppositely charged plate or filter in front of the air flow to catch the charged dust. Neither of the fans with ionization features have this plate/filter.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I'm a hot sleeper, and I've tried many things to help cool things down so I can sleep. This fan has turned out to be the BEST thing I've used by far. I discovered this fan at a doctor's office and then again at a sleep center. After experiencing it at both locations, I decided to buy one for myself. I've had my fan for almost a year and could not imagine being without it now. The fan performs all the normal features you'd expect of an oscillating room fan as already mentioned by many others so I'm not going to review those features. Instead, I'm going review one feature that is often overlooked: the temperature control. The temperature control is the feature that puts this fan above all others. It literally behaves like an air conditioner! After turning the fan on, setting the temperature control is very easy. You just press the mode button one time and use the up/down arrow buttons to set a specific temperature (2 degree increments). That's all there is to it. Once set, the fan will run until the room has cooled down to the set temperature, and then it will shut off automatically. When the room temperature raises above the set temperature, the fan will turn itself back on automatically to cool the room back down. This behavior is that of an air conditioner! The temperature control offers incredible flexibility. I can cool down just my bedroom while leaving the rest of the house at normal temperature so I don't freeze out my children. I can also cool down my bedroom only at night for sleeping while leaving the room at normal temperature during the day. Plus, because the air coming out of the fan is colder than the room temperature, the feeling of being cooled is instantaneous. So not only does this fan offer all the benefits of an oscillating tower fan, but the temperature mode makes the air colder than room temperature, turning the fan into an oscillating tower air conditioner. The combination makes this particular fan the best one I have ever used. --------- UPDATE: I ran across my old review and thought I would update it. I bought two of these fans on June 29, 2011. It is now March 9, 2013 and both fans are still working perfectly! I haven't even had to replace the batteries on the remote controls yet even though I use one quite a bit (I never expected to use the flashlight feature so much, but I use it very often). I am still very pleased with my fans. I use one every single day, almost all day long; although, it can be too cold at times so I turn it off if I get chilled. I am contemplating buying a couple more fans just to keep on hand since I know these fans won't last forever, and I can't imagine doing without one now. I've bought many different fans over the years and nothing has come close to cooling me down as well as this particular model. This was definitely one of the best buys I've made! --------- UPDATE 2: It is now April of 2014, and both of my fans are still working perfectly even after 3 years of daily use! I cannot be more pleased with the performance of these fans!", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I am not entirely sure if this is what I have but it looks identical. (My Model #: HY-047B) From my experience of using several tower fans, this Honeywell product is excellent. It pushes a lot of air quietly and oscillates in a wider angle compared to the tower fan from Lasko. Its look is decent but if you prefer a fancier fan, I would recommend Lasko 42\" Wind Curve though it doesn't circulate as much air. (I have recently bought this Lasko fan and returned it because it is not powerful enough; its third level of wind speed is only equivalent to the first level of this Honeywell fan.) In addition, I like that this fan comes with a filter that can be easily washed and reinstalled. I would consider this a four-season fan because its three levels of wind speed fits my needs all year round unlike the Lasko 42\" Wind curve, which I would consider it as a winter fan, and Nexus Tropical Breeze, which I would call it a summer fan because it pushes unbelievable amount of air to great distances.

Easy to clean, just remove the filter in the back and either vaccuum or wash once a month. I don't use the ionizer very often, usually when I need to get rid of stale odors or burning food smells and smoke from neighbors.

{"review": "The Honeywell 3-Speed Digital Tower Fan with Ionizer uses up a very small amount of real estate because of it's sleek tower design. The features included with the fan are great. While the price is not easy to swallow, the performance makes it seem justified. Definitely check this out. Pros: + Takes up a small amount of floor space + It has surprising air-power, especially on high + It has an attractive look with the black body and chrome accents + The included ionizer, oscillation and breeze settings give you a lot of options + The remote control has a convenient light for night use and all the controls to power and adjust your fan + Remote also has a cool resting place on top of the fan Cons: - The base isn't as firm as it could be, and the fan will sway if you push it; move it seldom and carefully - The noise is noticeable when the fan is on high - Remote has a limited range - Some functions require multiple clicks with the remote (no big deal) - I can't help but be nervous when I read about bad tech support or short lived products; mine is still going strong Last year I bought and had a terrible experience with the Holmes HASF-99 10-Inch Velocity Blizzard Stand Fan, which is no longer sold by Amazon and now only seems to be sold by third party merchants. After every supporting piece on that fan broke away from minimal use, I thought I would move up to a better brand at any cost. That's the only reason I would spend $60 or $70 for a fan. So far it's been worth it. It is just a fan, but the ionizer is a nice feature even if I'm not totally sold yet that it does much. The remote is very handy, and the looks can't be beat. Best of all, this fan has kept working and creates an awesome air flow. While the height is not adjustable, the tower design only takes up a small floor area. This fan is light and easy to move around too, unlike the Holmes fan. These days there are more options in fans available. If you are looking for a circulation fan as opposed to a tower model, there are other options. I haven't tried all of those, but just do your research with a grain of salt for the info that's out there. Versa-Kool 12 Inch Circulation Fan 12 Volt Hunter 90021 Century 12-Inch Performance Oscillating Fan Honeywell HFS641P 16-Inch Remote Control Stand Fan I was lucky enough to get a small discount for this item on sale, but now that summer is in full swing don't expect to pay much less than these prevailing prices.

{"review": "Geez, half the reviews here complain this fan is too quiet, while the other half say it's not quiet enough. Didn't know who to believe, so I just took the plunge and ordered the bastard. My verdict? Not dead silent, but on the lowest of 3 speeds it's quiet enough to make me happy, and appreciably quieter than my former fan, a raucously loud Holmes Lil Blizzard. Some of the improvement is probably due to this fan having an 8\" diameter blade instead of 6\" (bigger blade = lower frequency noise), but still. Sound aside, this Honeywell HT-908 is physically stable, can tilt 90 degrees (straight up), and lives up to its self-description as a Whole Room Air Circulator (didn't realize \"fan\" needed marketing euphemisms) by doing a bang-up job of moving air across a bedroom even on its lowest setting. Overall, a pretty phat fan. If anyone cares, it's not a real Honeywell product, but made by some Massachusetts company called Kaz.

Opening a window and using a small portable fan does not cut it. I wasn't sure what I was looking for. Having never thought about the concept of an air circulator, when I read the description I knew I had to get it. It sounded perfect. And I'm very glad purchased it. My entire room is cool, my window is closed, I don't need to carry it around with me, and it is quiet. Now when people say they don't want to live above the second floor because of the heat, I'll show them this, and they might change their mind.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I'm very pleased with the 908. I was looking for another HT 800 but found out that it was discontinued. This one is bigger and quite effective. Had it about a month now and only used it a the lowest setting, so far. We've had some 100+ degree weather recently and this one has come through like a champ. It's pretty quiet. Some folks seem more concerned about using fans as 'white noise' generators, but as a cooling device this one works! I notice that the price has gone up, so I'm glad I got it when I did. [update, because I'm only allowed one review] Fast forward to May 2012. I bought a second fan from another online store. I noticed two things, the new version now has a fuse in the plug and, maybe more importantly, the fan speed is slower than the original 2010 version (judging from the lowest setting). Looking more closely at the underside of the bottom of the fan, it appears that while both are still Made in China, the actual manufacturer might have changed. So, I'm hoping the quality and construction hasn't changed, especially after reading the other recent reviews saying it didn't last them. My old 2010 edition is still going strong and I've just unboxed for its 3rd summer season. With the older one I never considered the other two higher settings. Now with the newer one, the slow setting is fine but might need to notch it up on occasion. Will monitor through summer and update here if necessary. [Oct 2013 update] I just wanted to note that my 2012 edition fan broke last month. The fan still works but the rotating/tilt ratchet (both sides) broke. The round plastic piece just shattered for no apparent reason. Now, I have to prop the face of the fan to keep it facing forward, else it will point straight to the ceiling.:D Kind of disturbing since I don't think that I excessively used the tilt mechanism.

I can't recommend it to anyone with pet hair, lint or dust issues.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I've been using these for years and have gone through about a half-dozen. I used to love them. Unfortunately their quality has been consistently declining. The new ones that say \"25% Quieter\" are definitely quieter; but the reason they're quieter is because they put a really underpowered motor in them. Now, the high setting is about as powerful as the low setting used to be. And the low setting is essentially useless. I would not recommend these fans anymore.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "I got this fan to try to move some air in my stuffy room. This fan does a great job of doing that, even on the 'low' setting. I bounce the air flow off my ceiling and can am able to feel it on the other side of the room (which I thought was great). I bought this model because the box said 25% quieter than comparable models, but it has failed to live up to its claim (unless the others are even nosier than this one). Probably 50-60 db noise level (I was hoping for about 30 db). Notes about what is included: Black fan with cord (head rotates 90 deg) Three speeds (High, medium, and low) - I usually only use low (it gets too loud) Fan cover has six screws holding it on (sort of awkward to take off). I would think it would last a while, but I've only had mine for two months. Overall, its okay. It moves a lot of air, but is not at quiet as I had hoped.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "After reading some of the 1 and 2 star reviews I wasn't so sure but I got this fan anyway, and am very glad I did so. It's a little larger than the space I originally had for it (it was replacing another, smaller fan that went belly-up), but I found a different place and it fits just fine. On the lowest setting it's still powerful enough to move the air in a large area. It's also pretty quiet, for a powerful fan. The only issue I have with it is that the control knob is on top and sort of recessed, behind the fan, so it's awkward to manipulate from in front of the fan.", "id": "3737601"}

{"review": "I was debating between this fan and the Vornado 530 for my bedroom and I ended up choosing this one because it's cheaper (at least here on Amazon, although not everywhere) and the head pivots (which the Vornado 530 doesn't do). I'm glad I chose this one. Used as a directional fan (i.e. aimed right at me), this is hard to beat. Even on the lowest setting I can feel significant breeze from across my room (which is not huge, but I used to share with 2 brothers, so it's sizable) and it's quiet enough for me to sleep comfortably on the middle setting as well. On the highest setting it's kinda noisy, but also powerful. As an air circulator (i.e. aimed into the room at large but not at me directly) when the temperature is not that hot it makes the room noticeably more comfortable even on the lowest setting. You have to fiddle with aiming it properly to get good airflow depending on where it's situated in the room and how the furniture is arranged, but I can usually find a good spot, and after a few minutes I can feel the air moving. I also got it partly as a heat circulator in the winter, since I sleep on the top of a bunk bed (two brothers, remember?) and often the temperature is uneven (really hot and dry on top near the ceiling, cold near the floor). I haven't had a chance to try it yet (I just got it this summer), but I think it will work. This fan is also fairly small and light, making it easy to move from room to room and set up on a stool or table or just on the floor. A nice touch is that the plug includes a protective fuse (replaceable, of course), which I've never seen anywhere else. Something that could use some improvement: the fan doesn't pivot downward, only from straight forward to 90 degrees upward, so it wouldn't be very effective on top of a closet or high shelf (for example) and the cord is kind of short, although that's an issue for many appliances (it's six feet, I think, which seems to be standard, although it can be hard to find a nice spot for it within six feet of an outlet). That can obviously be remedied with an extension cord. I've only had this fan for about a week, and so far it's been great, I would recommend it to anyone else and I might even get another.", "id": "3737601"}
{"review": "We are about to buy our THIRD Honeywell HT-908, which will replace our second one that just conked out. So why did I say they are durable? Because they are. We are heavy fan users. These fans last us about seven years each, but they run eight hours a day, 365 days a year, every night when we sleep. Think about it - this fan for us gives about 24,000 hours of comfort over it's lifetime and we are heavy users of this appliance. In fan terms, this thing takes a pounding and keeps working. Even you furnace blower motor can't take this amount of use without maintenance (oiling, cleaning, etc.). The average water heater for a house comes with a seven year guarentee. They are great for moving air, and their noise level on high isn't bad. The air isn't choppy. And for its price, it's a good deal. My only complaint is cleaning this fan is a bear of a job because the grille fins are so small. To clean the fan blades, you have to remove a small dozen Phillips head screws. Look, The only thing that lasts forever is carbon. Love doesn't last forever; we'd like to think it does, but it doesn't. I used to love cream cheese and jelly sandwiches on white bread when I was kid; now the idea of them makes me queasy. Even the sun won't be around forever.

Can be fixed by applying a small piece of black electrical tape over the light...ahhh. Great fan overall, worth the extra cash. FYI - Honeywell has a bad design of a wide base with a skinny stand and heavy tower on top. After about a year of use, the Honeywell fan started squeaking when we had it on occillation and broke from the base due to the torque on the stand. Don't buy a tower fan with a skinny stand if you want it to last! Exceptional bonus: I ordered this fan at 4:30 Pm on Day 1 and it was at my front door at noon on Day 2!!!

After having tried multiple different floor fans that did absolutely nothing I decided to try this fan. This fan is a godsend for me because it makes my apartment bearable most of the time. I lean it against my window and it circulates the hot air out instead of just around the room like regular fans. On some occasions it almost feels as if I had ac.

{"review": "UPDATE 2014-05-03 on A BETTER WAY TO CLEAN DUST FROM THE FAN I used to take the fan down to hose the dust down when I see dust accumulating. But getting the idea from another reviewer, I bought a yard of tulle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IBGPW2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_30) and sewed a tube (by hand) with cutout for the cord to come through. Then I slide the window fan inside so the tulle wraps completely around the whole fan. As time goes on, I see 2 circles of dust showing up on the tulle. As the dust circles get thicker, I simply use a vacuum attachment to vacuum the dust off the tulle. Simple, easy and quick. No more taking down the fan. ORIGINAL VIDEO REVIEW The video demonstrates real life usage and you can see the fan in action. Hope this will help you in choosing a window fan that works for you. I've had an old Holmes window fan that I needed replacing. The key is the height of the window. Mine is in the bathroom and 22\" high. This window fan is 21.5\" (and not 22.7\" as mentioned in the website). I have used the old one for 17.5 years to be exact and have been looking for a replacement for couple years on amazon.com and not until recently that I found this Holmes model. Majority of the window fans are 25\" wide or more. As a side note for reversible airflow needs. I also have another Holmes window fan that has dual blades, 3 speed settings and reversible airflow settings for In, Out and Exchange. It is wider and fits my other bigger window. In my search, I have read reviews of the Lesko fan of the same/similar dimensions about which the reviews say the fan is made of cheap plastic and will bend when pressed. Not this one. I highly recommend this Holmes fan. The Lesko fan was around $33 at Lasko Twin Window Fan, 2137 and I bought this Holmes fan for around $23 on Oct 16, 2013.", "id": "3737601"}

There are no knobs or anything like that to tighten and make it stay at the angle you want. Luckily that's not really an issue for me, but it is kind of annoying, and I could see it being an issue for other people.

Don't buy it if you're expecting something quiet though because even on the lowest setting it lets you know it's working hard to keep you coooool. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is for the hex nuts holding the fan to the frame, that means if it ever runs loose, you have to dig into your tool-box for a 1/2\" spanner (wrench) to adjust it, tightening knobs would have been much better.

{"review": "I first checked with Consumer Reports to get an idea of which chest freezer brands passed the marks on: - energy efficiency and - consistency throughout the freezer for temperature / temperature control / temperature performance Danby stood out in a class of it's own and I was shocked at how many didn't do as well. PRO's ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Delivery was on time and they even brought it up the stairs and into my apartment! (no curb-side nonsense!) It was a breeze to unpack and there were no dents or dings. It was in excellent condition. The basket and side compartment are convenient. The chest is rather deep. There are two wheels on the back and two rubbers on the front for ease of movement and stability. A drain hole in the bottom A light indicator on the right front bottom corner so you know if the power is on or off Temperature control knob is easy to use, but simplistic (no degree's stated) No internal light, but that isn't a problem for me. If you need more dividers, you can use just about anything or visit home depot and buy some. **I would have preferred the power-on light and the temperature control knob on the upper right corner, but I understand that they are placed on the bottom corner b/c that is where the motor is.** DEDUCTED A STAR ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So.. why did I deduct a star? *sigh* It's hard to say this because I do like the freezer very much, but honesty is important. After unplugging the freezer and letting it return to room temperature, I noticed a strong / pungent \"chemical\" odor in the freezer. I was quite alarmed. I broke out the Dawn dish soap and a sponge and began cleaning. Not fun. The textured surface makes it difficult to clean. You must essentially use a bucket of water and splash it down to rinse it clean. Good thing for that drain hole in the bottom! After cleaning it.. twice.. there was only the slightest hint of odor remaining. I left the freezer top open and checked after two days and the odor was almost non-existent by then. After a week, there is no odor at all. I will point out that when it was running and at zero degrees, there was absolutely NO odor to be detected at all and so I do not understand why there was one at room temperature. Either way, a thorough cleaning with dish soap is all that is needed and then let it sit wide open (unplugged) for 3 to 5 days and the odor will be completely gone. SUMMARY --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Do not let the odor issue detract you from purchasing the freezer. It's a fantastic freezer. It runs quietly, maintains constant temperature, extremely energy efficient, and passed Consumer Reports testing with flying colors. In fact, only the Amana chest freezer came close to it's performance but was much more expensive. I will be getting my 1/2 a cow in two months and will update at some point afterwards to complete this review.", "id": "3741331"}
{"review": "I looked around for a medium sized freezer and the price was at least 50 bucks less than I could find locally. We have been replacing less efficient items in our home. I was very pleased that the yearly cost is only 29.00/yr on the energy guide. Since our electrical cost is just above a nickle rather than $10.65 national average, a dollar a month sounds thrifty to me. This is the second Danby appliance we own. The other is a dishwasher and 4 years old. Like the freezer it is ultra efficient. Both do match the lines and curves (of the Designer Series) if they happen to be in the same space. Ours are not, but might be important for some. One thing I was impressed with was the packaging. The foam on the sides was curved (fitted) to prevent shipping damage. The outside box had seen some use. The freezer was in absolutely perfect condition. I did carefully inspect it! Living down the road from the geographical center of North America, the freezer put on a few miles ;~) and was shipped vertical on our UPS truck! If you are considering a freezer, a chest style is the way to go for energy savings. On an upright, the cold flows out every time you open the door. Not so with a chest style. Cold does not go uphill. Hot moist air does not flow downhill so frost formation is very minimal. No need for \"frost-free\". Just defrost once a year. That's about the time to find all that stuff that has been there too long anyway! Prices of food have been jumping up and down in our local area. I have been using a freezer to help with our budget. Most people do not know that cheese and milk can be frozen. We pick them up when on sale. No need for a club membership and often cheaper if you shop right. Same for meat, veggies, ice cream, pizza and the standard freezer stockpile. Jan 2014 UPDATE: After a year and a half use, the freezer is working even better than expected with no issues at all! Just like the prices of food going up, same for this freezer. Glad I got it when it was 249. You might want to do a bit of shopping before you click. Amazon added the specifications on this model and the 150 watt rating makes it one of the lowest on the globe.

Nevertheless, it is the perfect size even if the baskets were not included: two times now, I have had to dig to the bottom for buried items, and, except for cold hands, it is really not bad of a task. It was priced comparably that could be purchased locally, and with free SuperSaver shipping and no tax, it was a steal, especially since it was delivered right through our front door and into the living room where it is now. Other than that what can I say? It hasn't stopped running since when I first plugged it in two months ago, but also an important point: it is absolutely quiet.

I thought maybe a 10 to 13 cu. ft. model would be appropriate, but for just 2 people, this 7 cu ft model is more than sufficient - it's larger than we expected. The unit is about 120 pounds so be prepared for moving something of this weight - 2 people will be needed to move/load/unload/position this unit. As others have said, the unit is very quiet, in fact I don't know if it even makes noise! I thought I could hear it humming and then realized the hum was coming from the overhead fluorescent lights! The unit comes with a partitioned section - and the partition can be easily removed if necessary, as well as a decent sized removable wire basket. My wife and I both thought a 2nd basket would be nice - we're going to see if we can find something that will work. The power light on the front is a nice visual to ensure the unit is powered on. The main reason I wanted to write this review is to warn people to check the temperature with a thermometer. The instructions state to put the adjustable thermostat to the max position (fully clockwise) initially to cool it down quickly, and then readjust the dial to the center position (12 o'clock) for normal running. There are no indications on what setting will provide what level of cooling, but after we had left it in the mid-position for 24 hours, I checked the temperature with a Fluke digital thermometer. I even checked the meter by comparing the temp of the freezer in our refrigerator (which actually has a digital readout of the internal temperature) to make sure it was accurate...and it was. The Danby manual suggests keeping the temp at close to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) to be most efficient. You want it cold enough obviously to keep your food frozen, but you don't want it so cold that you're just wasting energy/money. I was surprised to find that the temperature was at -15 degrees Fahrenheit when the dial was set to the mid-position at 12 o'clock. I've had to make several adjustments but the freezer is finally at the recommended temperature and my dial (if this was a clock) is pointing between 9 and 10 o'clock. I'm sure there will be some variance from one unit to another, so I would definitely recommend everyone check their freezer temp, regardless of brand and model, to ensure you're keeping your food at the proper temperature. It probably makes sense to continue to check it periodically over time and as the amount of food in the freezer changes as well (nearly empty to nearly full...?)", "id": "3741331"}

It has a good amount of storage space for it's size and I like that it has a basket for access to smaller items.

The unit is remarkably quiet and the temperature is consistent without increasing my power bill much... and it gets very very cold. Exactly what you want a freezer to do. It has been running a couple months and the buildup of ice along the sides is very minimal so it does not appear to need a defrosting often. One thing you do NOT want in a freezer like this is auto defrost since that will shorten the life of any of your frozen food. The unit arrived at my door, undamaged and well packed.

{"review": "I need this chest freezer to store breast milk (my kitchen freezer is completely full, leaving no room for food), and this particular one fits the space I have available for it. I'm limited in what I can buy by size specifications. The first time I ordered it, the box was damaged and the freezer itself was dirty on the outside, presumably from a freon leak. I'm guessing the chest freezer was banged around and damaged during shipping. If freezers tip too far during shipping, the freon will leak out and render it defective. Sure enough, when we plugged it in it was a complete dud. It never cooled. I couldn't even hear the appliance running (because it wasn't running). It took a few weeks to get a refund from Danby, and they refused to replace it, which I don't understand. They did refund me in full. I had to arrange for pick up, which was a pain. Why would they be willing to send a carrier to pick up, and be unwilling to send a carrier to replace the unit? Makes no sense to me. So I'm ordering it again because I need it. I'll be leaving specific instructions for the shippers to handle delicately, per instructions on the box, to keep upright, and not to tip it. We'll see how it goes...", "id": "3741331"}

Inside there is a small ledge toward the bottom as well as a basket that hangs at the top. It is very spacious and has allowed us to reclaim our regular freezer for food. I also love that it opens from the top, so it would be very unlikely that the door would be left ajar causing items to thaw.

Update 2: Amazon has generously agreed to accept a return of this item and refund me in full though it is past the date by which I should have done this. The freezer noises only got worse. Update 3: I highly recommend that if you do buy this product despite the bad reviews that you keep the box and the packaging in case you have to return it! (Keep it for at least 2 months.

The noise would occur intermittently at first and after a week of use, would not stop, no matter how much effort was put into trying get it perfectly level. The replacement I received works just fine with basic, crude levelling adjustments of front legs. I have even tilted the freezer partially when it is running to try and see if this one makes the same noise when not perectly level, and it it never made the noise.

{"review": "My regular freezer is small so I wanted a little extra freezer space. I chose between the SPT UF-150W and the Haier HUM013EA. The SPT supposedly has a minutely larger volume, but the Haier was about $50 less and apparently more popular. In reality they are probably close to identical. I picked the SPT because there were a lot of complaints about poor packaging of the Haier. The SPT came double-boxed in heavy-duty cardboard with re-enforced corners and styrofoam padding. The freezer was in perfect condition. It works great and is EXTREMELY QUIET when the compresser is running and totally silent when it's not running. It comes with a minature ice tray to monitor how effectively it is freezing. The SPT has a lock on the door, a worthless feature for my needs. As for the Haier, my review title is a little misleading as I can't actually comment on it. However, I do have a Haier small appliance which did not come as well packaged as my freezer. The SPT is currently $183, about $15 less than I paid. In hindsight I would likely go with the SPT again to avoid packaging issues.", "id": "3741331"}

{"review": "I rated this 5 stars, even though the first freezer I was sent had to be returned. I wish I had read this in the reviews, but here is what happened. The Freezer was shipped with no markings saying \"This End Up\" or \"Fridge Enclosed - do not Tip\". It arrived via UPS, we plugged it in, and instantly it began to make this horribly loud grinding noise. We were horrified, as this was going in my niece's dorm room and would wake up half the floor if it continued to make that noise. 20 min later, a contractor friend of mine told me that it must have been tipped over during shipping, and it needed to sit for 24 hrs so the Freon or whatever fluid he said had seeped into the compressor because it had been tipped over or sideways, could drain out. We tried that - unplugging it for 36hrs, but the moment we plugged it back in... the noise was back. We left it plugged in for 12 hours, but the noise didn't stop. As frustrating as this was, I had read previous reviews where people said this was a very quiet freezer that made only a trickling noise, so I was determined to give it another chance. We returned the freezer and had a new one shipped out. Again, no markings on the box, but we made sure at least from the UPS driver to her dorm, that the box didn't get tipped. (He noted that the box should have been labeled as I suggested above, otherwise UPS guys probably would not know to keep it upright). We also let the freezer sit (before plugging it in) for 24 hrs. Finally - we plugged it in and... whala! There was the soft trickling noise we were hoping for, and no loud Compressor! She has used it for 2 weeks and loves it. Two things that could have saves us a TON of trouble: if The Box had been labeled properly (DO NOT TIP, etc.). and if the instruction manual had said not to turn it on for 24 hrs after if has possibly been tipped. Luckily for me, my contractor friend knew what was happening, but all in all it shouldn't have had to be that difficult.", "id": "3741331"}

They recommend that you wipe and dry with a damp cloth before starting up and also turn the temp to Max from normal position for 2 hours before using. Then turn back to Normal at the end of 2 hours and load it up. You also get a very small ice tray with this and an ice/frost scrapper for defrosting if the need arises.

This was super easy to apply (I did it in less than 5 minutes for two freezers) and since it just looks like a couple of plastic squares sticking to my freezers, my boyfriend (who is very strong) had to \"try\" it the other day. He laughed and said the double sided tape appeared weak and that the plastic wrapped wire cable in between was overkill and then proceeded to try and pull the cable out of the plastic or the plastic off of the freezer to no avail. He was very impressed, as was I. I thought there was no way he would not get it pulled off, but he could not no matter how hard he pulled.

{"review": "I finally decided to take the plunge and by this to keep some people out of my mini fridge. I have a mini fridge pretty much the same color as what is in the photo, which is why I bought this item. Upon receiving this item, I read the instructions to see if there was anything I might miss if I just skipped them. This item comes with the following: 1 Black Colored Anchor Clip. 1 Silver Colored Anchor Clip, 1 Master Lock, 2 Alcohol Wipes, and 1 Scrubby Pad. The instructions read: \"2. Clean and prepare the chosen pad locations with the included kit. Use the scrubby pad to clean the attachment location, wipe area clean with the alcohol swab. Let dry completely\" Easy enough. And having done this a million times with other adhesive products, I didn't think would be any issues. Boy was I wrong! The \"scrubby pad\" doesn't just clean the attachment area, IT SCRATCHES THE CRAP OUT OF IT!!! I looked back through the instructions. NOPE! NO WARNING ABOUT SCRATCHING SURFACES!!! I thought \"well, maybe there us just soap residue in the pad, and maybe it needs to be cleaned better\". Nope! It's scratched! If there was a warning that said something like, \" be sure to only use the scrubby pad to clean an area NO BIGGER than the size one of the Anchor Clips will cover\", I would have been MUCH more careful with the included scrubby pad! But, no such warning exists! And, since I was just scrubbing the general area I was going to attach the Silver Colored Anchor Clip to my Stainless looking (I say looking because I don't know how it could actually be now that it's scratched to crap by what appeared to be a simple cleaning pad) mini fridge door, now I have scratch marks all around where the Anchor Clip is secured. :( Like I said, I tried cleaning the area with my alcohol spay bottle and some paper towels in the hope that it was just some sort of residue, but it isn't. The best I could do is use the scrubby pad even more around the Anchor Clip to try to make it look...umm...better? But, instead it just looks like I was being dumb, using the incorrect tools for the job. Too bad, they were the tools that were INCLUDED to do the job! Even though no one will really see it other than (the people who aren't supposed to be trying to get what's inside) me, it's just going to infuriate me off every time I go to get a drink! I'm not really sure how well this product actually works yet, seeming I just received it today, and also because the instructions say not to use the lock with it for 48 hours after attaching the Anchor Clips because \"full adhesive strength is not achieved for 48 hrs\". So, IF you are going to buy this item, this is what I recommend: 1. ONLY use the \"scrubby pad\" to prep an area which is SMALLER than the actual surface of the Anchor Clip. 2. Use your OWN alcohol and paper towels to clean the attachment location. The wipes they include are not enough to clean this area adequately enough.

It has a crease-like dent on the right side where it will not be seen, but if it was packaged a little better, that could be avoided. So far it runs fine and is very quiet. Being as I have very little extra room in my kitchen, this will serve my needs for extra freezer space to be able to take advantage of sales.

{"review": "I bought this item for camping, as we can never keep anything cold for the ten days we go. It's nice and small, holds alot of food, it got so cold that we had to leave the ice cream out for a bit to get a spoon into it. It would be a great item for the house to buy food in bulk, it did not freeze up inside or cause any cold burns on food. I would buy this item again, good price with Amazon.com about $140.00 cheaper than going local.", "id": "678542011"}

{"review": "This freezer is just the size we needed. My concern was either I am going to get it without any damage. While reading the reviews, I found it doesn't come in proper packaging, which is absolutely true. In the owner's manual I found, \"warranty does not cover Damages in shipping\". No doubt Haier needed to mention it for their protection. But Amazon did their best by repacking it with bubble wraps. Mine arrived in perfect condition. After 2 days I setup the freezer on kitchen counter top. Set the temperature control dial to \"4\" as recommended. Waited 24 hours before plug in. Few minutes after plug in my wife asked me from the living room, \"What is that noise\"? Yes the freezer was making that noise. I went through the reviews and found, almost five people reviewed this freezer as very quiet, no one complained about the noise. We thought may be after running 1 or 2 days it will come down but unfortunately it did not. We have another approximate 18 cubic-foot refrigerator in the kitchen but that doesn't make even half the noise this freezer makes. At night we can hear it any place from our 900 sqft apartment. The compressor is running almost continuously. It stops just for 4 to 5 minutes after few hours of running. My other refrigerator's compressor remains off most of the time. I checked the manual and found everything is fine from my end. I have 2 inches gap from the top but at least 6 inches gap from other sides. Room temperature is between 68F to 72F. Door is closing tightly and at least one third space is free inside. After 24 hours running, I unplugged the freezer, reset the temperature dial to 4 again and plugged in after 10 minutes. One more thing, both sides of the freezer get warm. But it might not be a problem. As I had another Samsung refrigerator that used to do the same. The good thing about the freezer, it is cooling properly. I am looking for alternatives but still did not find any better reviewed freezer with this size. It is only two days I am using the freezer. I will check one or two more days and then would request Amazon to replace it. Hopefully only this one has something wrong with it. If I find the next one better, I will update my review. 1 star less for high end noise (close to 18kHz frequency). 1 star less for continuous compressor running. 1 stat less for poor packaging. Update 10/14/2011 I got the second freezer. Fortunately noise level is acceptable, close to my other freezer. Also compressor remained off most of the time. Unfortunately, it came damaged. Both sides were dented. Not only that lot of markings or scratches on the top. I think, right side door rubber came out. Glue was used to seal it again but it was not done properly. Some portion is still open and one or two area is too stretched for using glue in an inappropriate manner. I could accept other things but door rubber is giving me uncomfortable feeling about the longevity. Definitely door rubber and top scratches were not made during shipping. It might be a refurbished one. Amazon felt sorry and going to ship me another one. I feel sorry that Amazon is paying two way shipping. I also don't feel that I should pay the shipping. All of these could overcome if Haier made the packing little better, not sending Amazon refurbished items as new one and kept an eye on quality control. Update 10/19/2011 For the last 2 or 3 days, I have started using my 3rd one. So far everything seems good. It makes even lower noise than the 2nd freezer. I don't expect any lower noise from any freezer. I set the temperature control dial to even below \"3\" (7 is highest and 1 is lowest)), even though compressor is running most of the time. I am skeptical about the quality and how long this freezer may last. How can same model 3 freezers produce different noise level? After going through all the hassles, I could not update my ratings more than 3 stars.", "id": "678542011"}

I can fill it full of ice cube trays and have ice in less than 30 min. Probably 12 trays, thats a bag of ice in the woods. I also have a portable ice maker. So, this would be a backup if needed.

{"review": "Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Here are some facts: 1. This unit replaced a Badger-1 disposal which had come with our house when we bought it new in 2004. I didn't even know what type we had until I took it out. We had been happy with the Badger but it eventually stopped working. Doing some research after-the-fact, I learn the Badger-1 only has a 1/3 hp motor and 1 year warranty. The Waste King L-8000 has a full 1 hp motor and a lifetime (non-transferable) warranty. 2. Though the Badger-1 only had 1/3 of the power of the L-8000, the Waste King was actually quieter. We didn't think either of them was loud, but the Waste King was even quieter. 3. There are basically two types of disposal mounts nowadays. If you have an existing disposal, the odds are nearly 100% that it's installed utilizing either a 3-bolt mount system or the EZ mount system. If you are planning to replace a disposal that required a 3-bolt mount system (such as the Badger-1) with a disposal that requires the EZ mount system (such as the Waste King) you will also need to purchase the following adapter kit: Anaheim Mfg Co 3 Bolt Mount Adapter Kit 3101. * The above adapter kit is sold here on Amazon for less than $10 and is very easy to install. All you do is swap out two pieces that came with your EZ mount disposal with the two pieces in the kit. You will then be able to connect your new EZ mount disposal to a sink that contains 3-bolt mount hardware. On a scale of 1-10, I would say that the difficulty factor was a 1 or 2. Easy! Additionally, Anaheim Mfg Co (the company that makes the adapter kit) is the same company that manufactures Waste King disposals. So, everything fit perfectly and effortlessly. 4. I had never done any plumbing but I was able to do this myself. Total time was around 2 hours... but I took my time and also (as the instructions recommended) took time to disassemble most of the plastic plumbing from underneath the sink and cleaned them out real well. I was surprised how much gunk had accumulated. 5. The instructions list nine items or tools it thinks you might need to get the job done... but you will likely need much less. I only needed two tools myself: a screwdriver and a hacksaw. The screwdriver was used to tighten the three screws of the 3-bolt mount system while the hacksaw was used to slightly shorten a couple plastic pieces (the horizontal sink pipe leading from main sink line to disposal & the discharge elbow coming off the disposal). 6. Another concern I had was whether the different lengths of the Badger disposal versus my Waste King disposal might cause plumbing alignment problems when I tried to put everything back together. It was not an issue. I'm now guessing the actual plumbing location within the different brands of disposals are standard. In other words, if one disposal is 16 inches deep while the other is 20 deep inches deep, both would have plumbing entering the disposal at 9 inches down from the top. 7. I bought this unit after seeing Consumer Reports (Aug 2009 issue) rate it highest out of six disposals they tested. They also showed the price as $230, so seeing it on Amazon for much less and reading all the positive reviews made it a no brainer. Hope this helps!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Our Waste King 8000 replaced an Insinkerator Badger 5 that cracked and began leaking. This review is for people in the same situation, and it's written to help you get your do-it-yourself installation right the first time. I'll refer to your old Badger as the \"ISE.\" *** SUMMARY: Either buy the 3101, then throw it out the next day and do it all over again when you're dissatisfied with the appearance, or don't buy the 3101 and do it right the first time. *** Your ISE was probably mounted with a 3-bolt mounting system. You'll be able to tell by looking at the point where the ISE meets the sink. If you see three long bolts pointing straight up and down, spread out evenly around the cylinder, then that's what you have. This Waste King model is an EZ-mount, which is a different kind of mount. So you have two choices. First choice: order the \"3101 ISE Adapter Kit,\" which allows an EZ-mount Waste King to attach to an existing 3-bolt mount. This is definitely the easiest solution. HOWEVER, a couple things to consider. One, in the process of removing the ISE, you'll probably twist the mount enough to cause the old plumber's putty to begin disintegrating. If you have any sort of perfectionist streak in you or personal pride about your handyman abilities, you'll want to go to the hardware store to get new plumber's putty (about $2), disassemble the mount, clean it, and then put it all back together with a new layer of putty. This is almost exactly the same amount of work as if you'd just removed the 3-bolt mount, thrown it away, and freshly mounted the Waste King. Two, if you use the existing 3-bolt system, then your sink drain's rim will continue to say \"IN-SINK-ERATOR\" even though you probably now hate that brand for manufacturing a Badger that failed after only a few years. Toss it all out and you'll have a brand-new rim that proudly proclaims your new allegiance to Waste King. Second choice: Skip the 3101 and switch to EZ-mount. I recommend this. It's not as hard as it might sound. You'll need to unscrew three bolts, then carefully pry out the metal ring that holds the whole thing in place. Toss it all out and you should be left with a sink drain hole that you can scrub clean (but resist the urge to turn on the faucet at this point!). Follow the easy instructions that came with the Waste King, and you'll be done in about 30 minutes. As for the disposal itself compared to the Badger, a few things to consider: - The sink opening is narrower. This means you'll need to chop that brown apple in half first. - The Waste King makes a very brief, scary sound when you start it up. You'll think for a moment you dropped a spoon down the drain. But it's literally about a tenth of a second long, and the owner's manual says it's normal. Ours seems to have loosened up after a few days, and now it's barely noticeable. - The new disposal is slightly quieter. I got used to a certain sound change that told me everything was (or all too often wasn't) ground up in the ISE. I'll need to retrain my ear. - The disposal is a few inches longer than the Badger. But the connections are all at the same height (unless you do the 3101 method, which moves the connections about a half-inch lower). You might want to save the black L-shaped drain pipe from the Badger, because it has already been cut to the right size for the connection to your drain system. All in all, we're very happy we took the time to investigate alternatives rather than reflexively ordering another Badger. The Waste King is a good product.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Quiet and fast. Has stopper that really works. Small bin makes accidents less likely, and I have not dropped any tableware in yet. One thing that you must do.

{"review": "I ordered this Waste King L-8000 to replace a wimpier 3/4hp model that had been installed for about 8 years. The old model still worked and was decent, but had recently committed a grievous error... Once a week i host my friends for dinner, usually its pizza and beer and we watch a game, but during the summer months it turns to BBQ and assorted cooked meats. On one of these occasions, i tossed in a chicken drumstick and a few Buffalo wing bones, flicked on the disposal and waited for 30 seconds of god awful racket and grinding to destroy the refuse of our sumptuous feast. It had failed miserably... bone shards were visibly numerous, and the drumstick was practically whole! My friends immediately began hooting and hollering about how much of a sissy disposal i had (as only beer fueled friends can) and as you can imagine, i received quite a few Waste king links on Amazon shortly after from the aforementioned buddies. In my shame and fury, i selected the 1 HP Waste King 8000 and ordered it immediately due to its good reviews and evidently unbridled power to destroy the scraps of my feedings without remorse. I was not disappointed! The day after it was installed, we BBQ'd and kept every bone we flayed. I crammed in a dozen buffallo wings, half a cup of endamame shells and 4 chicken drumsticks to start and engaged the L-8000. MADNESS!! The Good King ANNIHILATED the offering and screamed for more! MORE!!! Every bone, shell, scrap and morsel of gristle was fed into its angry maw as it howled in a frenzy of destruction! After it spun down, i checked the interior, nothing remained save a few paltry specks of gristle and the haunting smell of an Apex Predator. My friends were very impressed, honor was returned to my Condo, and now i have an unstoppable Garbage disposal that is just waiting to destroy anything i can throw at it. Thank you, Amazon. And thank you, Waste King for making a disposal that makes WAR with meat bones in a manner most fitting.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I have been using this product for almost 6 months now and it is great. After installation, I have taken its flawless performance for granted. It was substantially larger than the small wimpy disposal that came with our house, but also surprisingly quieter; more like the guttural growl of a menacing bulldog than a loud but harmless chihuahua. A couple of pieces of advice - make sure it will fit under your sink (it barely fit under mine), and create an outlet to plug it into instead of trying to directly wire it since it comes with a plug you would have to otherwise cut out.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I bought this disposer over 3 months ago, but due to delays with kitchen cabinets delivery the installation had to wait until this past week. We have a cast-iron deep Kohler Deerfield sink, and my plumber was in charge of the installation. The EZ mount assembly was connected per instructions, yet the disposer would shake violently when turned on. We contacted Waste King tech support and were told that L-8000 EZ mount was not compatible with cast iron sinks of the type we had, and a 3 bolt mount system would work better (meaning purchasing a different model with a 3-bolt assembly). Mentioning the adapter kit, were told that there were no adapters or flanges were available to address the problem with a cast iron sink. I tried calling Amazon, explaining that even though it was past 90 days nowhere in the description did it say that L-8000 was not compatible with deep-well cast iron sinks. I was told I will only get back 20% of what I paid. I ended up purchasing a 3/4 HP KitchenAid Superba disposer with a 3-bolt mount and a steel connector to flange, which was a lot more substantial than the plastic EZ mount connector on the Waste King. It was connected and working in under 30 mins. The plastic connecting parts was another reason I felt uneasy about L-8000 or other Waste King disposers, despite the longer warranty. Excepting the more expensive batch-feed Waste King disposers, most had an all-plastic neck mount construction when it seemed stainless steel would have been a better (although more expensive) choice. I was swayed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this model, which for all I know may be deserved, plastic parts or not. Amazon and Waste King should do a much better job stating clearly that the L-8000 is not intended to be used with deep-well cast iron sinks. EDIT: After I wrote to Amazon, the rep graciously allowed to return the item for a full refund. 5 stars for Amazon standing by their warehouse-deals affiliate and reputation as a reliable vendor.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I replaced a piece of ISE Badger junk with this unit. When the ISE seized, the shaft seal went out, and it leaked internally. So I had no dishwasher unless I wanted to do the bucket brigade from below the disposer to the other side of the sink. Galvanized wetted parts plainly aren't the way to go for this service. I had pretty well decided on the WK 3300 while researching / looking locally and then tried Amazon, finding it much cheaper. Since the WK 8000 was even cheaper, at the top of the Consumers Reports list, and Aneheim Mfg. offers a lifetime warranty (original purchaser), it was an obvious choice. So I went the WK Direct / Cantex Trading route, with no problems. I ordered early on a Sunday morning; it arrived Wed. afternoon; and was running that nite. The paperwork says it came from Austin, TX. Included are both handwritten and printed notes that urge you to leave feedback at Amazon and contact them directly if you can't give 5 stars in every category; their staff receives bonus based on the feedback. Maybe when they shipped that customer the defective unit in early Sept., somebody at Cantex noticed the review, and has taken action to avoid a repeat. EZ-mount: I was sure to get this, because I wanted the removable rubber baffle. (How else do you get the grunge off that thing?) It should be a simpler install for most people. Only concern is that the vibration will loosen the plastic locknut, but I guess the mfr. has looked at this. Anyway, it's accessible to tighten if it happens. Rubber gasket under the sink flange instead of messing with the plumber's putty - yea! Two-position locking ring (hold the unit up but let it swivel / locked in place) - yea!. The instructions implore you many times to be sure to get the lower cushion mount in right. If the locking ring would slide higher - up over the flange threads - it would really help with this feat. Plumbing: Since this WK is larger in both height and diameter, this just required hack sawing the plastic pipe and outlet nozzle for a fit. Electrical: Didn't have to disconnect the old unit; just cut the romex and installed a plug. No telling how many 2-prong female plugs there are in my house, but had to make the dash to the local hardware for a grounded one. Mounted the plugs high on the rear sink compartment wall with a zip tie to help avoid them seeing water. Noise: Can't understand other comments; my unit is much quieter than the Badger 5, even without the detergent trick. It's a ss sink.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Just finished installing it tonight. I have installed my fair share of disposals over the years, and this installation was by far one of the most troublesome. Very important: make sure the locking ring at the bottom of the sink flange can slide over the rubber gasket. I had the gasket too high on the sink flange and spent 2 hours trying to push the disposer high enough to lock in place with the locking ring, and of course it didn't work--very, very frustrating!! The fix was to pull the rubber gasket lower, which allowed the locking ring to twist freely over the gasket. Had to do all this while on the floor under the sink, so it wasn't much fun. As for the electrical connection, this is a replacement disposal, and the old disposal was direct wired. So I decided to remove the included 3-prong cord and direct wire this disposal to the switched wire rather than install a receptacle under the sink. It wasn't overly difficult, but in the end, it would have been less work to just install a receptacle under the sink. If you have this decision, add the receptacle and just use the attached 3-prong cord. Looking forward to getting good use from this top rated consumer reports disposal, just wish it had been a little easier to install. Good luck.", "id": "680343011"}

Updated 2/7/12: Doesn't grind anything too fiberous like lemons, oranges or onions. TOO NOISY!! I think this one is defective! It's hard to believe other customers can rate this unit a 5 star.

{"review": "Upside: Very easy to install, good instructions in both the paper manual and the Waste King online video. We replaced a contractor grade 1/3hp Badger in a Kohler porcelain sink (not deep well) that had a three screw mount with lock ring. The Easy Mount kit fit just fine, and installed with minimal effort. The only thing I needed that wasn't in the packaging was the plumbers putty. Install time: 1 hr which included a complete run-through before final assembly. Operation: Very quite, and very powerful. Beats the pants off that Badger. Downside: The Waste King \"Disposal Flange\" is integral to the installation. This means that even though we have a matching Disposal Flange (and stopper) that matches our faucet hardware, it doesn't work with the Waste King. Secondly I don't like the fact Waste King has branding all over the silver Flange in the bottom of the sink. I'll buy their hardware but I have no desire to see their brand every time I use the sink. I'd order the *matching color* Flange off their website, but I'm pretty sure they have branding on it as well.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "After reading the reviews here, I went to Home Depot this morning and bought the Compact. I planned to install it myself, and did not buy any extras. I could always run back to the store if I needed. The hardest part of the entire installation was getting the old disposal out. I think it was the original installed by the builder 20 years ago. Once I got the old one out, the rest was a breeze. The instructions covered everything well enough that I had no problems, inspite of my wife's questions about whether or not I had ever done something like this before. I did not have to move or replace any plumbing. I did need my wife to push down on the sink collar while I attached the rings underneath. Everything went together well, no leaks. I even took the tension clamp off the old one and used to secure the power cord coming from the wall. The moment of truth came: I flipped the switch and I was stunned! The box said 40% quiter than the Badger line, but this thing is 80% quieter than what it replaced! I was wowed! Called the wife in to see my handiwork, and she was wowed! (I'm her hero!) With the old disposal, you could not watch TV or have a conversation in that end of the house when it ran. Now, you can stand at the sink and whisper while it runs. There is a low hum, and a very mild vibration. InSinkErator makes a much larger 1 h.p. unit with a stainless steel case that claims to be 60% quiter than the Badger line. I would be afraid you couldn't tell it was on if it was that much quiter than the Compact. This unit is the best buy around, and would be worth it even at a higher price (but don't let InSinkErator get wind of that). I highly recommend the Compact, and in fact, I would recommend that you not get any other brand!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "InSinkErator Compact Evolution Household Food Waste Disposer, Gray Pros: - These current generation InSinkErators could be the quietest and most vibration-free disposers on the market. The case itself is insulated; the sink-drain connector assembly's metal parts are rubber cushioned; plus the discharge pipe flange is rubber. These anti-vibration innovations work. When no water or waste is in the unit, all you hear is a mild hum. If it was much quieter and you wouldn't know it was on. - It performs as you would expect for an excellent disposer. Nothing we've fed it has failed to be ground-up and flushed away. - 3/4 HP has been more than enough to get the job done. - It's the smallest of the high-end disposers, giving more room to store things in your sink-base cabinet, and more room for your body when working on under-sink plumbing. - It's good looking and looks expensive. - About as easy to install as possible, for a disposer. Have a small container of plumber's putty on hand before you begin. You might also need some medium sized wire nuts. - A four-year in-home warranty confirms the manufacturer's confidence in their product's reliability. Other - Years ago, the most common method of electrifying a disposer was to hard-wire it by connecting an NM (non-metallic sheathed) cable directly to the disposer (which is why no cord is provided). A safer method is to use a cord such as the InSinkErator Power Cord Kit #CRD-00, and plug that cord into a receptacle in the sink-base cabinet. (It's \"safer\" because otherwise, someone could turn the circuit breaker back on while you're working on the disposer, and electrocute you. With a cord, unplugging it is a sure means of power disconnect.) If there is no receptacle there, feed the existing NM cable into a utility box and install one; turn the power off first. Use a receptacle tester (sold by Amazon) to verify proper wiring. If you have the skills to hard-wire a disposer, you should have the skills to install a surface-mounted box and receptacle. (Your county may require a permit to do this work. Whether you get one is up to you.) -If you are connecting a dishwasher to the disposer, you might need the InSinkErator Dishwasher Connector Kit #DWC-00. Some dishwashers, such as Kitchen Aid models, do not need the kit, because their discharge hose connects without modification to an InSinkErator. Cons: - InSinkErator should design the unit so a special three-prong cord [they could sell] plugs and twist-locks into the bottom of the disposer, while still allowing for a hard-wired option. That would eliminate all wiring directly to the disposer, preventing end-user miswiring of the cord. Summary: This disposer is obviously the result of many generations of InSinkErator improvements; a 5-star appliance.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I bought this based on the recommendations and reviews here--just installed it last night. It is fabulous! The first time I turned it on I thought it had gotten jammed or something because it was SO QUIET! I turned it off, got out the jam wrench and hit the restart button--only to find out it had been running! You guys warned me, but it is SO TRUE! After the first initial start, you have to listen to hear it run! Couple of things on installation-- I did this all by myself (female), all on my own, had never done this before! It took about three hours--I also installed the new flange, even though not needed, because it was so pretty (probably added an hour to the job). Use the trick shown in the directions to keep the flange still while you install everything else--completely worth the extra time. Just read the directions--it's easy. And don't forget to pop out the dishwasher plug if you have one. One other trick--I had a difficult time given the angle, weight, etc., holding the disposal in place and twisting it onto the mount. Tried a couple of things to support the weight and then got my CAR JACK (!!!!) out of the back of my car. I balanced the disposal on the jack and simply hoisted it in place, then twisted it onto the mount! VOILA! Easy as pie!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I was debating whether to get this model or the comparable 3/4 horsepower WasteKing version. I chose this one for the following reasons: - Consumer Reports magazine ranked the Evolution Compact as being a quieter unit. Quietness is one of the things I care most about in a disposal. I think any 3/4 horsepower unit will do a great job in an average household kitchen, so in the end quietness and build quality are what separate the units. Based on my actual usage of the product (purchased it recently) I am surprised how much quieter it is than the Insinkerator Badger 1 it replaced. I'd say it's about 50%-60% quieter. Its sounds like how the Badger 1 sounds when it's jammed and you turn it on -- just a hum. I am VERY satisfied on that front. - The WasteKing has a higher rotation speed but the grinding mechanics of the Evolution Compact seemed to make up for it based on my reading of the on-line product documentation. It's as if the WasteKing has to make up for the less advanced grinding technology with higher speed in order to win the \"specs\" battle. - The WasteKing does not have a hole in the bottom for you to put a wrench into to loosen jams. Their sales documentation says you don't need one because the motor is so powerful it will not jam -- whatever. If that is the case then why does the product's user guide instruct you to stick a broom stick in the disposal and twirl it around if it ever gets jammed??? I think not having a wrench hole is a way to keep the price low. And saying the unit is so powerful you don't need a wrench hole is a way for their marketing department to hide the product weaknesses and push units. Stuff like this let's you know that WasteKing has cut corners to get the price so low. - Based on reading the on-line product documentation, visiting the manufacturer Web sites, and reading user comments I concluded, in my opinion, that the Insinkerator was a higher quality product -- even with the shorter warranty. Yes, the comparable WasteKing model has an 8-year warranty and has a higher rotation speed, but that doesn't mean it's better built. Honda's are know to have some of the shortest warranties in the auto biz, but their brand is consistently ranked among the highest for long-term quality. - The WasteKing just looked cheap. I read some of the WasteKing comments and some of them mentioned it being made of cheap plastic. The Evolution Compact looks like, and after installing it in my kitchen I can also say, feels and sounds like a quality product. - Insinkerator has a 4-year come to your home warranty where they'll send someone to fix it. To me that has more weight than a 8 year warranty that I will likely not be able to take advantage of when I move in 5 years or so. - I often find that you get what you pay for. The WasteKing being so much cheaper kind of worried me. All in all I am very happy with my purchase. BTW: If you buy this unit and have a dishwasher, don't forget step 16 when installing it! You have to knock out the drain plug and remove it from inside the disposer. I forgot to do it and so my dishwasher didn't function properly. After uninstalling the product and following step 16 all was well. Also, be sure when you install it to make sure all three of those metal install tabs/points are firmly secure. -- UPDATE ON 1/9/14 --- Over 3 years later, this thing still runs like a champ. Smooth and quiet. No complaints. I did have to call customer service to get a replacement tubing parts that I lost when I installed a new sink and cabinet. They were a pleasure to deal with and sent me the parts free of charge. Definitely a 5 star product and company.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Five years after purchasing this, not only has the motor burned up, but the bottom is just about to rust through. I don't find this acceptable, as the previous (Kenmore) model lasted more than 20 years. And those 20 years were the years spent with 6-8 people in the house, now it is just two of us. I'm disappointed to say the least, and absolutely FED UP with planned obsolescence. Obviously IT IS (or was?) possible to make a disposal that lasted a lot longer.

{"review": "Our 9+ year old builder-installed GE 1/3HP disposall had finally bit the bucket. The inside had corroded and one of the teeth had broken off and blew into a million pieces. While it worked, it was time for a replacement. My wife and I had succumbed to ISE advertising and immediately decided to get an ISE. Well, almost. I actually did a bit of research but when it came down to it, there isn't much in the way of disposal review. Anyway, off to Home Depot. One thing I did know was that I wasn't going to $299 for a garbage disposal. Once in the store I realized that the Compact was only a few ounces shy in capacity then the Evolution Essential. So, I bought it for $159. I am a pretty handy guy with LOTSA tools so removal of the old and installation of the new didn't faze me at all. But I must warn you, if you are removing an old disposal like I was, you probably won't be saving any hardware except the drain pipes. This means you'll need to add some plumbers putty to your cart*. Also, take a look and see if your disposal uses a plug or is hardwired directly into your panel. Most are hardwired. If it isn't, you can use the one from your old disposal for your new...unless it is in bad shape. *The Tools and Materials list is as follows (and doesn't match the outside of the box): cable connector, plumbers putty, wire nuts, hammer, straight & cross tip screw drivers, channel locks, putty knife, hack saw. I reused everything except the GE flange so the only thing I needed was the putty. Your installation may be different. The instructions are well laid out and very easy to follow. The only issue I had was the metal snap ring. It wasn't really an issue, but I don't think that I could have inserted it without my wife holding the flange down from the top. Wiring the new was the reverse of dismantling the old. Again, straight forward and simple. Once I attached the unit and snapped it into place it felt loose. Then I realized that it was the rubber mounting and it was supposed to be like this. This adds to the quietness (like how equipment is installed on a submarine with rubber mounting gaskets) and allows the unit to `bounce' a bit. After assuring that I had a good seal...it was time for the moment of truth. WOW was this thing quiet...really quite. I couldn't image that the 299 model was actually quieter than this. I had the same giddy smile as when I tried my new (replacement) dishwasher for the first time. You could actually have a conversation in the kitchen while using it. While I haven't had the opportunity to grind, say, potato or carrot peals or month-old stuff from the back of the fridge, it's been great. I am sure that this will be a disposal that will be with us for years to come!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I can't say enough about how happy I am with the Evolution Compact disposal from InSinkErator. I had a fairly high end Kenmore disposal for about a year. It did a good job but was noisy. Then this year there was a fire in my condo unit that resulted in several rooms having to be rebuilt, one of which was the kitchen. When working up the remodeling details, I ran across the Evolution Compact at Home Depot. I wasn't up-to-speed on this new series so I went home and read up as much material as I could find. In short, though I didn't really need a new disposal, I decided to give it a try to see if I could reduce the noise in the kitchen. I am SO GLAD I spent the money for the Evolution Compact. It is significantly quieter than the Kenmore. My sink doesn't rattle like it's going to come loose from the countertop when the disposal is running. Best of all, the Evolution quickly gets rid of anything I've thrown at it, all they while doing it quietly. One thing that attracted my eye in the store was the blue color of unit. It stood out from all the blacks and greys around. While appearence in not necessarily something you look for in a garbage disposal, it does project the image of a high-quality, high-end appliance, something that can be a positive if for any reason you decide to sell your home. I highly recommend the Evolution Series to anyone looking for a new garbage disposal. I agree with a prior reviewer, there are other places where you find the Evolution Compact for $159 so it's worth shopping around unless you live in an area where you have to make a long drive to get to a home center like Lowes or Home Depot.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Nobody would want to replace the garbage disposer every few years. I have gone through three InSinkErators since remodel of my house in 2000. Each time the ingenious mounting design kept me taking the shortcut - buying another ISE so I wouldn't have to remove the sink mount. However, there was a brand new one out of the box that was off-balance and noisy (thanks to Home Depot's easy exchange policy). This time, an ISE 444 gradually failed after six years, just two years after the the warranty expired! I just bought and installed an ISE Evolution Compact. It works well, very quiet. With an engineer's curiosity, I opened the old unit up to find out why it was making such big vibration and noise. I thought there might be a stuck wood chip from my yard. Instead I found serious design issues that make it NOT TO LAST and prone to inconsistent quality. 1. Although the main chamber and grinding elements are made of stainless steel, there is a (non-stainless) steel piece attached to the underside of the bottom of the chamber (that spins). That piece will gradually rust out (falling apart after six years in my unit). Besides, there is no provision in the design to prevent water and particles from getting into the upper bearing, which also rusts. These are TIMED BOMBS that will bring the machine down after certain time, and that's what happened to my ISE 444 (the rust out). They are things that are very easy to fix, and should have been fixed long time ago since ISE has gone through many years / generations. I can't explain why they were not fixed in the ISE 444 (manufactured in 2005). I guess I will find out in the Evolution Compact after it fails. 2. The two bearings that hold the motor shaft are aligned by a sheet metal body. If the body has a dent or if the machining tolerance is off, the shaft may suffer excessive wear and lose balance. I read that Waste King has a fiber glass body and carries a ten year to lifetime mechanical and corrosion warranty (depending on the model). It appears that Waste King has solutions to address these issues. Too late for me now but I will definitely switch over if this Evolution Compact dies again in a few years.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "All the good things you'll read about this are true. But did you notice that all the reviews that are positive are from recent buyers? Anyone who has had this for a while will tell you the real problems that come about. With MINIMAL use, the turntable is already rusting--which means that in a couple of years, it will be leaking. The rust is also preventing one of the lugs from moving. That is because they are using 400 grade stainless steel, which is not really rust-proof. So they get to say it's stainless, but that does not help you. Just run a search on the type and you will see. They needed a 300 grade one to be fine. But as the other reviewer said, it's designed for obsolescence, even though the motor is really good. After 1 hour of haggling where InSinkErator told me (a) rust is not covered--FALSE: the warranty does not cover \"cosmetic rust\" whatever the hell that means (actually, it means the rust that will emerge during warranty but will make your machine leak just after warranty expires) (b) I would have to pay for installation--FALSE: the warranty gives you IN HOME repair they agreed to send me a new one and to pay for the plumber.

I cannot speak on the long term durability of it because I just got it working yesterday but so far I am very impressed. When the electrician installed it, he had to double check that it was on and working because it is so quiet! You will see in the video; pretty much all you can hear is the water running. I actually did two videos, this one was first and then about 30 min later I did another longer video with LOTS more stuff (smoked sausage w/ skins, grapes, yogurt and rock hard pork chops). I did this video because I had not found any online that show it doing what it claims so here you go! I ground two chicken thighs (bones included) to test their claims. Trust Me; they ARE NOT LYING!! I will admit that after round II, I was running it while washing my hands and it turned off automatically. I was horrified! Turns out, it is smart enough to shut-off when it has overheated instead of simply burning up. The motor was too hot to touch (for more than 2 seconds) so I put ice-cubes down the sink and ran cold water. It sat for an hour or so and then I simply pushed the reset button and it was back to normal! With the 7 year warranty, I was comfortable testing their claims and I am happy. Well worth my money! The electrician, my mom and dad were all in disbelief when they saw this in action. This was my first disposal purchase and installation so I wondered if I needed extra parts ... turns out I only needed the plumber's putty and screwdrivers, so I returned the extra parts I bought at Lowe's.

{"review": "The Insinkerator Evolution Excel is simply the best!!!! This year for Thanksgiving, a guest was helping in the kitchen and put a large amount of potato peels down the disposer. I was concerned because not only was the disposer jammed full of potato peels, but there were a bunch of peels in the sink waiting to be stuffed into the disposer. (This has happened with our old disposer and I got the privilege of trying to unclog a clogged sink - not a fun thing to do with a house full of company). I watched her turn on the disposer and to my amazement they were all disposed of without a jam. At this point the Evolution Excel was worth every penny I paid for it. My only complaint about this disposer is that is almost too quiet. When you turn it on, you can barely hear it run. I have to remind myself to insure it has been turned off because you get a quiet hum when it is running, not like the old disposer that was LOUD.

My wife saw a commercial for the Evolution Excel and wanted one. After doing research on its performance, I found it for $249.00 at Home Depot. Reports of its quietness are not exaggerated. This is the quietest disposer I have barely heard! Performance has been outstanding. I ground up a pineapple top just to see if it lived up to the hype - I was amazed. Shortly after I installed it, I tried to install my old disposer in a small kitchen at my church only to find that the drain was too high. The old unit at church was a Insinkerator that had been giving trouble for years - frequent clogs, blown fuses, etc. As facilities manager, I had to replace the old unit. While I am very conscious of saving money (my reason for donating my old unit) I also believe that buying cheap is false economy. I was able to find the same deal at another Home Depot. In our area Home Depot is no longer going to carry this model in the stores, but it is worth paying full price. Drain matched perfectly. I expect calls to clear clogs will be history. Word of caution. You will need another person to hold down the flange in order to secure it to the sink. This unit is heavier and larger than most other units. I struggled with the first unit until I got the jack from my Toyota truck. At 65 I no longer have the arm strength to hold the unit up and fasten the bayonet latch at the same time. The second unit was a breeze to install. Make sure you save the power cord and cord clamp from your old unit or buy a replacement.

{"review": "I am a Mechanical engineer and I also love to cook and have large dinners once a week.I was forced to do a ton of research on disposer's when I had the kitchen done.In the 70s and 80s everybody made there own disposer's and they are better than what you can get today.Kitchenaid,Maytag's,and old Wastekings were the best you could buy.K-Aid disposer's were 40 pounds of Cast steel alloys and they had undercutters on them back then.All of the above brands hand undercutting blades that after the waste is ground and goes in the drain chamber it is cut again by shear like blades.The grind rings on Disposers do the work ,disposers don't have blades in them except old Wastekings they have a center ripper blade in them.Disposer's grind the food by slinging it against the sides were there is a chez grater ring the surrounds the flywheel, the things you see are impellers they push the food around and around.In-Sink-erators were at one point and still are (badger) the worst at grinding and the sad thing is there used to be nothing differnt between the badger versions and the 777ss except stainless steel and more power.The grind chambers on Kenmore,Maytag,K-Aid,are all the same every disposer that has that ISE mount is made by them.A Kenmore 1hp is no different than the 1Hp Maytag except the Maytag is 300 and the Kenmore is 150.I needed a new disposer for my prep sink and I love my Viking it is the old Kitchenaid design.Viking bought the rights from Whirlpool and is a great disposer but was 600 bucks in 2004.I went and got the Ise Excel because it has Fixed hammers and swinging and has the most important part undercutters. I can grind cornhusks in my Viking and this excel will also that is a huge problem with all the others out there they cant handle stringy things.I was very leary at first because I am so hard on disposer's I shove steak bones,rib bones,raw bones,paper and all kinds of things down the Viking and it never stops but the excel seems to be just as good so far and it is very quite to the point if you wonder if its on.The Excel has a jam sensor in it that is the cause of the strange pause at first start up and is normal.I thought there was something wrong with it but the flywheel is making sure it the coast is clear or does it need to engage the hammer and reverse fuction.If you have problems with your disposer stopping up then you cant go wrong with this one or if you hate hearing or worrying about will it grind then you cant go wrong with this one.I have ground everything in mine and never a problem.I was wondering when I.S.E. would wake up and make a good disposer,Wasteking is the only other different brand and there not Wastekings if you ask me.Sinkmaster bought them out and they use that same motor and grind setup and took the good Wasteking design a made them cost thousands as commercial disposer's.The Wastekings motor's are loud and the hammers click like crazy and drive me nuts and there all plastic made in China now so I prefer to buy American made products.Sorry about my grammer folks,I am gifted in Math and Science but grammer I just never could grasp and hated it.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Received this product yesterday. Used to have a Badger5 1/2 hp. It only lasted 6 years as the starter capacitor blew out. After researching for one, I decided on this model. As Tim Allen would say..\"More power!\" This disposal is beastly. After installation, which took about 30-40 minutes, I dropped in 3 good, sized limes at once to see what this unit can do and it didn't even blink. Chewed them up fast and it was very quiet to boot. Next I found a past its prime avacado in the fridge. I cut it open, put in the two halfs with skin and.... Gone! Hell, I even threw in the pit. Of course going against conventional wisdom of \"you can't put that in there\" but with this unit you can and a hell of alot more. After some \"convincing\" by the disposal, the pit was destroyed all while using its inside voice. I loved it! Other reviews on here mention that it's hard to tell when the unit is on. They're right. It's whisper quiet and you'll be pleasently surprised at just how. One note that I must point out that I have NOT seen in any other of the reviews on here. When this unit is turned on you might notice a 1/2 second hum or delay before it actually starts to turn. THIS IS NORMAL. When I noticed this, I searched online and found that others were having this \"issue\" but one owner posted his email that he got from Insinkerator with this question and their statement was this: \"Thank you for writing InSinkErator. We understand that your disposer does not start automatically and initially makes a low electric hum upon activation. We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused. If the Evolution Excel is powered on, one may experience a brief 1/2 second delay before the disposer starts. This delay is a result of the time it takes to power-up the microprocessor in the Jam-Sensor circuit, and a momentary buzz or hum may be audible during the power-up sequence. The delay and hum are completely normal. We hope this helps.\" And I also, hope this helps. So, if you are in the market for a new disposal, or just simply looking to upgrade, BUY THIS UNIT! The disposal is more than the others out there, but when you consider construction, power and decible level, the pros far outweigh any cons. And I can't think of ANY.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "We just had our new disposal installed and we are absolutely amazed at how quiet and smooth it is. We had it installed with a 604 stainless steel Blanco sink and quartz counter tops. The 604 stainless sink is much heavier and thicker than our previous sink and the quartz tops are also much heavier than our previous laminate tops so this may help some as well to dampen the sound but I think most of the credit has to go to Insinkerator. What ever they did to make this quiet definitely paid off. No more rattling and shaking of the counter and sink. Don't even consider a lesser model. We paid $249.95 through Amazon plus $17.29 shipping.", "id": "680343011"}

The new baffle design is supposed to be an improvement but I think it is a giant leap backwards .In a complaint directly to the manufacturer , they said there is no alternate baffle available .I don't know if the lesser models now have the same baffle , but if they do , I surely will not buy another Insinkerator .", "id": "680343011"}

{"review": "It took me about 45 minutes to install my new insinkerator that I purchased from Amazon. I'm no plumber yet found this pretty simple. It's a little heavy, but most able bodied individuals can install this without any help. The only thing I had to buy that wasn't in the box was plumbers putty and a cable connector for the electrical. I couldn't find anything to \"dispose of\" to truely test it out except for a 6 month old rock hard lime. Needless to say the new disposal didn't even flinch as it quietly obliterated the lime. I am certain that thing would still be clanking around inside my old POS Kenmore. I am thrilled with this product so far. Good price on Amazon compared to Lowes as well--", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I bought this to replace 20 year old ISE disposer which lost both of its blades and was pretty much useless. Installation was almost plug-and-play except for the sink flange piece. I had to remove old one (couple of minutes), clean some old plumber's putty and make sure contact surface is clean before I put the new one on. Since I have stainless steel sink, the supplied rubber gasket was just fine to use alone. The outlet orientation and dishwasher inlet were in exact same spot as the previous disposer so I didn't have to mock around with that - perfect compatibility. Last was electrical hook up. The disposer comes with around 2-3 feet of cable with standard 3 prong plug on one end... I had to cut it off and make electrical connection to old cable. Manual covers that and tells exactly which prong should be hooked up to which color of wire on the other cable. Similarly to plumber's putty, there were no wire caps included with the disposer. At this point I was finished so I decided to test the efficiency of this disposer... I took all the bits and pieces of food (nut shells, carrots, etc, stuff that old broken disposer could not chew), almost full chamber of it and stuffed it into the new disposer... It chewed thru all of it in about 10s, truly amazing. No wonder since this disposer spins at 2600 rpms which is something like 2x as fast than usual disposer in its class. It is also VERY quiet. When operating in normal fashion (not full chamber of hard stuff at once), you won't even notice much more noise when throwing stuff inside since the food gets chewed into little pieces immediately and has no time to bounce around the chamber generating noise and vibrations for sink to amplify. The disposer comes with removable splash guard that sits about 2 inches below sink line inside of the flange. It also comes with sink plug, you insert it inside the flange. It is a very effective plug too. I think this is the best bang for the bucks these days since for one, it is all stainless steel blades and chamber walls secondly it comes with 5 year in home warranty and life time rust warranty. For comparison, I went to Lowes/HD and what did I find for this price? The cheapest they had was ISE Badger 1 which was actually $76 + tax. That one is noisy as hell, has galvanized steel parts (will rust in couple of years) and very short warranty...", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Like several of the other reviewers, I purchased this to replace a Badger 5. I found the Waste King product impressive on a number of areas. The warranty is five years and it includes in-home service, which is a rarity nowadays. Some of the larger Waste King models (1 Hp) have a lifetime in-home warranty. I looked at them, but decided to go with the ½ HP version since I only use the disposal for plate scrapings (bones go in the trash and vegetable peelings go into the compost pile) and didn't want to buy way more disposal than I needed. Waste King offers two mounting options - the traditional three bolt method, and the EZ method. This model is the EZ method and, true to its name, is really easy! Very clear instructions come with the unit, plus there are videos on the Waste King site to walk you through the process. If you have even the most basic of tool skills and can follow instructions, this is a job you can handle. The other feature I liked about the EZ mount option was that the rubber guard (the piece of rubber at the top of the opening that you push scraps through) is removable for cleaning. It is not removable in the 3 bolt mounting option and, considering how horrible the one looked in my Badger after a few years, I wanted something that I could take out and clean (or replace). But, all the parts in the 3 bolt option are stainless steel, whereas there are plastic parts in the EZ mount option. The plastic seems sturdy enough, so I hope it will last a long time. I'm especially pleased to report that Waste King has outstanding customer service. I emailed them some questions before I ordered, and they replied in a few hours, and answered all my questions in full (versus just those canned boilerplate responses you sometimes get from companies). After it arrived I had a question regarding if the sink flange (the part you see when you look into the sink) was plastic or stainless. So I called them and got an answer very quickly (it is stainless). Very pleasant phone call, and minimal (3 or 4 min) hold time. Product works great. It runs faster (higher RPM) than the Badger, so it grinds quicker. Not as ultra quiet as the really high end ones, but less noise than the Badger. It has stainless cutters which should outlast the galvanized ones in the Badger by a long time. Works well, easy to install, great warranty, excellent customer support, great price. What more could you want!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Like the other reviewer I replaced an older one with this. The trick is that older garbage disposals tend to have something called a three-point attachment just under the sink, while newer ones like this have a new design that rotates on. Now if you want to replace the current part that's in the sink this doesn't matter. But then you need the plumber's putty like the other reviewer said (unless it's a stainless steel sink, whose smooth surface apparently doesn't leak). On the other hand you can do what I did and buy an adapter. This mounted under the sink, allowing me to keep the part you see in the sink when you look down, and thereby obviating the need for applying plumber's putty. It cost about $15 at Orchard Supply, but I'm sure you can get one from Amazon. It bolted to the sink part easily, and the Waste King rotated onto the adapter equally easily. The only problem was that the adapter lowered the garbage disposal itself half an inch or so. I wound up going to Home Depot and rummaging around in their disordered bins until I found the pieces of piping I needed. It was a snap to install them once I got home, though. Plastic piping has become so standard, and works so well, it's hard to remember the old days when you needed plumber's putty for everything. Now the installation under the sink looks professional, I've upgraded from a 1/3 to a 1/2 hp. motor, it's quieter (and mostly plastic, as the other reviewer said). This came with a 5 year warranty, and if I'd bought a more expensive Waste King I could have gotten a one-owner lifetime warranty. But this seemed good enough. And it was a much longer warranty than the comparable Kenmore unit. It also came with a power cord built in. Didn't have to wire up anything. I'd say, in general, that plumbing has become much easier for do-it-yourselfers. So if you're hesitating, I recommend going for it.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I replaced my InSinkErator (ISE) Badger 5 which started leaking after only a few years and was already out of warranty. I read a lot of generally negative reviews of ISE products so when I ran across this model and read the positive feedback I decided to give it a try and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. For what I paid ($75) the Waste King L-2600 came with everything I needed to replace my ISE in the box with the exception of plumber's putty which you must use if your sink is not stainless steel but this is reasonable. I have a non-stainless steel sink so I could not use the included rubber gasket but putty works just as well maybe adds an extra 5 minutes to installation. It also comes with a 3-prong cord which will plug into any outlet no fancy wiring needed which saved me time. Compare that to the ISE Badger 5 which costs more and they charge an extra $10 on top of that to get the 3-prong adapter kit so the Waste King was a better deal for me. I removed my old ISE and replaced it with this one on a Saturday afternoon with time to spare. Included instructions are adequate but be sure to read all the steps, especially if you have a dishwasher since you need to punch out the plug BEFORE you install the unit. This was my first time replacing a garbage disposal and I can attest to the ease of installation. As with other reviewers I found the unit to be quiet, fast, maybe too quiet. I'm so use to the loud roar of the ISE that the quiet buzz of this unit may make you think it's not working on but rest assured it works fine and handles everything we throw at it within reason. Also a 5 year in home warranty beats the competition as well. The only negative I can think of is that this unit is made in China while the ISE is made in the USA. As much as I would like to support ISE their shoddy quality and cheap warranty were deal breakers for me. I highly recommend the Waste King L-2600.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I bought this unit from Amazon for $75. It replaced my \"insinkerator badger 5\" food disposer which began to leak water from the unit's bottom where the outlet cord goes in. It lasted 4 1/2 years. Installation of the Waste King was simple and straightforward. However, a couple of things to note. This disposer is noisier than the insinkerator that I replaced. Also, the intake diameter of this Waste King model is smaller than the insinkerator model. And, an important installation tip: Remember to knock out the plug on the disposer for the dishwasher hose!! I didn't read the instructions carefully and after installing this disposer, our dishwasher stopped draining after a wash. Called repairman; after five minutes he pulled out a white plug from the dishwasher intake hole. That cost me $75 for that simple diagnosis and fix... all because I didn't read the instructions carefully!!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "The installation was very easy for someone who has not done this sort of thing before. Saves about $150-$200 (plumbers quoted rate for disposal installation). The manual was detailed. I didn't have to look at web videos. Just spent 10 - 15 minutes skimming thru the manual. Removed the old Badger 5 - removing it was the difficult part. The installer of the Badger 5 had put glue and sealed the connection between the black elbow/bend pipe connector and the home 1 1/2\" drain. So I had to cut just under the joint and remove the older black elbow/bend connector. Also the thin ring on the 3-bolt system was a bit tough to get off - had to use a strong screwdriver to push it down and out from the top - a difficult angle on something that is so close to the sink. My sink is stainless steel so used the seal that came with the Waste King. The Waste king comes with the black 1 1/4\" elbow connector. Followed directions to first install the EZ mount on the stainless sink and test the seal by putting the stopper and half filling sink and letting stand for 3-4 minutes. Left the water in the sink for the duration of the install so that if any installation step causes seal break it will be known immediately. Then I rushed to home depot to get the 1 1/2\" to 1 1/4\" reducer PVC connector (which I had had to cut off when I removed the Badger) and using glue connected it to the previously cut pipe - the plumbers glue has toxic fumes so make sure to properly ventilate if using the plumbers glue - horrible substance - glad I had to use it only once. Since I had made the cut very close, I did not need to patch the pipe with a union. Since PVC is a bit flexible when it comes to moving things around(as compared to metal pipes), I was able to slip the waste king black elbow into the PVC reducer connection and secure the connection with the screw type flange. For electrical, if you are replacing a disposal that is directly connected to the home wiring without a wall outlet, then I would recommend the purchase of this part: Leviton 000-515CR-000 (15 Amp Rubber Grounding Plug, Black, also available in Vinyl for $4 - recommend the rubber version) - this is available on Amazon as well as in Home Depot/Lowes. It is only about $5 and saves having to cut or undo the three-prong plug on the waste king. You insert and affix your home wiring into this connector (of course after following necessary precaution of shutting off breaker). Then you plug the waste king into the other end of this which has a three prong female connector. All the hammering to move the notch to the extreme left (as mentioned in the install guide) had caused the whole assembly to move a bit off the center when seen from the sink. But this was not something to worry. Gripping the Waste King with both hands, I was able to slide the whole assembly to a centered position without having to redo everything and the seal was still water tight. The noise was much less than the badger. Every time you start it up, it has a little metallic click which can be especially heard if you do not have the strainer on. Initially I was a bit unsure if mine was defective, but then I RTFM where it was mentioned that this is normal. Start time (start of opening the box and starting to read manual): 8:45 PM, end time 2 AM. In between took about 1.5 hour break to run to home depot as well as get dinner. I will update review with actual usage experience as well as long term performance in a few months. Result is not just that I saved money on the installation, but now feel confident to do a lot of minor plumbing tasks. Considered new ISE low noise products before buying this, but didn't really feel that the trade off of noise to price was worth paying $100 plus. After all the disposal is used only once or twice a day for a few minutes and a 10-20% louder noise during these times is perfectly acceptable - this one does have good noise reduction though when compared to the badgers. Would have been nice if Waste King had included the Leviton electrical connector as well as the PVC reducer in the package for upgraders, but for price that's expecting too much I guess.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Like darned near every other reviewer here, I purchased this to replace a heavy, noisy, and leaking InSinkErator Badger 5. That unit only lasted three years before it started leaking. VERY disappointing! So I got on Amazon, like you probably are right now, trying to find a solution. Well...you are DONE looking...just order this thing. It's true what you've been reading everywhere else, this unit is a 100% direct-replace for a Badger 5. The outlet and the dishwasher hose mounts are the exact same as that of the Badger in all respects. I just now finished the install, and it was a piece of cake. Although this unit is made in China, the instructions were not written in the broken, cryptic language of instructions to some of the other products made there. The installation was clearly spelled out with great illustrations. A rookie could easily install this. The mounting system that comes on this unit is FAR superior to the clamp that was on my old one. No tools are required to mount this to your sink bottom, and it installs with no need for plumber's putty (IF you have a stainless steel sink). If you're doing a replacement everything you need to install this is in the box. Out with the old and in with the new was a 15 minute job, and I could have probably done it in 5 if someone put a wager on it. :) My wife and I were both impressed with how quiet this was, as we ground up a few miscellaneous food scraps. I like the fact that it's plastic and won't suffer the same corroded fate as the galvanized steel Badger which is now rightfully buried in my trash can.

{"review": "Replaced an old Insinknerator that had a cracked casing. Pros: -Quiet but I really don't think this is because of sound insulation, I think it is just a quiet motor with good bearings. (see cons below) -Inexpensive -If you are mechanically inclined enough to use a screwdriver and know how to read, you can install it yourself. -Does what it's supposed to Cons: -The outside shell is only two pieces of flimsy plastic (one on top, one on bottom) that were screwed together to make the disposer look bigger than it actually is. I thought this L-2600 looked bigger than the L-1001 because of the sound insulation mentioned in the specs but either there is no real sound insulation or they forgot to put it in mine. There is just a whole lot of empty space in between the casing and the actual disposer itself. If they had made the casing to fit this disposer just right then it would look like the skinny Waste Maid 58. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for this. Basically they wasted my cabinet space just so that they could make it look more heavy duty.

{"review": "I bought the Waste King L-2600 1/2 hp disposer to replace an old Whirlaway 1/3 hp (which is made by the same company) that had broken after many years of use. The L-2600 is an upgrade and was an easy replacement, since it uses the same mounting system as the Whirlaway. In fact, I just re-used the existing sink flange and support ring/mount ring hardware already installed on the sink, and the new L-2600 fit right on (it uses a \"bayonet-style\" mounting system, so all you do is turn a locking ring to mount it). I'll save the newer sink-mount components for use with a new replacement sink I intend to buy later. The price of the L-2600 from Amazon was right for my purpose, and free shipping was fast enough. The power difference between 1/3 hp (the original) and 1/2 (the L-2600) is not really significant, but this one comes with a stainless steel turntable (the part that rotates at high speed) and stainless steel pulverizing (swivel impeller) hammers, which is an upgrade from the Whirlaway. Although this unit has a plastic outer housing that is supposedly noise-insulated (it says-so right on the box), I really could not discern a difference from the non-insulated Whirlaway it replaced. In any case, I use it only occasionally and it only runs for a short time, so the noise is not an issue for me (for comparison, a slightly higher-priced Insinkerator brand that I installed for my parents 2 years ago is noticeably quieter, but would have been too large to fit the space I had). Waste King does make more expensive versions with higher power and better noise insulation, if that's important to you, but they are also physically bigger. As far as performance, it seems to work well enough for my purposes (mostly plate scrapings, vegetable peels, etc; no large bones or other really hard-to-grind items). It is not commercial quality, but for that you would probably have to pay hundreds more. I have been using it for a little over a month now, and have had no issues with it. This unit comes with a power cord and 120-volt household plug, for use with a typical under-sink switched outlet, but the cord can be removed if you need to hard-wire it to a junction box. Drain pipe connection is standard for home-use disposers (plastic tail-piece), from what I have seen, and it can take a dishwasher drain connection (you have to remove a simple plastic plug).", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "Very easy installation, (taking the old one out was the hardest part), is fairly quiet and seems powerful. Of course most of it is plastic where the 18 year old In-sink-erator it replaced was almost all steel. One thing I really liked is the easily removable splash guard. One thing I didn't like is if your sink isn't stainless steel, you'll be running to the hardware store in the middle of the installation for some plumber's putty. For a couple of pennies, they could have included in the install kit a small rope of plumber's putty for the sink flange. I hope it lasts at least half as long as the old In-sink-erator did! P.S. I always feel good buying from Amazon. They're one of the best internet dealers period. I received this disposal in just 2 days after ordering!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I recently purchased one of these and am pleased with the power, capacity, versatility, and especially the quiet operation. However, the installation was more than i had anticipated. Assuming that you are replacing another disposer that is more than a few years old, you should be prepared to replace much of the surrounding hardware including the dishwasher anti-siphon valve, hose, and clamps. This disposer does not come with a power cord and the instructions direct you to use the one from your old unit. In fact, you will probably need to buy a new cord made specifically for the ISE, especially if your old disposer is another make; ISE's have a special strain-relief clamp which will prevent the cord from being yanked out. While you're under the sink you may as well check for leaks, replace the contact paper and patch any drywall knocks that have happened over the years. The real gotcha with the Evolution Series is that it's wider than most other models, which means that you'll probably need to cut and realign PVC drain pipes to make it fit. For me this involved 3-dimensional measurements, trigonometry, and second-guessing about why somebody before me installed drain pipe that way in the first place. The wider body of the Evolution also means you will have less under-sink storage space available, which might be the difference between keeping a trash container down there or not. ISE also makes a lower-capacity Evolution model that is just as powerful and has dimensions more similar to their Badger line. If i had it to do again, i would have gotten the smaller one instead and hopefully avoided the PVC work. Still, this is a great disposer now that it's in place.", "id": "680343011"}

The only customization I had to do was trim down an existing piece of PVC pipe and refit it under my sink. Trust me, this part only took about 5 minutes to do. These are very easy and straightforward to install. The InSinkErator itself works like a champ. It runs very quiet and smoot. Hardly know it's on at all.

It is quite a bit wider than the old one but most of the difference in size is at the top so it doesn't take up extra usable space. At least not under my sink. My husband installed it and said it was easy to put in. The electric cord is not supplied so he used the one from the old (3-year) disposer.

{"review": "Every house I have lived in had a cheap disposal that wouldn't grind for squat. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables so I have a lot of organic matter to put down the disposal, it's an appliance I use on almost a daily basis. I have a Badger 1 and it's crap. It does not grind lemon or lime peels, even after several minutes of the disposal running. It is so loud and noisy it scares the cats into the bedroom to hide under the bed, it sounds like a 747 taking off in the kitchen. And it vibrates so much I fear the countertop is going to come off the cabinets, many times it has caused the the soap dish to bounce into the sink and almost get chewed up in the disposal. Luckily I've learned when to catch it in time. I decided it was time to upgrade to something decent. I stayed with Insinkerator because of the easy mount system, they are interchangable so installation is faster. My local Lowe's had a demo stand that allowed you to hear the noise level of the Badger 1, Evolution Essential and the Excel. Wow, it sure was tempting to shell out the extra $100 for the Excel, it was whisper quiet! But I am VERY happy with the Evolution I purchased. It took me about an hour to install, and I am a single female who has never done any plumbing work. It is kind of heavy to lift up and rotate into the mount, you just have to find a way to brace your arms against your body for extra support and strength. Luckily I did not have to re-cut any pipe. If you are upgrading from a Badger, everything is in the same position so it makes re-attaching the pipes easy. After I turned it on for the first time I was jumping for joy! This thing is great! It chewed up lemon and lime peels in a second. I couldn't believe how fast it grinds, 1 or 2 seconds and it's gone. It is MUCH quieter than the Badger. I'm glad I didn't get the Excel for only the quieter sound, the Essential is plenty quiet. And the best part, the anti-vibration mount doesn't rattle a thing! No more countertop rattle and no more soap dish bouncing into the sink. I could not have been happier with my purchase. I will never live with another Badger again!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I don't know from garbage disposals--bought this one based on reviews when our other disposal went out after ten years. I was able to install it into the existing sink-ring in less than an hour (the real time drain was getting myself positioned under the sink to work effectively--it had nothing to do with the disposal itself). When we first turned it on, my wife and I were a bit startled, as we didn't hear anything and figured something was wrong. Nothing was wrong, the machine was just several decibels quieter than our old disposal. In fact, we need to listen hard to hear it running when we turn it on. Plus, there is virtually no vibration, which had not been the case with our old disposal. This new InSinkerator has been in operation for about a month, and I couldn't imagine a single negative thing to say about it. While I was annoyed to have to research and install a new disposal (it's not like anyone's to-do list needs something extra like \"buy and install new garbage disposal\" heaped on top), I'm actually glad the old unit died.

Although not especially loud, you could tell by the sound when the food was ground up - and it was ground up in seconds. The Evolution Essential takes about three times as long, and I am always removing the black-thingy to peek inside to see if it is finished. It seldom is. Plus, the black-thingy keeps water from draining quickly, so if you pour a big pot of boiling spaghetti-water into a collander, you get a sink-full of boiling water and a steam burn.

Careful though that you make sure you identify the positive and negative hook-up on the existing unit before cutting the cables. My existing power cable did not identify the +/- so I had to mark which wires were connected to the units +/- prior to removing so I could reconnect with the new one properly. The unit is VERY quiet. I tossed a few things down there and I thought the thing wasn't even working at first. I put half an apple down there and it was practically silent. Nice work! Anyway, highly recommend. Hopefully this unit lasts longer than my previos InSinkErator which was the Badger 5 I think - it's the $99 unit that the builders put into my house and we're not sure what happened to it.

{"review": "I purchased our new home about 5 years ago, and it came with a ISE cheap entry level disposal. It would no longer spin. Researching, I found this one, purchased it, and installed it myself. Another reason, whether it makes a difference or not, that I selected the same manufacturer, is my thoughts that the same positioning of the holes to adapt he pipes should be he same. Thus making my installation easier. I could not be more pleased. This unit is seriously quieter than the unit that was in my new home. It is a lot larger, but this presented no clearance or installation issues. Installation was very simple. It did require cutting to length the included plastic pipe, which took about a minute with a hacksaw blade. I did transfer the electrical plug from the old unit to the new unit without a hitch. I also had to get a small tube of plumbers putty to seal the drain at the bottom of the sink. All units require it. So it was no surprise at all. I think I spent under $5. I had to go to the store to get the appropriate wire connectors (2) but any excuse to go to the hardware store is good for me!! The tools required were minimal, and the instructions were very easy to follow. I was also able to register it on line. It does come with a very long warranty, which is one of the reasons I bought it. I would recommend this unit for being so quiet, great warranty, and easiness in installation, and great warranty", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "This is so much quieter than my builder grade InSInkerator. A couple of notes: I had a cheap, thin stainless steel sink, and the cheaper disposal was loud, and the entire sink shook. If my countertops were not granite, I think the entire cabinet would have shook. But when the old one ran, the faucet shook back and forth it had such a vibration. THis new one is quiet, and there is no noticeable vibration, although I upgraded my sink to a granite composite, so that helps as well. It is not silent, but you can at least hold a conversation, or hear the TV while it is running. And I think you want some noise so that you remember it is on, and don't inadvertantly stick something in the sink while it's running. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that when I put lemon peels in it, I still have one small piece left in the sink after running it. It is always about the size of a nickel, but it makes a louder noise when that piece is in there, and I physically remove it, and then it is whisper quiet again. With the old, cheap Insinkerator, I rarely had any pieces of food left in it. But this only happens with lemon peels. It is still a good product, and the quietness is worth the price to upgrade.", "id": "680343011"}

{"review": "I completely agree with the review by Ronald Linch. I replaced my old Insinkerator Badger disposal (piece of junk, sprang a leak after only 3 1/2 years) with a new Waste King L-8000. This adapter let me easily attach the new disposal, which uses the EZ mount, to the Badger's 3 bolt mount, which was already attached to the sink. I think the negative reviews come from people not understanding when this adapter is needed and when it is not. I will try to make that clear: If your new disposal uses a 3 bolt mount, you can't use this adapter. If your new disposal uses EZ mount and you plan to remove the old 3 bolt mount, or you are attaching to a sink without an old disposal, you don't need this adapter since the new disposal should come with a complete set of EZ mount hardware. If your new disposal uses EZ mount and you already have a 3 bolt mount installed in your sink drain (from an old disposal), this adapter will save you the work of removing it and installing the new EZ mount hardware. If your new disposal uses EZ mount and you already have an EZ mount installed, you don't need this adapter.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "There seems to be so much confusion and misleading reviews about this adaptor and the different mounting systems. If you purchase one of the the Waste King EZ Mount disposers, a new mounting kit is supplied in the box. Yes, you can try to save time by paying $10 for this adaptor kit, but why? First, most disposers are available with both mounting systems. I purchased the Waste King L-8000 which uses an EZ Mount, but I could have just as easily purchased the L-9980. The latter is basically the same 1.0-horsepower unit but with a 3-bolt system. Understandably, this doesn't help if you've already made your purchase and were unaware of the difference, but it's still not going to save time by using the kit with your existing 3-bolt mount. If you have not purchased a disposer yet, purchasing this adaptor with an EZ Mount doesn't make much sense at all. Installation - It most cases is it NOT easier to install the EZ Mount with a kit. The discharge/output port is a standard height on most brand disposers. That means the new unit should line up perfectly with your existing pipes, unless you use an adaptor. The adaptor will lower the unit. You may be able to tilt the pipes down to line up, but it most cases you will need to purchase new pipes (and a hacksaw if you don't have one). I cannot see any circumstance where this would be easier than replacing the old 3-bolt and flange. Removing the old 3-bolt is not hard, I cannot emphasize this enough. You take a screwdriver and loosen the three bolts. There is a clamp ring at the base of the flange that can be easily popped off with a flathead screwdriver or pliers. Once the clamp ring is removed, gravity will remove the assembly and the flange can be pulled right out of the sink. Even with hardened plumbers putty, it will pull right out. No problem. That's it! After that the EZ mount will install literally in about 5 minutes or less. If you have to re-align your pipes there is absoutely no way you are going to save time or money. The only circumstance where I can see people needing this adaptor is if they unknowingly purcheased an EZ Mount disposer over a similar model with a 3-bolt...and are either 1. picky about how the flange looks in the sink, or 2) do not like the slightly smaller diameter splash guard. In the case of the flange, you can still order specialty flanges in different colors and looks, but at a cost. To keep your original flange you would need the kit. But again, that is only if one unknowningly purchased an EZ Mount when a similar 3-bolt is available, and your objection is the look or style of the flange or splash guard, NOT functionality. Otherwise there is virtually no circumstance where you need this adaptor, or can use it to save time regardless of which disposer your purchased. My advice, just pick a disposer with the mounting system you prefer. For me it doesn't matter because I would always prefer to replace the old mounting system with the new one in the box.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I recently bought a Waste King L-8000 disposal (featuring the EZ mount system) to replace a Badger 1 disposal (featuring the 3-bolt mount system). Whichever system your sink currently utilizes is probably the system you want to keep rolling with, trust me! The #3101 kit is very simple... it literally contains just the two pieces you see in the photograph. All you do is swap out two pieces that came with your EZ mount disposal with these two pieces. You will then be able to connect your new EZ mount disposal to a sink that contains 3-bolt mount hardware. On a scale of 1-10, I would say that the difficulty factor is a 1 or 2.

{"review": "I utilized another reviewer's feedback in order to confirm I did indeed need this adapter: I was planning to leave the existing 3-mount of the old disposer (Badger 1) and use this adapter with a new EZ-Mount (Waste King 8000). The removal of the old disposer and modification/installation of the mount with this adapter went smoothly and was very simple; HOWEVER, once in place I could see there would be a drain issue unless the plumbing connecting to the other sink & trap were modified (lengthened & lowered). Leaving the 3-mount and adding the adapter effectively lowered the drain outlet from the disposer placing it lower than my existing drain connections, meaning gravity would not work in my favor. I opted to install the disposer without the adapter and removed the original 3-mount assembly from the old disposer.

However, the kit sets the Waste King discharge line lower than where it was in your old disposal. This change in elevation requires additional plumbing work that isn't needed if you would just use the kit that comes with the Waste King disposal.

That my issues were with water, not the tank. Considering that I added this disposer shortly after the last pumping with zero impact to the septic system/tank tells me that it works.

{"review": "This is the 2nd disposal that I have installed. Our old house was on county sewer, so we did not need the added benefits of the Septic Assist. It was much more difficult to install than the new one. The box includes nearly everything you need to install it. The only other things you need to have on hand is the plumber's putty to seal the flange in the sink, and some romex to attach the power. I did the job solo, but it would have been helpful to have another pair of hands to hold the drain in the sink while I cliped on the locking ring. Now that InSinkErator has the removable rubber seal that slips into the drain from the top, mounting the unit to the twist lock under the sink was a breeze. Since the power was already run to an outlet under the sink, I had this installed in under an hour. I don't know how long the bottle of Septic Assist will last, but we have used it for a week without a noticable lowering of the contents of the bottle. Running the unit is much quieter than the old ones. It's not silent, but the combination of vibration dampers and insulated chassis makes it quiet enough to talk over. It's more of a hum than a roar. All in all, a relief to have a disposal again at the new house. Of course, only time will tell what impact it will have when we need to get the septic pumped.

{"review": "I'm really glad to finally have a disposal for this house that is on septic. No matter how diligent we were, some food particles always ended up in the sink and periodically caused drain line problems. Installation was straight forward even though I did not have an existing disposal to replace. My two biggest challenges were getting an electric outlet under the sink and removing the old corroded sink flange. For electric I mounted a GFCI outlet under the sink and added the optional power cord kit and sink top switch. This eliminated the need to add a wall switch since I did not have an existing disposal. To remove the corroded flange (5 minutes max) I used a moto-tool with cutting wheel - I was working solo and didn't have anyone to help me muscle the old nut and flange apart - it just kept spinning in the sink. As mentioned elsewhere the only other thing I needed to purchase was plumbers putty, and I bought a new hole saw for my drill to drill through the solid surface countertop for the sink top switch. Under the sink I was able to reuse all of the existing PVC plumbing where new parts weren't provided. After a month of occasional use the Septic Assist bottle is still 7/8 full. I will still maintain the septic system with pumping every 2-3 years but I'm hoping this helps with the drain line issues inside the house. It is much quieter than I expected and the sink top switch works great. I couldn't be more pleased with this product.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "This is my first product review. We had to replace our garbage disposal after 10 years in service so I checked here at Amazon for options. I happened on to the Evolution Septic Asist unit that is touted as very quiet. Since we live in a rural environment and use a septic system, I felt this might be a unit to investigate further. After looking at the reivews, I decided to order the unit. Shipping was fine and arrived in good shape. After removing the unit from the box, I then became aware of how large this unit is. It's big. And this is something you will want to be aware of and plan for. Due to its size, we had to re-plumb some of the drains below the sink so the unit will fit. It had to be timed and placed in a less than favorable position but it will work. Be sure you have adequate room under your sink before ordering the unit so as not to cause unnecessary work when installing. Having it finally in place, the unit performs wonderfully.

The originally-installed disposals, as well as the first replacement model I purchased, were noisemakers, to be run only when you don't need to hear the TV sound in the next room. They also were not particularly effective, as I still got plugged drains from coarsely-ground food scraps. The Waste King L-3300 is much quieter and really pulverizes those scraps. Plus, the installation was much easier than the three-screw mounting system that seems to be the norm for other models. Make no mistake, this is a heavy unit and it is non-trivial to hold it up to the mounting flange while you twist the mounting collar to complete the installation, but it only takes a few minutes for that step, and a burly helpful neighbor or husband will suffice.

{"review": "Length:: 4:27 Mins Honestly, I got tired of a lot of people slamming this product and saying it was a terrible mounting system and that they couldn't get the garbage disposal in because it was too tight... whine, whine, whine! It is a very easy system if you know what you're doing. Sometimes a video works wonders compared to directions and a diagram. I hope this is the case and that it will assist others in using the EZ mount system and not getting frustrated or wasting time. I hope this helps someone and encourages others to get the product. I think it is a great product and many of the poor reviews are because people didn't know how to use the mounting system. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have any tips in trouble shooting for when it leaks out the bottom. It should at least say to look at the drain hose and that it may be leaking inside from there and only appear to be leaking from the bottom. I also think Waste King should have made a video to show the EZ mount system. I mean it took me less than 10min. to do it all. Lastly, I don't like the click it can make when it turns on. While lots of people mention this and the directions say it's normal it is not \"standard\" in the garbage disposal business, meaning most don't make this noise. It can be startling and sound like something metal is in your disposal. While it is normal for their units, I still don't like it. It will take getting used to and then what if something metal is in my disposal will I think there isn't and that it's the click.

{"review": "I looked around on line for a week to find the best garbage disposal for around $100. I paid $115 at Amazon. As near as I can tell this is the same unit that Consumer Reports rated very well in a review I read from 2009. Amazon reviewers rated it well also. Small throat I was concerned that one reviewer mentioned the small opening in the throat of the disposal and how that impedes reaching one's hand in to get something out. With the rubber flange, reaching a hand is pretty simple, and I have huge palms. With the flange in, neither my nor my wife's hands fit. The flange is easily removed, if necessary, and if something really important is in there (say, a wedding ring), it will take hardly any time at all to pop the disposal off from the bottom if taking the flange out doesn't work. Others will point out that there are always tongs, which are safer. With the flange in, however, this would be difficult as well. So, if you buy this, plan on taking out the flange if you need to retrieve anything in there. Of course, the flange will prevent most things from going down, so it most likely won't be necessary. Power cord I was also concerned that the unit came with a plug-type power cord already attached. My old unit was hard-wired. Another reviewer remarked that it is really difficult to remove the plug on this unit to do a hard wire installation. I consulted the you-tube experts and some electrician blogs and learned that using a plug is safer anyway, so I mounted a box under my sink. Easy enough. Very Easy Installation I would give this 5 stars for ease of installation and initial quality of unit, however, I have given it 4 stars because the mounting flange assembly seems really cheap. I hope it lasts. Plumber's putty was all I needed to buy for the installation, and unless your under-sink pipes are unique or this is a new installation or if you are replacing a much differently sized disposal, it should be all you need to purchase. The unit is very quiet compared to what we had before and seems to chew everything up so far. It does make a pretty good snap sound when turned on, which at least one reviewer commented on, but we are already used to that. DO NOT fall prey to Amazon's bundle option. As always happens with Amazon, there was a \"buy these three together\" option. Included in the option I got was a flange and stopper, which come standard with the machine, and an adapter to mate the unit to an Insinkerator style sink mount. The adapter is $10. Plumber's putty is $2. Save the $8, unless you really need to keep the flange in your sink now. In other words, both of the bundle options are completely unnecessary.", "id": "680343011"}

And I am so happy with the purchase. It is my opinion that I would like too much power than not enough power and this was a good choice for my household. In my household, it is me and my husband and we do not put a lot down the disposal but do have remnants from dinner and the occasional potato or apple peels.

{"review": "I am a researcher. I read every review - the good and the bad. I've read the Consumer Reports reviews, read the Amazon reviews, read the other, sketchier review websites like GreatGarbageDisposals.com (I made that one up but if you've done any research on the internet you get my point). I am writing this review to share what I learned about the product and about the many reviews I've read. My situation was that our 6 year old Badger froze up and simply quit on me, so a new one was in order. First, is it loud or quiet? It really depends on which review you read, apparently. I believe it depends on more than that, such as what kind of sink is it being installed under - a stainless steel or a porcelain coated cast iron sink? One is very thin and flexible and will not block out as much noise or damp vibrations as effectively as a heavy cast iron sink. I have found the overall noise level to be a lot like the Badger 5 that I replaced. My wife thinks it sounds a bit different but neither louder nor quieter. It also depends on whether this is your first disposer (it is certainly louder than not having one) or a replacement. Bottom line, it's typically run for a few seconds, with the water running too, as you are cleaning up after meal (not in the middle of the night when everyone's trying to sleep) and it's no louder or quieter than the rest. I wouldn't let that be a deciding factor unless you have different criteria. If so, you can pay twice as much for that other \"Elite\" one by another manufacturer that is CR-rated as the quietest one. In my case I couldn't justify the added cost. What's up with that scary loud noise when you turn it on? There are some reviews that make this sound like it is eating a spoon (a LOUD, disturbing, and/or startling snap or click noise, etc.). I have to say that was one of my biggest reservations when I ordered this thing, having read the reviews. A fairly large slice of reviewers commented negatively on it. Here's my take... The motor is 3/4 HP compared to my little dinky 1/3 HP motor on my old one. That is a lot more horsepower and, consequently, a lot more torque. The little \"teeth\" that do the waste grinding that sit in the base of the chamber spin freely. When you turn it on, the little grinders snap into place like how your head gets whipped back on one of those crazy spinning carnival rides. It's just from centrifugal force setting the blades into place. The fine print in the directions tell you that it is part of the anti-jam mechanism. It's not startling or even disconcerting to me or my wife. We didn't blink an eye. I couldn't scare my children by turning it on. It just makes a bit of a click when you turn it on. No biggie. Full disclosure here - ours is mounted to the bottom of a heavy, porcelain coated cast iron sink. Our sink may be better at handling the torque and may dampen the sound and vibration more than a thin stainless steel sink. Our sink weighs probably 75 pounds. A stainless steel sink weighs 7 pounds. A heavier sink can probably handle a garbage disposal operating under full load better than a flexible, lightweight sink. That's not why we got the sink but I think it's probably a benefit to damping sounds and vibrations. Some folks knocked the instructions. Take heart. It appears that the Waste King guys have heard the criticisms from the negative reviewers. I am guessing that they have been re-written to better explain the installation because they are really easy to follow. My best advice is this: don't be afraid of a difficult or confounding set of installation instructions. It is really easy. Here's what you do. Go to youtube.com and search for a video on How To Remove Your Existing Garbage Disposal because this is the hardest part. You will find one that matches yours. Watch it. I started removing the Badger incorrectly, stopped, watched a video, and then it was a piece of cake. In my case, I shouldn't have removed the three long screws before removing the body of the old one. You do it after it is disconnected. READ the instruction manual carefully. Then go ahead and youtube the Waste King installation video. It is very easy once you see it done. No filing or grinding gaskets, and Good Lord, no car jacks under your sink please. If it is hard then you are doing something wrong. STOP!!! Review the procedure. Start again. The directions are actually very explicit. The parts are well labeled. The diagrams show you what to do. The videos show you what to do. If you prepare yourself (15 minutes of reading and watching videos, tops) you will fly though the installation and be a happy person. Regarding the comments that the EZ Mount is flimsy or cheap or plastic, I have to respectfully disagree. The purpose of the lock ring is to compress the rubber gasket tight enough to make a seal so the thing doesn't leak. It doesn't need to be made from titanium or cast iron. Just because it isn't made from a rare earth metal doesn't make it inferior! It keeps the price down and works (so far) flawlessly. I did not need to tap the ears with a small hammer to get it to slide to the fully locked position - I was able to twist it into place with my bare non-Superman hands. I did not need to put dish soap on the ear slots but the directions suggest doing that if it is difficult to put into locked position. Removing ALL the old mounting hardware, cleaning everything really good, and installing the EZ Mount was truly a very easy and thoroughly explained process. No leaks at all on my first attempt! As advertised, it does come with a corded plug so it will need an outlet. My old Badger was a direct wire. Some folks tore out the cord and the strain relief as a fix and hard wired it like their old one. Some folks put an outlet in, which I found that to be a 15 minute job. I didn't want to mess around with chopping out the stock cord and putting in a new one and messing with the strain relief replacement. I thought the new outlet process was much easier because, heck, the wire's already there and that's always the hardest part of wiring a box! I shoved some of the extra length of the existing wire back into the hole in the wall that it came out from. I thought carefully about where the new box should go so the body of the disposal didn't hit it. I screwed it to the back of the cabinet, poked the wires into the box, screwed them to a new receptacle and, voila!. NOTE: IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS YOURSELF. If you do, be sure to kill the power at the circuit breaker and it is probably the easiest box you will install. Just make sure it is securely mounted into something besides the flimsy back panel of the cabinet. I think those are all the important items I wanted to share. The removal of the old one, cleaning the sink hole, and putting in the new box took about 35 minutes start to finish. I wasn't rushing but I was well prepared and had everything ready to go. Plumbers Putty was needed for install. Make sure you have that on hand. There was a thin rubber gasket that went under the flange (between the top flange and a stainless steel sink) that I didn't use because I didn't have a stainless steel sink. The one tricky thing I recall from the directions is that the same procedure is repeated twice in a couple of places - one for using the existing Badger mounting hardware and one for if you are using the EZ Mount system. If you are using the EZ Mount, make sure to SKIP the paragraph that is describing the work as it applies to the Badger mount. That's about it. I had to cut 3/4\" off the black waste discharge pipe (90 degree elbow piece that screws into the new disposal) so that everything fit with my old plumbing. I loosened up all the slip joints on the old plumbing so I could wiggle things around as needed, aligned everything, and tightened the plumbing back up. New install was completed in well under 20 minutes after the removal and outlet installation. I hope this helps some folks who were undecided about this product. How can you ignore a 10 year warranty on something that is well below the price of competing models? No regrets here - we've had it almost a month now and use it daily. We can FINALLY grind those lemon and lime wedges!!! One last thought - Beef bones? I see that Consumer Reports tests these things by measuring the fineness of the grind using beef bones. Do people really put beef bones down a garbage disposal on purpose? You might think I'm babying mine, or maybe that's why I didn't have excessive vibration when I use it, but I'll put the beef bones in the trash and grind up the rest of the stuff with this and be just fine for many years to come, I hope!", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "I bought this disposer because of the excellent review that it was given by Consumer Reports. I guess it was a good value and it works well enough but it's so small that you have to dispose of stuff in small batches. The opening into the sink is so small that if something small falls into it, that's not supposed to go in there, you can't get your fingers past your knuckles and have to fish it out with tongs or some other type of implement.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "The price was right, but the long term prognosis is bad. I was impressed originally after install, both by performance and level of quietness; but after a year or so, it would not hold a seal with the sink, and eventually disintegrated at multiple connection points on the disposal itself. This lead to leaks and mold. Attempts to rectify with the company were unsuccessful, and any contact that was made was met with responses that were abnormally rude. I could not recommend this product or the company's support of the product. Would warn to spend a bit more with another brand for longer term success and piece of mind.", "id": "680343011"}
{"review": "About the product itself: Our previous garbage disposal was only 1/3 horsepower and was much louder than this one. It's so nice to have a brand new garbage disposal that is much quieter and more powerful. Of course, it's brand new, so I can't speak for its longevity, but thus far, we're very pleased. I'm stoked that it accepts bones, pits, and coffee grounds. With our old disposal, we had to throw these in the garbage. About the install: Took me about 2 hours to install, not counting the time it took to run to the local hardware store to grab Plumber's Putty ($2) and a hacksaw ($5). (If you have a steel sink, you will use the rubber gasket that comes with this product, but if you have a ceramic sink, you will need Plumber's Putty). The only kink I ran into while installing it was that the elbow pipe that came with the unit was too long - I needed to saw off about 4 inches, which was incredibly easy with a simple, cheap hacksaw. I followed the directions meticulously and slowly - and all went well! Be sure to pay close attention to the diagrams so that you put all the pieces together precisely as indicated. If you can follow directions, you can self-install this disposal without a problem!", "id": "680343011"}

The plastic mounting system is pure junk.", "id": "680343011"}

I also ordered the Wast King 1025 splashguard at the same time and found it too is 3.15 x 0.52 inches, so this size seems to fit a bunch of garbage disposals including my General Electric GFC530V. The splashguard I found locally was 3.39 inches in diameter, which prompted my on-line search.

{"review": "I bought this for my Whirlaway disposal, assuming it was an exact replacement for the old one (because it looks similar, silly me). As it turns out, it is very much not the same, the rubber teeth are smaller, at a shallower angle, and less pliable, the result being that water won't even drain at close to the flow rate of my faucet (a totally normal residential faucet). Of course you can forget about anything solid going through it, you'll have to plunger even the smallest debris through this baby. Given that garbage disposals are supposed to make your sink drain BETTER, I feel this pretty much nullifies the advantage of having one. For now I have been using the disposal without a splash guard, and just using the sink stopper when I run it. Would definitely NOT recommend this splash guard.

{"review": "This is the splashguard, baffle that fits Sinkmaster, Whirlaway, Waste King, and probably everything that uses the EZ-Mount system by Anaheim Mfg. Do not confuse this with the \"Universal-fits most disposals\" one that hardware stores sell. Those are 3 1/8 to 3 1/4\" in diameter, and they're too big. Won't fit. Looks the same but a little bigger, and it won't fit. This one will. It is exactly 3\" in diameter. If your old one is pretty worn out, you will be amazed at how much quieter it will be when you replace this simple, no-tools-necessary part. I only knocked off a star for the price. This would still be a very profitable item at half the price. My disposal is a 1/3 hp BoneCrusher that I paid $23 for probably 12 years old.. We run it a couple times daily, but with really light loading. The trick to disposal longevity and drawing a blank stare when someone asks if you know a good drain cleaner is to use this sequence for food disposal: Turn on cold water in the disposal-side basin. Turn on disposal. Slowly add food to disposal, making sure plenty of water is going into disposal. About 10 seconds after you're done disposing, turn off disposal. Let water run another 10 seconds.", "id": "680343011"}

{"review": "I've used a few different types of humidifiers over the past couple years, and my favorite so far has been a warm mist/vapor humidifier, like the simple boiling water kind you get from Vicks. Those humidifiers put out a lot of humidity, they're easy to refill, and they don't make everything in a room get a white powdery coating. Ultrasonic/cool mist humidifiers often make a white powder coating appear on some surfaces if you have hard water (like I do), but they are quieter (no boiling or fans), they don't raise the ambient temperature, and the mist can be directed via the vent at the top. They also don't use filters, so there is no maintenance or extras you have to purchase other than a simple weekly (at least) cleaning. This humidifier has simple controls (on/off switch on the back, mist level knob on the front), and a neat little port on the top that you can direct in two different spots. I usually just keep both vents pointed in the same direction. Refilling is easy; just grab the translucent top part, turn it upside-down, unscrew the drain plug, and fill in a standard-size sink. If I set the level to low/medium, I can use the humidifier up to a full day or so before a refill. If set on high, it only seems to last about 8-10 hours. Also, the humidifier shuts itself off if it senses no more water. RECOMMENDATION: If you need a simple cool mist humidifier, like one for a baby's room, this is a great option--especially if you only need to have it on for a small part of the day (otherwise you'll be refilling it a lot). TIP FOR LONGEVITY: Make sure you follow the included cleaning instructions, especially with regard to cleaning mineral buildup every week. If you don't this humidifier will probably only last a year or less (especially if you have hard water at your home, and don't use distilled water to humidify the air). If you clean it weekly, expect years of use.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "Pros: I love that I can turn it on high and get a room humidified fast. (When needed, I can leave it on high for an our or two to get one kid's room humidified for bed time and then move it to another kid's room). I love that I can turn it on low and leave it for two days running without touching it. And that there are settings in between high and low. I love that it doesn't have a filter to deal with and to purchase regularly! I have used a filtered ultrasonic humidifier in the past, and besides having the filter to deal with, I disliked that it was so slow to humidify a room. After a day it was fine, but when a child is sick at night, you want the humidifier to work immediately. Cons: The plastic tank is very thin. Others have complained about it leaking after a while. I had mine for half of a season and then it was knocked over from a high shelf and broke. That is understandable from how hard it fell, but I worry about how long my new one will last. The tank is also a little awkward to fill. It would be nice if it had a flat top or a better handle. But it's not bad. I didn't clean my first one as often as I should have, and then I did have a hard time keeping it clean. The second time around, I rinse it all every time I change the water (or sometimes sooner if I have it on low), and rinse with vinegar once a week as it explains in the instructions, and have had no problems keeping it clean. The switch is easy to move from low to high, and I have had the problem of a child turning it up to high at night without me knowing, and things being a little too humid the next morning. I spent a lot of time looking at humidifiers, and I am very happy with this purchase for the reasons mentioned and with the relatively low price.

{"review": "I love Amazon because of the reviews. For the most part, the reviews are honest, detailed and very helpful, especially when a true defect or some other \"quirk\" is described. However, many of the reviews for this item are really...bizarre! I have to wonder what some of these reviewers were actually thinking. Also, are they are realistic in their expectations? It is what it is - an inexpensive humidifier. It WILL make some noise, It will NOT humidify your entire house, it WILL require cleaning and care, it will NOT last forever, etc. 1) This item is being shipped from a warehouse to your home. If it arrives broken, cracked, leaking or damaged in any way, contact Amazon- they offer one of the best return policies around. This is an issue with whoever shipped it, not a reason to leave a one-star rating. 2) This is a HUMIDIFIER and uses tap water and electricity to create a heated mist. Should you be horrified to find mold or mildew? NO. Does it require regular maintenance and cleaning? YES. There is no way around it. If you allow water to sit, mold will grow. If you use tap water, there is a good chance you will have mineral deposits. Inspect the humidifier each time you fill it. When you re-fill the tank, give it a good rinsing out. It if smells, add a teaspoon of bleach, swish it around and dump it out. If it has deposits around the heating element, pour vinegar into the bottom, let it sit for a few hours, take a small toothbrush to it and rinse it out. If it has deposits on the plastic pieces, remove them from the unit and soak them in vinegar, same as above. It is not difficult to disassemble at all. It is a fact of life, humidifiers need to be cleaned and maintained. 3) This is a very INEXPENSIVE humidifier. Is it helpful to compare it to a humidifier that costs 5x as much? NO. That is like comparing a Toyota Corolla (MSRP 25K) to a Bentley Continental (MSRP 175K). 4) This is an electrical device. Like anything that uses electricity, it has the potential to start a fire. Even though it has an automatic shut-off, I wouldn't bet my house on it. Pay a little attention to it and treat it like any other electrical device. 5) Seriously, having to carry it by it's handle with the plug on top is a big issue? Would you carry a bottle of water (or any liquid with a screw cap, for that matter) upside down? As for the leaking, screwing the cap on tightly and carrying it by it's handle would probably help. 6) Will it last for a lifetime? NO. Does any inexpensive product last beyond a few years? NO. Will the gaskets dry out if it is stored for long periods of time? It's entirely possible. Again, this is an INEXPENSIVE humidifier. BOTTOM LINE: It is very reasonable priced, does a good job and lasts a couple of years if you take care of it. I am about to make my 4th purchase of this exact humidifier. I read the reviews to see if anything changed or if a better, similarly priced unit was introduced into the market. The answer is NO. This is the best deal for the money. ****UPDATE**** 11/19/2011 Almost one year later, last week I pulled out the humidifiers and gave 'em a nice, thorough cleaning, set 'em up and they are working perfectly. I am going on at least my 5th New England winter with the first one I bought, and it still works like new - whisper quiet, zero leaking, couldn't be happier for the price! From the looks of it, Amazon's price hasn't changed much either (although it does fluctuate day-to-day). It's still the BEST YOU\"LL FIND in this price range!", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I knew i needed a humidifier, as i'm just not used to the dry air of east coast winters. But after shopping around on amazon for warm mist humidifiers, i was horrified by the reviews. Every humidifier seemed to be loud, leaky, and a hassle. I ended up getting this one because of the relatively low price, thinking that if it was as bad as all the others, at least i wouldn't have spent too much on it. I have no complaints. On the low setting, it's about as loud as a pot of water boiling in the next room. On the high setting, it might compete with a pot of water boiling in the same room. Every once in a while it gets a bit talkative, but that's rare and doesn't last long. I'm a light sleeper, and this unit never wakes me up. On the low setting, a full tank of water lasts a little over 24 hours. On the high setting, it goes through in about 8 to 9 hours, perfect to run overnight. The auto-shutoff works just fine, so i don't even bother turning it off before i leave the house. It is a bit annoying to clean the unit, but that has a lot to do with the tap water here being less than perfectly clean. We switched to using filtered water, and now the humidifier is actually our way of knowing when to change the filter. When there's build-up on the heating element, the filter isn't working as well anymore. The daily maintenance takes no more than a few minutes. The weekly maintenance takes longer, but that's mainly because you throw some of the pieces in to soak. It's maybe 10 minutes of effort, plus however long you want to soak the pieces. In all, i'm very glad i purchased this unit. (And the water tank isn't nearly as blue as it looks in the picture.)", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "Yesterday I went downtown to look for a humidifier for my bedroom. What I thought would be an easy project turned into one of frustration. I wound up going to three different drug stores to try to get an idea of what to buy. Most of the humidifiers I saw were by Kaz (Vicks), who makes many different models. To make choosing a model supposed easier, somewhere along the line the company put a graph on only some of their model's boxes to indicate which model to buy based on your needs. (I wanted it for colds and flu). This graph was at one point changed and updated. But the problem is that Kaz doesn't label their boxes too well as to what model applies to the graph. From what I can tell it is these newer graphs that grade their humidifiers as Best, Better, Good or nothing depending upon the purpose intended. But if you are trying to choose between warm or cool all Kaz tells the consumer is some people prefer the warm mist to the cool mist while some don't. How this is supposed to help the consumer decide I'll never know. Anyhow, I wound up with this model (v745A) because it was supposed to be all purpose and being the winter here in the NE I thought warm rather than cool mist would be better. An added benefit with the warm mist is that you can add an inhalant and with my current cold that would help. I did have some concerns about whether this unit would be enough for my 16x16x10 room. Kaz only labels some of their boxes with the size room the unit is good for but this one does not say. All my observances below were made using this unit on the high setting. BUILD: The unit itself is built OK nothing more (and I didn't expect more) but seems a little flimsy. NOISE: OK, the noise. Come on people, this device boils water for steam, hence the name \"Warm Mist\". You should not expect this to be absolutely silent so stop whining. And for those of you with the \"Princess and the Pea\" syndrome do NOT buy it. But for those who want an idea of what it sounds like from 3 feet away think of it is like the sound of a rainy day or it is like having an aquarium in the room. It is not loud at all (certainly no louder than a fan on low speed) and could be soothing to those who like white noise. PERFORMANCE: This unit does humidify my bedroom but it does take a while to have its effect, so I would start it before I went to bed. The amount of mist that comes out is probably not as great as if you were boiling water in a soup pan. [Please do not have unrealistic expectations: your room will not to turn into a steam bath and you will not see the mirrors fog up as they do in the bathroom.] Ideally, two of these in my room would probably suit it better. I can not say that the added inhalant has a great effect. I can smell it in the mist as it is coming out right above the unit but would not be aware of it otherwise. Incidentally, Vicks makes a personal model of these, but I would skip it in favor of this one because you could just breath in the vapors as it comes out of the top of this unit for the same effect. CONCLUSION: Overall I am OK with this purchase. Frankly, I don't see how anyone could \"love\" this device or anything like it. It does what it does. I am not sure if another model would have been better. Kaz really needs to make choosing between these models easier. Having used it now I would only recommend a WARM mist for winter use (when most colds and flu occur). It would be too warm and uncomfortable at other times. I have not had it long enough to test its durability.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I purchased the vicks cool mist humidifier (v3100) while visiting my family out west for the holidays. I had a sore throat and that mixed with the heater running and the already very dry air and i was getting up to get a drink 4 times a night. the first night i spent with the humidifier i didn't get up at all. i decided to leave it there and use it every time i visit, summer or fall. and i liked having a humidifier so much i bought a warm mist one, the v745a for my midwest apartment. here is a comparison of the two. i bought the cool mist for the desert because it was cheaper and will only be used a few weeks a year but will be both summer and winter. it does blow a lot of cool air and will be especially nice in the summer. some people found it quite loud but i thought it was reasonable and used it on the high setting. but i am also used to sleeping with a fan on during the summer. i liked the fact that its shape is lower to the ground making it difficult to tip over. and the seal for the water tank is easier to open and close all the way to prevent leaks. but even after one week's use at night the filter is already more yellow than i expected. if i was using it every day i would have to change it very regularly. it also does move a lot of air like i said before, but the vents are low and it seemed like it was blowing all that moist air right under the bed. i bought the warm mist humidifier for my apartment because i will only be using it in the winter and didn't want the cold air when my heater is aready working so hard. and i figured it would be more useful during cold season because of the attached medicine cup. it is also for medium/large rooms while the cool mist is for smal/medium so i could move it to my living room if needed. and because i saw the filter on the cool mist got so dirty so fast i liked the fact that this one had no filter, no parts to replace. just weekly cleaning. and the cost difference between this one and the cool mist is about the cost of one filter replacement. it makes very little difference in terms of air temperature, does not heat it up as much as i thought it would, vs the cool mist which did make the room quite a bit cooler. i like the fact that the steam comes out of the top instead of under the bed and it is more quiet than the cool mist even when on the high setting. it does have automatic shut off so i don't have to worry about it boiling dry. i did some research online about warm vs cool humidifiers before purchasing them, and many recommended cool mist for children because of burn risk from using the warm. even after being on all night the unit is cool to the touch and it has a cooling chamber so even the steam that comes out is unlikely to burn. the only way i think a child could injure themselves with this unit would be if they tipped it over, took it apart and touched the actual heating unit because of the auto shut off. my husband guessed the warm mist might take more electricity to run but we'll have to see about that. overall i am a little happier with the warm mist because i need it for winter, it is quieter and needs to filters replaced. but they are both excellent and inexpensive and once you get one you will wonder why you waited so long. (and by the way the cool mist is $29.99 at target and the warm is $34.99, sorry amazon)", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I bought this little guy because this winter was brutal for sore throats, nose bleeds, and static electricity in my little home in upstate NY. The rabbit was going around looking like a charged puffball, giving off actual sparks. The cats cringed when I went to pet them, and I was simply miserable myself. I'm probably overworking the poor thing, but the sore throats have backed down, the cats are letting me pet them again.. and although the rabbit still looks like a static charged puffball, he's at least not giving off any sparks. When I say \"overworking\", I mean that I'm using it to humidiate (I know, no such word, but it sounds good!) my entire 900+ square foot house, 24/7. So I don't expect miracles out of it, but any relief is... well, a relief. I use it on the Low setting, and it is not loud enough that it bothers me. Sounds a little like a muffled pot of boiling water. Had it on High once and it sounded like a slightly LESS muffled pot of boiling water. If you are a light sleeper and bothered by any noises, you might not want it in your bedroom, but I personally find it a rather comforting sound. Then again... it's not in MY bedroom. I LOVE the fact that the tank has handles on both ends. I have fibromyalgia, and if there's a way to drop something, I can drop it. Two handles will cut that chance down just that much more. I also love that parts of it can go in the dishwasher. In fact, that was one of the reasons why I bought it - hey, it goes in the dishwasher! That and no filters! They saw me coming! Down-side - only PARTS of it go in the dishwasher. The cooling chamber, medicine cup, and water tray CAN go in the dishwasher. The tank CAN'T. To disinfect the tank, you have to soak it in a bleach/water mixture. They recommend doing that once a week. Also, the water tray and heating chamber need to be soaked in vinegar once a week to remove any scale build-up. THIS IS IMPORTANT IF YOU HAVE HARD WATER. In fact, I'd recommend it MORE than once a week. I do have hard water, and I saw build-up in just two days. And just soaking and wiping didn't do it - I took a toothbrush to it. I noticed several reviews saying theirs broke down rather quickly. If they didn't do the vinegar treatment or didn't do it often enough, I could certainly see WHY it would break down. Other nifty things. It has a night-light! Also, on the Low setting, one tank lasts me almost 24 hours. And in case I do forget to watch, it also has an automatic shut-off. Like I say, they saw me coming. So yeah, I love it. But ya gotta clean it. And probably often. But my cats love me again. And the rabbit? Well... a piece of papaya goes a long way towards making amends with him. Edited to add: Here we are, a few years later, and I recommended this to my mother. Warned her about the \"YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT EVERY WEEK. AT LEAST\" factor. In fact, I warned her repeatedly. Granted, she's always frantically busy, so I can kinda understand what happened next... She called me and told me that it had cracked and sprung a leak three weeks after she had bought it. She hadn't cleaned it. So there you have it. Proof positive. I used my constantly over the winter. Cleaned it every week. No damage. She had it three weeks. Didn't clean it. It bled a full tank of water all over her kitchen. Woe. It's coming up winter, and the rabbit is sending off sparks again. Time to dig this out and fire it up. Or is that.. water it up?", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "Humidifiers can be placed into 4 categories based on how they generate vapor: evaporative, ultrasonic, steam, and impeller. It took me a little while to figure out what I wanted, so hopefully I can save others some time by summarizing what I found. Evaporative humidifiers move air over water, usually with an absorbing \"wick\" or spinning disks, for an accelerated version of the natural evaporation process. Electricity is used only to run a fan or other rotating element, so evaporative humidifiers are the cheapest to run. The physics of evaporation lead to two qualities: They are self regulating, as the water will cease evaporating once the air is saturated, and they have a slight cooling effect. The rate of humidity pumped out is relatively low. The wicking medium - usually a corrugated paper or paper/cloth material - can harbor mold, so you must change the water regularly and avoid letting the water stand around. The fans vary in noise level. Example: Vornado Whole-Room Evaporative Humidifier, HU1-0021-28 Ultrasonic humidifiers use a membrane vibrating at high frequency to atomize water molecules. The vapor output is high and the machines are the quietest of all humidifiers. Their energy usage is middle-of-road: more than evaporatives, and less than steam-based. The main drawback of ultrasonics is that the vibrating membrane atomizes not just water, but also anything else in the water - microorganisms, and particularly minerals, which may appear as a \"white dust\". This is a big con for allergy sufferers, so many units include replaceable demineralization cartridges and water filters to eliminate microorganisms and minerals before they get atomized. You can use keep replacing these cartridges, or keep buying distilled water, making ultrasonics rather costly. The vapor will be the temperature of the water - which is to say cool, unless you choose a unit with a heating element. Example: SPT SU-4010 Ultrasonic Dual-Mist Warm/Cool Humidifier with Ion Exchange Filter Steam humidifiers heat water to the boiling point until they, well, boil and produce water vapor. Any microorganisms will be killed, and any minerals are left behind in the water reservoir, making steam humidifiers excellent for allergy sufferers. The left-behind minerals can be significant if your water is dirty, so these units must be cleaned regularly (rinsed out every couple days, and a vinegar soak one a week). Alternatively, you can use distilled water. Energy use on steam humidifiers is highest, usually around 200-300 watts, as they must heat the water. The vapor coming out will be hot - good for winter colds and flus, but also a small concern for those with small children. Impellers are kind of a cross between evaporatives and ultrasonics. They pass water at high speed through the air, making them similar to evaporatives, but they do so with enough mechanical force that other particles are atomized as well, imparting the same problems of white dust and microorganisms. Example: Sunbeam Health 645-800 Cool Mist Humidifier I needed strong humidification, so it was a choice between steam and ultrasonics. I was wary of the ultrasonics because I would have to live with white dust, or keep buying either cleaning cartridges or distilled water. They also tend to be the costliest humidifiers. So I chose this ~$30 Vicks steam humidifier, which does the job well and produces plenty of clean vapor. My water is pretty dirty and an unsightly crust builds on the heating element after a few days of constant use, but I'm glad it's in there and not in my lungs. The water volume is on the small size, but this has the advantage of being damage control when/if it springs a leak someday. Another category to consider, by the way, are air washers, which usually combine an impeller design with electrolysis of water to both clean and humidify air. The humidification level is similar to evaporative and impeller designs, so they weren't for me. Example: Sanyo ABC-VW24 Air Washer Air Purification System with Electrolyzed Water Technology", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I was incredibly happy with this product for 2 1/2 weeks. I did the recommended daily cleaning (yes, it's a pain but you have to make sure your 'crud' doesn't harden like cement). I did the weekly cleaning with the vinegar too. Yesterday it started leaking. I checked the tank - no leaks. It had to be coming from the base/heating element. With the tank off, I filled the base/heating unit area (like I was cleaning it) and watched as it continued to leak. So I took the entire bottom off the unit and everything was soaked inside (i.e. the wires!!!). It appears the seal on the heating element has gone bad after 2 1/2 weeks. It's going back to the store.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "We're on our fourth month with this humidifier, and it performs well even if it is a tad noisy. However, you MUST clean this humidifier at least once a week just as the directions advise you to. I buy the cheapest white vinegar available---under $2.00 per gallon at Walmart. Every Saturday I let the heating element in the base soak in vinegar for most of the day. One could use distilled water in the tank instead of tap water to avoid the mineral build-up, but at about $1.50 a gallon PER DAY, distilled water is a much more costly option than weekly cleaning. This humidifier will almost certainly fail if it isn't cleaned regularly. That said, (and it's what the directions intimate), it's a pretty good machine for the money.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I have had my Vicks Humidifier for over 2 years now. I love it but haven't reviewed it until now that I'm buying another one for my 2nd bedroom I read so many negative reviews I felt compelled to put in my 2 cents. NOISE: I'm not sure what anyone expects from something that literally has to boil your water but to me it's pretty quiet. I hear a gurgle now and then but if anything the quiet hum helps me sleep and never wakes up my twins (i have 3 year old boys) EFFECTIVENESS: I usually work this on high in the boys bedroom. It works great, I see and feel the steam in the air. It warms up the room nicely so I don't have to heat the house so high throughout the night. The moisture is perfect, not too much. For those wanting less moisture you can put it on the low setting which also reduces the noise. Without this the air in my house is very dry and my son gets nosebleeds. He has NEVER gotten one if I run this humidifier. It's like magic. Without the humidifier he is SURE to get a nosebleed and this does the trick. What a difference it makes! Also, the auto shut off feature has not failed me yet which is a plus because I do forget sometimes. It does not overheat, has never leaked hot water on me. My boys have both touched it (if you have toddlers you know they will touch everything) and it does not burn and does not leak. MEDICINE CUP: I use the Vicks Vaposteam and that feature works great, it scents up the entire bedroom and keeps the boys breathing easy. If I run out of Vaposteam, another hint is to rub the VapoRub on the boys chests and the steam from the Humidifier actually picks that up and really makes it effective. CLEANING: In a nutshell, I am LAZY. With twins, I have little time but even I find the cleaning easy and worth the 15-20 minutes, which I honestly only do like once a week. I see alot of people use Vinegar, but you might want to consider what I use which I originally purchased when I had my first cool mist humidifier. Its the BIONAIRE CLEAN AWAY HUMIDIFIER CLEANING SOLUTION. I buy a big 32 oz bottle of this and it lasts a long time. I soak the parts for about 10 minutes and the lime and mineral crusts just falls apart. I use a brush lightly, rinse and voila! Perfectly clean that quick. For the tank, I throw some up in there with some water, swish it around, rinse a couple times completely and the tank is still clean with absolutely no stains after 2 years! So for those that don't like to clean, definitely try the Bionare, it will make your life easy. I buy it online. OVERALL: No performance problems after 2 years. I'm buying a 2nd one bc now the boys like to crawl into bed with me in the middle of the night, and I can't bother to take it out of their room to transport into mine in the middle of the night and hubby and I have decided we want to breathe easier this winter also. I wouldn't buy anything else for our bedrooms. If I needed one for the living room that is the only way I would consider getting something else simply because I feel this is suited for a medium size room, not large. But what this promises to do, it does. I love it and if you get it for the right reasons with the realistic expectations, you will too!!", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "We bought two of these, one for each of our kid's bedrooms. To this day, I still don't know what's wrong with the one - but I've lost faith in these. The one leaked all night long and ruined a dresser and a section of carpet/padding. $900 in damage later, both are in the trash. I am just thankful it didn't catch fire because it leaked straight down through and water was coming out of the bottom. I inspected it thoroughly and could not find any problems, cracks or anything. The one that leaked we've had for about a year and this was the first problem. I tried to reproduce the issue on our kitchen counter. It worked great with no leaks for about an hour or two. Then we came back into the kitchen and found its tank almost empty and water all over the counter and floor. We were prepared this time - so no more damage.

It's a pain to clean but doesn't use filters so the overall cost is much lower.

{"review": "I've been through about a dozen different humidifiers over the years. It gets extremely dry here in the winter so we run these all the time. Sound: For those of you that appreciate white noise to help you sleep, this probably won't be enough for you. This is the quietest humidifier I've found. Refills: On the highest setting this will last around 18 hours so I can easily run it for two nights without refills. On a lower setting, running only at night, I'd imagine you could get away with refills only every 4 nights or so. The handle design is the most comfortable and well balanced of any humidifier I've ever owned so trips to and from the sink aren't so awkward. The lid is extremely easy to get off/on and my husband never over tightens this one. The fill tank opening is not only easy to get into but very large so a gushing flow from the tub can fill it up very quickly. Air Quality: I don't know how it does it, but it does the best job of any humidifier I've ever owned. You will never have water condensation around the base (or anywhere else for that matter). The air never gets too heavy with moisture that it feels muggy (although I've never tried it on high in a room smaller than 10x10). But it makes a very noticeable difference to my comfort and breath-ability during colds. Because the air output is straight up, you don't have to worry about having it too near dressers or bed linens or anything else getting too wet. The only downfalls are the price (most expensive in a lot of stores) and the size. It is pretty large. But I think the size is worth it as it is used for a more powerful fan and a large water tank leaving refills less frequent.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "This unit is comprised of four parts that are elegant in their simplicity and optimization. Part 1, the base \"platter\", is merely a simple piece of tough plastic (no motor, no switches, nothing electrical, no mounted parts at all) embossed to provide channels that conduct water from one end (where Part 2, the reservoir \"jug\", sits) to the other end where the water is absorbed up into the cylindrical wick \"filter\" cylinder (Part 3) where the powerful fan in the upper main unit (Part 4) pulls air through the moist filter perimeter and ejects it upward into the room. In my moderately large house (3600 sq ft) I have 4 of these units running, and the reservoirs (1+ gallons) have to be refilled every 12 hours (8+ gallons per day total) to maintain reasonable humidity in house. These work much better than my furnace-mounted humidifier. Reservoir refill process is, take a 2 gallon plastic bucket of water to humidifier, lift out reservoir, lift off main unit, put wick filter in bucket to soak, make a trip to sink to refill reservoir jug, put wick filter back in place, put main unit back in place, drop reservoir jug into main unit, move on to next humidifier. In a 4-month heavy heating season, you'll need new throw-away wick filters ($9) at the outset, and half-way through. (The manufacturer-supplied wick filters are the only item that can be improved on. Don't buy Honeywell's replacement. Get Sunbeam SWF-227. They're 5-1/2\" instead of 5\" tall, but after they're soaked, you can easily squish them down.) At end of season, clean platter and reservoir in the dishwasher if you like, and wipe down underside of main unit surfaces with a damp cloth. Not absolutely necessary, the surfaces don't accumulate deposits that much. The only other thing you'll need to replace periodically is the special UV lamp that shines down from the main unit into the water channel to kill any stray incoming bacteria/virus. Get humidified, and stop the itching.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I'm very picky about humidifiers. I literally spent multiple hours researching online before getting this one. For me, it has to be an evaporative one. I do not like the thought of germs and chemicals from the water going airborne as atomized particles. Evaporative wick humidifiers just draw water up with a wick then blow a fan over it to move the moisture into the air. It's simple. For me, that's really all I need. However, the delivery mechanism really makes a difference. Previously, I had a big old cabinet water wheel. It was old, kind of nasty and really took up a lot of space. When I decided to replace it I looked for something smaller but that still had the large capacity I like. My house gets really dry in the winter between the windows that leak letting in the cold and the baseboard heat. So I need a lot of output. This one is working well for me as far as bulk of unit and output. I miss only having to fill once a week with the big water wheel (this is more once every day during peak need) but I know in order to have that luxury, I'd need a bigger unit. I also like the assembly of this unit. There are four pieces: the base, the housing, the water basin and the wick. Everything fits together and assembly is stupid-proof. I've only had this unit running with some regularity for 2 months. I haven't had any wick problems yet. I know people seem to complain about that a lot. I mean, if I turn it on at night, come back in the morning and the water is half gone, I know the wick is working. So far that's what's happening. If your wick is dry (when you first get the unit or after a long time with a dry reserve), soak it thoroughly before you use it. Also, the base retains water so if you stop using it for a period of time, dump out the extra water, squeeze out the wick and let all the parts set out separately to dry. Nothing is maintenance free, you have to take care of your things if you want them to last :)", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "Bought the Honeywell HCM-350 two months ago to help to eliminate the dryness in our bedroom during the winter months. The unit is quiet and attractive. We run it on low, 24 hrs. a day, and you don't even notice any sound coming from it. It has eliminated the dry stuffy nose problems you always have in a house heated with forced air heat. Both my wife and I sleep better and breath easier during the night. I would recommend this unit to anyone wanting to humidify a single large room. It will NOT humidify an entire house, but may do the job for a small apartment. I would definitely recommend this unit to friends. The filter needs to be replaced periodically as minerals from your tap water will accumulate with time. The filter life can be extended by soaking it in vinegar and rinsing it out once it gets \"limed up\". The filter will still need to be replaced with this cleaning method, but not as often.

{"review": "My wife and I spent a lot of time reading reviews of humidifiers looking for the clear best product to go in our room after the birth of our son. Unfortunately, lots of humidifiers have mixed reviews--even this one. Still, it had a lot of praise and relatively few complaints. We have been using it for about a month now and have no complaints. The reservoir is easy to fill and we have had no leaks. A full tank will last all night and a lot of the morning on high. On medium, a half tank will get you through the night. On low, even less. The noise level ranges from a moderate white noise on high to a barely audible purr on low. The sound is that of a small fan--no high pitched whining or anything like that. I have not had to replace the filter, so I cannot comment on that part of the process. Likewise for the UV sanitizing bulb. The picture gave me the impression of a rather large and bulky unit, but actually its pleasantly small and discreet. I have been able to find an out-of-the-way spot for it in any room. Similarly, the unit is light enough, even filled, to be carried to a new room without much fuss. The last thing I wanted to comment on was that unlike the Vicks humidifier I can remember from my own childhood that constantly exuded a plume of cool mist, this one emits no visible mist. This is because the unit blows air over a saturated filter. Water evaporates into the air as transparent water vapor instead of being sprayed into the air as an aerosol of steam-like droplets. While I was a little disappointed to miss out on the nostalgia of seeing the familiar mist plume, I rather like this more efficient approach. We have easily noticed this winter that the air in the bedroom is much more comfortable to breathe than that in the rest of the house. Our new son is a month old and has yet to have any nose-related issues. THE ONE CON: This is not really a con with this particular unit, but just a fact that you should know. As mentioned, the unit draws air through a saturated filter Honeywell Humidifier Wick Filter, Single, HAC-504AW to humidify the air. When the water evaporates it leaves behind all of the dissolved minerals. Over the course of a few weeks (in my case about a month with only nighttime use) the filter gathers enough mineral residue to stop drawing water out of the reservoir. The filters and paper and must be replaced they run about $10 each. I didn't really think about this or expect it until the unit's water level stopped going down and I found the filter hard and dry. Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of this unit, and strongly recommend it.", "id": "267555011"}

The face mask (I'll call it that) fits me well but I usually keep my head a few inches away when the steam really starts to engage.

{"review": "I got my Vicks Steam Inhaler a few days ago. I had been choosing between it and the Mabis one. However, the latter costs $20 more so I decided to go with this one considering almost identical review ratings. I would rate it with 4.5 starts, not with 5. There is still a little room for improvement. It is pretty compact and quick. It starts producing steam in about 4 minutes. Yes, you can regulate the amount of steam. But I found that hot air makes me breath faster and, as a result, there is not enough steam produced by the machine between my breaths. Fortunately, I came up with a nice and simple solution. The mask has a few holes in it to mix the steam with some fresh air. If I cover with my fingers some or all three holes I get enough steam with every inhalation. It's pretty convenient, at least, for me and allows to (manually) regulate the amount of steam. Another thing important for me was a possibility to use oil. Neither Vicks or Mabis inhaler assume that you can directly add aroma oil to water. Both brands sale their own inhaler pads designed to work with their machines. But the choice of oils is very limited. By the way, the Vicks Inhaler comes with a disposable pad good for one time use. Some people reported that they had still added a few drops of oil. For some it worked fine, for the others it didn't work that well screwing in some way the water heating surface. What I did is I bought this refill kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XPX1HG) and it's been working great for me. You can put a pad directly on the plastic thing with the holes the steam comes out. The only difference with the original pad is form but it works great. It does not mess with the water heating surface and you can refill those cotton pads with any oil you want. For the future, I'm going to buy cotton pads and oil separately.

I wouldn't rate the product badly just based on seeing that there's plastic in it, but you can clearly smell the plastic/teflon in the steam. Some people say it's the soft plastic in the mask (as if it makes a difference where it's coming from, it all goes to your lungs) but I took it off and smelled the steam directly and the smell is definitely coming from the boiling plate. Maybe the smell goes away after a number of uses, but that's because you've inhaled it all by that point. Would you boil tea in a plastic teflon coated kettle and inhale the steam while it's heating up? I'll stick with the Conair unit even though it doesn't have the extra little features because the boiling pot is made of uncoated metal and the face mask is a hard rigid plastic (less comfortable but less smelly).", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I got a good chuckle out of reading some of the negative reviews on this unit. I own an industrial water treatment contracting company and it always strikes me as funny how uneducated people are with water, something they use every day. I figured I would take a minute and clarify a couple of things for people that use or are planning on purchasing one of these humidifiers, (Oh and yes I actually own one) Humidifiers have been a part of our family for around fifteen years after I read a study on how they can reduce the usual winter ailments, colds and flu's. First how these units work. If you take the humidifying unit apart, you will find two probes. I believe they make them out of Carbon and other materials. They are round and about ½\" thick, and approximately four inches long. These probes are then connected the electrical cord. When you plug it in and the probes are immersed in water, they create an electrical current between the two probes. This creates water that boils, and thus creates steam. Some key facts about water. Pure water will not conduct an electrical current. This is why the instructions recommend adding a pinch of salt if your unit does not produce steam. The salt when disolved increases the TDS, (more on that in a minute) thus creating a conductive in the water. Water is considered the Universal Solvent. In other word's water pretty much will absorb and dissolve anything that we submerge or add to it. Sometimes instantly. Sometimes over time. Two key things are in water that effect these humidifiers. One is the hardness of the water. Hardness is measured by checking how much Calcium and Magnesium is in the water. The other effect is Totally Dissolved Solids, or TDS. (all the other minerals that actually dissolve into water) When you boil water, (essentially what these units do), the vapor that they produce is considered pure water or close too pure. So in essence as the water vapor escapes the unit what is left behind are the residual minerals, (tds) and the hardness, (magnesium and Calcium). Generally the Hardness cakes on the probes and creates a cement like residual. TDS usually fall out of suspension as clumps. Gray/black sand/rock formations. So when you read comments in these reviews about residual inside the tank, or that the unit stopped producing steam, what these people are referring to is the residual left over after the water is boiled off. Depending on the water quality of their tap, the residual can be a lot or very little. Ok, before you purchase one of these units, just remember. It's $15.00. (Wal Mart has them for a few bucks less) Your not buying an ultra fancy $200.00 BrookStone humidifier/vaporizier. These are generally one season, low maintenance, throw them away when you're done. (depending how many days out of the year you fire them up) So keep that in mind. If you want to make one last, you can get some plain white vinegar. Find a jar or container that the Humidifying unit will fit into. That means something that the bottom portion that sets in the water not the top part where the cord goes in. (Edited this to better explain it) and fill it with 3/4 vinegar and the rest water, creating a mild acid solution. Set the probe portion in it and let it soak for a day. Repeat as necessary until the unit operates to your liking. Note the probes inside the unit do wear out, and hard water deposits do cake up pretty thick on the probes which increase that Wear and Tear effect. (I've taken enough of them apart to know) Bottom line - If you want a cheap way of creating warm humidified air these are the unit for you. Don't expect anything more then what they price them at, and if you don't plan on maintaining them, ie using vinegar to keep the probes semi-clean of hardness deposits, then expect no more then one to two years of use.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "After my daughter was born, we purchased this for her room. I'm surprised to read all the complaints about this humidifier, because it's a cheap, low maintanance item! I must admit, that after 5 years of use (used anytime the furnace is on) and with little or no cleaning, it's doing just fine! We have hard water and we do have a softener, so no salt is needed. As soon as we fill it up and plug it in, the thing starts boiling away, QUIETLY. The directions say it lasts 18-24 hours, but in reality, it doesn't with our water. The more minerals and salt in the water, the faster it boils out of the tank. No smells, no white residue, just easy to use and no parts to replace. In the morning, we take it to the sink, dump out the black specks of minerals (THIS IS NORMAL) and refill it for the next night. I like the idea of the boiling water killing germs. We don't have any slime or gunk filling up the tank like our other evaporative humidifier. I love the cup on the top for medicine placement. I buy a huge bottle of essential oil of eucalyptus, and pour some in the cup when someone in the family is sick. Works like a charm! When it's time to replace this one, I would not hesitate to buy another. It's a very basic humidifier that raises the humidity quickly. I would buy the largest model of this type. Considering the horrible reviews on the other models, it doesn't seem to be worth buying anything else. Even if something goes wrong with it, it really isn't that much of a problem considering the cost of the unit. UPDATE: Shortly after I wrote the review, my unit stoppped working. It had a great run! Of course we replaced it with the same unit. It is currently sitting on my kitchen counter and we keep it running all night, every night and all day on the weekends. My favorite design was the old one. The new larger models have large, flat bases which are harder to drain, clean and fill. Even though it says it has larger capacity, the steamer does not use all the water up. It stops steaming after using one gallon of water, leaving extra in the base which is fine with me. Each day I pour in another gallon, and plug it in.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "Very simple and easy to use. About the black particles that develop in the water after use, I found the following explanation to be helpful: \"A Vaporizer produces moisture by heating small amounts of the minerals in the water using tiny electrodes in the shaft of the unit. The minerals then heat the water to a boil and release steam into the air. The minerals will then settle to the bottom of the tank, possibly becoming small black flakes. These flakes are normal and should be rinsed out when you refill the tank. Any bacteria or mold in the water will be killed by the temperature of the water.\"", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I couldn't live without these things. I've got 3 of them and keep them running all the time to add humidity to my apartment. The downside of this vaporizer I've found though is the capacity. It's been dropping to below 0 outside lately, so the air in my apartment has been extremely dry with the heat on. I plug this vaporizer in around 10pm before going to sleep, and I wake up around 3am because it's dry in my apartment. Wondering what's going on, I'll check the vaporizer and it will already be empty. My recommendation is to get one with a water capacity that will at least be able to produce steam more than the 4 hours that this one will. What I've found with this 1.5 gallon vaporizer is that there will still be some water in the reservoir after 4 hours, but only because it doesn't get the last bit of water off the bottom of the reservoir, so it stops producing steam after about 4 hours, and really only steams about a gallon of the water in the reservoir.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "This is the best value for money can buy. It just requires a bit of patience when cleaning it. The more often you clean it, the faster the deposits dissolve. Cleaning TIP: I took a bottle of water ( evian, aberfoyle ) and cut off the top part of the bottle leaving just enough so that the heating part can be fully immerged - sort of making a container to hold the vinegar and salt. Pour the vinegar and a little bit of salt - just enough so that the entire heating element is soaked. Leave it there for a few minutes and voila. The steam is hot when in use, so be careful if you have kids around - that would be the only drawback, but then again, that's why it is called a vapourizer - vapours is supposd to be hot.", "id": "267555011"}

{"review": "We have both this one and the larger Vicks Vaporizer at our house. Both work very well, start steaming right away, last all night without running out of water and have the nice medicine cup that is super-easy to use. My only little problems with this are: 1. The larger model has little indentations to help you lift the steam unit off. This model doesn't, which makes it a little tricky to refill if there is medicine in the medicine cup. 2. Neither model has an on/off switch - it's plugged in and on, or not. It's a little inconvenient to have to unplug it instead of just shutting it off, but for how well it works, I am willing to overlook that. This works so well in fact that when we lent the larger model to my grandmother for her smaller bedroom and when she woke up, everything in the room was a little damp! I used to have a much more expensive model will all the bells and whistles - this one works much better and much easier. A great value!", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "I bought one of these three years ago and a second one a few months ago. One is in our bedroom and other in our daughter's, they both work great. Read the instructions. They explain that you must add salt to the water, the exact amount will depend on your water, but you'll figure it out after a few uses. I add a little shy of 1/4 teaspoon and the humidifier runs quietly from when we go to bed until morning. If I'm heavy handed with the salt then it gurgles a little and it runs out of water before we wake but it's not a big deal. If I was scant on the salt then it puts out less steam. I only have two complaints. One is there is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it to turn it off. Second, there is still an inch or so of water in the reservoir when the water is too low for it to emit steam. The unit works best if you dump this out and start fresh every night. As other reviewers have noted (and as mentioned in the instructions), there are black mineral flecks in the remaining water. I just dump it in the toilet and refill the reservoir (and add salt). It seems all the affordable humidifiers have some convenience flaw. This humidifier is so affordable, these two complaints are so minor I obviously bought a second one. You can't tell from the picture, but you can rotate the blue part to any direction (it houses all the inner workings and vents the steam). It's a super simple design that works. If you find the blue part \"floats,\" then you've over-filled it past the mark on the reservoir. Our apartment is cold and drafty. These humidifiers definitely make the bedrooms feel warmer. It doesn't so much change the air temperature as make the air more comfortable. If you want a fancy humidifier, this isn't it. If you want an inexpensive one that works, consider this one.", "id": "267555011"}

The Nu-Calgon cleaner is a little cheaper than the Scotsman version, so I will probably stick with using it for routine semi-annual cleaning since I have already seen that it works just fine.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "NuCalgon Nickel Safe cleaner removed mineral deposits with ease. After removing the hoses, h20 tray, & cutter rack, I used the product to clean these individual parts. Seconds-not hours after using a small brush to apply the cleaner directly to the parts, the build up of minerals on hard surfaces and bacteria in the tubes were gone. The parts look new. In the future we'll be able to follow the typical, less intensive, use of this product. The 4 star, vs 5 star rating is due to the fact that the product is harsh on skin making gloves necessary. I would prefer to work with a \"friendlier\" product. The instructions say to use gloves and eye protection. Contact with the cleaner, prolonged or not can/will be caustic to your skin. Use it safely, and you won't be dissapointed. This item was delivered very quickly via USPS.", "id": "2399939011"}

{"review": "Have had to return now two of these units, both because of quality control issues, the original and the replacement. The first had a bad bearing in the fan from the moment it was plugged in and was loud enough to hear in next room. I followed all instructions prior to using, including letting refrigerant settle in upright position for over 3 hours. The second had even a louder, shriller, more mechanical noise from the opposite side of unit as the fan, and would have condensation appear on that side while making ice. It was most likely mis-assembled as the original was quieter and did not have that problem. Wanted this to work out and keep, as I 'm tired of buying ice and it's $4 for 20lbs in my area.So I thought I would try. It makes ice fine, the smaller size is pretty much purposeless, about the size of the first knuckle on a pinkie. the larger, the first knuckle of a thumb. It holds one liter of water, which if you use refrigerated water, makes ice even faster. The 26lbs per day would only be possible if you were awake 24 hours as it does need to be refilled and emptied. The ice is wet, as it starts melting as soon it's made. Transferred ice from hopper into bag in freezer for later use and it worked well. Left on overnight and there was ice in AM but nearly all partially melted.

I thought, this would be a great item for parties and I swore if they ever came down in price I was going to own one. Well this one dropped to $100 and I pulled the trigger and bought one and I am glad I did. Every summer I Brew insane amounts of iced tea and I also work outdoors in the heat and need ice to fill my water cooler for work so I am constantly running out of ice. The Ice Maker in the fridge just can't keep up with the demand. The freezer takes 2 hours, this thing takes less than 10 minutes! When I come home from work I fill it up and it runs all night until I go to bed. Each day it produces enough ice for me to keep my summer beverages cool and at the same time make an extra bucket of ice that I use in my water cooler. Here are the only cons I have for this item. 1. before you use it you may want to give it a thorough cleaning with mild detergent.. I gave mine a quick rinse instead of a thorough wash and my first batch of Ice left a plasti-like taste in my beverage when melted. Cleaning it properly before the next use fixed that. 2. It judges the state of the ice by a timer not a thermostat. So 7 minutes for small ice 13 minutes for large (approximately). It takes a while for the chillers to get nice and cold so the first 2 batches or so it makes are pretty lousy little ice balls, but once she gets running up to speed, you'll easily get a pound of ice every hour.

{"review": "The Waring IC70 is a MACHINE! This baby can crush my ice cubes any day. I've found the resulting ice chunks to be perfect for crunching and munching on(I have a compusive ice chewing habit). It is very easy to use, just plug it in, turn on the switch and dump in the ice cubes. It was crushing away on my countertop mere moments after our hottie UPS guy rang the doorbell. Essentially, feed ice cubes into the chute on top and a nice, big plastic bin below receives the lovely crushed output. The stainless steel housing is attractive and understated, but this guy is a little on the large size. Still, I'm willing to give up the counterspace in order to appease my crushed ice needs. I crush roughly 14 ice cube trays worth of ice a day and there is never a hitch. I have had ice cubes get wedged in the chute when I dump a whole tray of ice in at once but this is easily fixed by rocking it gently back and forth. I found this product far superior to the Deni which makes sno-cone style ice and seemed quite rickety compared to the Waring. Also, much less work than the hand-cranked Metrokane Ice Crusher. This Waring IC70 makes great crushed ice for bar drinks: perfect for my amaretto sours and mojitos- even margaritas on the rocks, also great for soft drinks. This does not produce the consistency of ice needed for sno-cones or blended-style drinks.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "I was tempted to buy a less expensive hand ice crusher, but then read some of the disasterous reviews of those, and opted instead for this ice crusher based on most of the positive feedback. Knowing that it would not make \"shaved ice\" before I acquired it has kept my expectations realistic, and it performs exactly as I thought it would, actually better. A friend thought I paid hundreds of dollars for this since it looks very no-nonsense and professional. It crushes the ice into random chunks ranging from pea-sized to marble sized, even though I feed it pretty large cubes from a tray. I have even frozen diet soda in a tray and fed it through to make flavorful \"chewing ice\" since I love to chew on ice. You can eat this \"soda pop ice\" in a cup with a spoon, and it is a lot less caloric than ice cream and satisfies the desire in the summer to eat something ice cold when it is hot outside. However, it is not to be confused with the products you can buy at the convenience store since the chunks of this unit's ice are much larger than those that come out of the \"soft serve\" units commercially found at convenience stores. So if you are looking for shaved ice or \"soft serve\" ice, this is not the one to look at. But if you are just looking to crunch up ice cubes or like to munch on ice, I think this may be the way to go. After seeing what it takes to crunch up the large ice cubes that I feed it, I'm really glad I did not go with a cheaper flimsier manual unit. I'm very happy with the results I have seen from this crusher.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "This product is exactly what I had been wanting - a simple ice crusher that is easy to use. I had been using a blender before, and this is much simpler and also not as loud. It makes somewhat coursely crushed ice (not shaved) that is great for putting in cold drinks. The manual also talks about using it to create ice beds for serving food on (such as shellfish). I guess that would be possible, although I think it would take a long time to make that much crushed ice. It takes around 1 minute to make enough crushed ice to fill an 8-10 oz glass. Also, the machine will occasionally freeze up (no pun intended) if you put in too much ice at once, especially large cubes. If that happens, you have to pour hot water into the top to melt the ice that is stuck.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "The product works, although if you feed it regular size ice cubes from a tray it tends to jam, we learned not to fill up the ice trays to the top. Our unit failed at 13 months, one of the blades started slipping and would get jammed with the ice. I tried to find replacement parts on the Internet, but could not find a source and I suspect that even if I was able to find the replacement blade assembly it would be cost prohibitive. Overall I could not recommend this product as I believe that one year's use for $80.00 is not worth it. Follow up: We purchased a second unit on January 8th of 2009, this one lasted until the second week in March, 2010, roughly 14 months. The unit failed in the same maner as the first one, the middle blade would jam against a piece of ice and it would not turn, it would just slip on the shaft making the machine useless. This is the same type of failure that others here describe; while the unit is operating properly it is great, but it almost seems as if the company was building them to fail shortly after the warranty expires. I plan on contacting Waring to complain, but I am not holding my breath for any positive results. Follow up 01-21-2013 ... another one bites the dust Our latest unit fared better, it lasted 2 years and 10 months; yesterday it failed in the same fashion, the middle blade started slipping rendering the unit useless. I credit this extended longevity to the fact that we have an ice maker that makes smaller ice \"cubes\" and that we are not using it as much as we used to; our schedules have gotten busier and by the time we get home there is not much time or energy left to make smoothies. I just ordered another one, the problem is that there is nothing that comes close to this in the market, the unit works great when it works. Like they say in the movies ....

{"review": "I thought y'all might like a review from someone who's used it for over a year. I've used several ice crushers, mostly hand-cranked, in the past and NONE of them lasted more than 4 months. I've had handles break, crushing mechanisms fall apart, flakes from chrome coatings, even injured my hand rather severly trying to get crushed ice in the past. I am on dialysis and am limited on my fluid intake. Having crushed ice helps keep me from drinking too much (though I LOVE Pepsi in crushed ice!). So crushed ice is pretty much a must for me. My dialysis unit supplies crushed ice but there have been many times their machine was broken and I had to do without - like murder! I also distill my own water for purest water possible so I prefer my \"clean\" ice. So I tried to come up with a crushed ice solution. Now to the point... I finally decided to try an electric crusher, fearing so many stories about how they break down easily, don't crush ice well, clog up, etc. I bought this Waring crusher over a year ago and have used it nearly every day since. Yes, I have had clogs. To me it was no big deal. I learned the clogs were just due to the cube not properly going through the hopper, especially larger cubes - it just needed a nudge or re-positioning with the tip of a fork (I don't recommend fingers). (The unit takes pretty large ice cubes - I just tend to make them too big sometimes). There is no need to put the fork in deep where the blades are so it's okay to do and not a big deal - I recommend doing it with the unit turned off, of course. In any case this occured very rarely as I've learned to drop the cubes into the opening one at a time, even one immediately after the other. So even doing it like that was fast enoutgh - something like 12 cubes in less than half a minute. You could also shake the unit a bit to joggle the cubes around. In the year I may have had to \"declog\" it maybe 20 or 30 times, and as described above, it took nothing to do - no big deal. The ice crushes ideally for crunching, for drinks, or for whatever purpose. It crushes just like the commercial machine at my dialysis unit. I am extremely pleased with it. The fact that it lasted over a year thrills me more than I can explain and it seems to be very reliable. I expect it to last me for years to come. It does take up counter space which I have no problem with, but it also is \"portable\" enough that you can store it in a pantry or set aside when not in use, keeping in mind it is also fairly tall. For a commercial quality ice crusher, though, it really doesn't take up that much space. For me this machine is very convenient - when I want a crushed ice drink, I have the crushed ice in only a few seconds. When I want a lot of crushed ice, I have it in less than a minute. For a huge amount, like a full bin, I'd say it takes maybe 3 or 4 minutes max. Compared to money I've spent on the units that didn't last more than 4 months, the price of this unit is well worth it. $80 (what I spent on the Waring) for years or $30-$40 every 3-4 months. I highly recommend the Waring! Hope this helps in your decision. Happy crushing!", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "I have owned this ice crusher for over a year. I crush ice from my ice maker which makes those half moon shapes. I do this about once a week, crushing up one of those ice maker bins full. This ice maker gets plugged up all the time. It doesn't matter how you load it, it will just stop crushing and you can hear the ice working up and down. You can poke the cubes down with a long plastic spoon and get it crushing again, but sometimes this doesn't even work and you have to pour water through it. When I bought this machine I thought I could pour in the cubes and let the machine do the work. Think again. You have to baby this poorly designed machine along constantly. It's better than putting your cubes in a towel and beating them with a hammer, but not much.", "id": "2399939011"}

{"review": "Now I have only had this up and running for a few days but I am so pleased with this ice maker already. I am an ice eater, who, I must point out to those who are not familiar with us, are picky as hell about the quality of ice we eat. It needs to be small nuggets and it also needs to be \"soft ice\". I know others who would review this product based on its productivity or energy usage, which seem to all be just fine but this is for other ice eaters out there: The size is that of a thimble, and varies as much as thimbles would. The texture of the ice when eaten is like a tightly packed little snow nugget. I think that is due to the fact that the machine is trying to crank out the ice so its not freezing it as sold as an ice cube tray would, its actually a pretty soft ice. I have been filling my cooler (half gallon) and two 24 oz cups about 2-3 times a day to keep up with my consumption and its holding its own just fine. I can't eat faster than it can produce because I would just get too cold anyway but the rate that it produces the ice (9 nuggets every 8 or so minutes) seems to be almost perfect. The machine doesn't keep it cold so you will need to remove the ice as the tray fills up so it will continue producing more ice. If you leave the ice in the tray it will just melt eventually back into the water reservoir and be recycled into new ice if you aren't able to use or remove it in time. Avid ice eaters will spend up to $4000 or more on a machine to get the \"right\" ice, so for those of you who are strapped with this crazy habit and not strapped with a crazy income, this will do the trick for you, no doubt. It has two sizes of cubes to choose from and I just keep it on the smaller size, I still would like it a little smaller but this is definitely do-able. Its not sonic ice, or Orange Julius ice, but for a ice machine with the convenience of at home and always available you won't find better textured ice for the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is concerned about the texture of the ice. I read so many reviews before buying this machine and there is NO information out there on the texture of the actual ice produced. So until you win the lottery or your ship comes in, this is a great low cost counter top machine that produces the right textured ice. Two thumbs up from me!", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "This, by far, is the worst product I've ever purchased. The first one I bought lasted almost a year before it just stopped working. I called the Igloo people and was shocked to find out that they only license their name to be plastered on this flunky product. It's actually made by Curtis Manufacturing. I called just before the warranty period ended and I was instructed by the tech support people in India to \"reset the unit\" by turning the temperature to \"zero\" empty it and unplug it and let it sit for three hours. First, there is NO TEMPERATURE selector knob anywhere! This tech guy didn't know what he was talking about. I did the rest of what he told me, I emptied it and let it sit for three hours... nothing. I let it sit for three days... nothing. It just stopped working. I called them back and went around and around until the point that they offered to replace the unit. I had to send in my receipt and they would send me a claim and procedure for shipping the product back to them. Upon receiving my receipt, they said it was already past a year and there was nothing they could do, the warrany had expired. YES... it expired while I dinked around with them trying to reset it and follow all their instructions and sending my receipt through snail mail. BUT... I had called and lodged my initial complaint DURING the warranty period, but they didn't care about any of that. They refused to help me, so I called Igloo Corporate and lodged a complaint. After all, this piece of junk had the Igloo name on it. I got in touch with the President of Igloo, who was very nice and apologetic about the issue. He made arrangements for me to receive a replacement unit. I thought it was all over with, and that the replacement icemaker would work like a charm. It did.... for three months. The replacement failed just like the previous one. It just stopped working. Period. I called the President of Igloo back again. He finally got tired of dealing with me, so they refunded my money. I told him they should look at the quality of this product and reconsider putting the fine Igloo name on such a dud. It upsets me that we consumers see a \"brand name\" and think \"quality\" and in reality, this is just junk being manufactured overseas. You will find this model with the \"Coldspot\", \"Magic Chef\" and other well known brand names pasted on them. They are the same junk by Curtis Manufacturing. As I've done more and more research, I have found a lot of other complaints about this same model under different brand names. By the way, most of the positive reviews are from folks who just received the product. They haven't owned it long enough to fail yet. I loved it while it worked. It's a good idea, but just poorly manufactured. I just went back to using the icemaker in the freezer of my refrigerator.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "I bought one of these for $89 from the Wal Store a few months back to use in my truck camper during a long trip out west. Since many of the places I go to have no access to ice or it is crazy expensive, I figured what the heck let's see how it works. Well, after 3.5 weeks camping I can say this thing is a marvel. I have a small Dometic 3 way fridge in the camper (almost worthless) and a fairly large Coleman extreme ice chest. Put in 4 gallon jugs of frozen water to the chest. Every night, when we had electricity, I would plug in the Igloo and let it run. I NEVER BOUGHT A SINGLE BAG OF ICE!!! I found that if I dumped the cubes every hour, I could completely fill my ice chest in less than 18 hours of run time. Even my wife, who first made fun of the ice maker, was super impressed. It ran off of my little HF generator, and tried to run off of my crappy 800 watt inverter. I LOVE THIS THING!!!", "id": "2399939011"}

Its just my husband and I and we have never run out of ice. You can leave it going all night and when you get up in the a.m. you have a full basket of ice just in cast you are an iced coffee person.

{"review": "I was a bit hesitant about purchasing a portable ice maker thinking that it probably would not perform that well but I have to say that I was quite wrong in this case. I have owned this product, or one very similar, it would seem that there are many different versions and names placed on the front so who knows who actually manufactures it but mine does say Igloo on the front, for a little over a month and it works like a champ cranking out ice like clockwork. The ice is a little soft coming out of the ice maker so if you are going to use it for drinks I highly recommend that you bag it up and let it harden in the freezer otherwise it melts quite quickly in your drink. Other than that and a little plastic odor when first being used that has since disappeared I have not had any issues with this product, time will tell about its durability but as of this point in time I'm very happy with it.", "id": "2399939011"}

{"review": "The product arrived timely - actually before I expected it. That's a PLUS. As shared in previous reveiws, I was expecting the first few batches of ice to have a plastic taste but that diminished after 5-6 batches. The large ice cubes are perfect size for drinks and I use about 2 Britta pitcher fills for 2 gallon bags of ice to store in the freezer. This unit is NOT a freezer, as indicated in previous posts. The only downside to this machine is when the water is filling for the next freeze, the unit makes a screeching noise which lasts for 2-3 minutes then stops. I banged it on the side and it stopped temporarily but that's not the solution! LOL It's tolerable but annoying since I work from home and the ice maker is within earshot. This unit looks good on my cabinet and is about the size I expected even though dimensions aren't available on Amazon. You have to look it up elsewhere. It's about 12\" wide, 14\" deep and 14\" tall. It weighs in around 20 lbs or so. Except for the screeching noise, I would highly recommend this unit. *UPDATE* It's now March 4th,2011, and the little ice maker is truckin' along. I am very happy with my purchase. The screeching is not as loud - maybe with time it will stop? ~SMILE~ *UPDATE* July 1,2011. Last week, it made one LOUD pathetic SQUAWK, but kept working and the screeching has stopped! YAY! Makes you scratch your head and go \"hmmmmm\". I make ice about once a week and store in gallon baggies for the week - quite convenient. So far, so good. *****I updated from a 4 to a 5 star after the screech stopped. *UPDATE* Well, it's December 23, 2012 and we are still plugging along! The screeching never returned and this product continues to perform very well. It if went \"belly-up\" tomorrow, I would buy another of the same brand as I give it a pretty good workout on a regular basis and am pleased that it's still working.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "This review has always bothered me. I was initially thrilled with the unit and happily gave it a five star review...my icemaker QUIT AFTER ONLY THREE BATCHES OF ICE!!! At that time, it was not possible to change the star rating on a published review. I felt very bad thinking how many people had read my review praising the NewAir and bought one in consequence. After reading the documentation that came with the unit, it was clear that this was a temperamental problem child and pretty much expected to misbehave, and I'd be lucky to ever get one that lasted...and worked. My bad, perhaps, for not going through return and replace, rinse and repeat ad infinitum in the hopes I would get a better unit, but, really, I bought this so I wouldn't have to waste time and energy, twiddling with filling and emptying ice trays, hauling bag ice from the market, or returning broken units over and over again. It seems as though other folks had similar experiences and mine breaking after only three uses??? Figure the odds that the next one would be better. And really do we care how nice they are about shipping out new units or repairing broken ones, if they are? Don't we all want one that works from the start and keeps working??? A good price and free shipping are quickly offset by the hassles of returning and returning and... Off flavor? No, I didn't have that. I believe you were supposed to run a couple batches through before using the ice. I did use bottled water for mine, though, because I am on a well and that water has lots of minerals -- famous for clogging lines, so maybe that's why my ice didn't smell \"off.\" BOTTOM LINE: In my experience, this product is not reliable and is more trouble than it's worth. What a disappointment. From my original review: ADDENDUM: It doesn't freeze and hold the cubes over a period of time, e.g., overnight. However...if you leave it on, the ice will melt and drip back into the water reservoir, starting up the ice making process again...and again. Kind of hard on the energy bills, so bag it and store in the freezer if you don't use it all.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "I received the NewAir Icemaker in Red for Christmas. Once it was unwrapped, I wiped it down, plugged it in, added the water and let it do its thing. It works great! Within 15 minutes, I heard a \"popcorn popping\" sound and realized it was the first batch of ice cubes falling into the \"ice tray\" (and this is the only noise I've heard from the machine). I was pleased with how quickly it produced the ice and how within an hour or so I had to remove the ice from the tray and move it to my freezer so that it could continue to make ice. I was expecting approximately 10 people for Christmas dinner that evening and thought that I was going to have to run out to buy ice for the party, but this little machine produced more than enough ice to get us through the day with our regular drinking and through the dinner party. I should note that I have only been using the machine for about a week now. I do not keep it on constantly as the \"freezing unit\" turns off once the tray is full, so the ice on the bottom will begin melting. The upside is that the ice tray has holes in the botton and the water from the melted ice will drain back down into the water tank (which is probably why the manufacturer recommends draining it daily). Because of this, I run the unit long enough to fill up my ice tray in the freezer (a large one that came with the automatic ice make that no longer works) and then I turn off the machine. Because we typically use a lot of ice, I have only drained the machine once as I tend to use the full water tank full of water when refilling my tray. The ice machine does have 3 ice cube size settings, but I have only used the Large setting based on reviews from users of this and other ice makers. I actually love the large ice cubes as they are similar in size to those cubes in bagged ice, and easily go into my metal water bottle. It's red color is perfect for my kitchen. It blends well with my other red small kitchen appliances which include Kenmore, KitchenAid, Cuisinart, Keurig, and Oster reds. They're not all the same shade of red, but they all compliment one another as does this machine. It's compact size is also a bonus as it does not require much counter space. While it is a solid machine, it is not so heavy as to make it too difficult to move from the counter to the sink to drain the water tank. Overall, I'm in love. The pros (function, production, color, size, quiet) are much greater than it's con (ice melts when tray is full). I would recommend this unit to a friend looking for a compact ice maker.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "I had never owned an ice maker before, only the kind that comes in your freezer. But we needed to get Dad something for his birthday, so we wanted to get him an ice maker because it is so hot in the summers. I read all the reviews for nearly every ice maker on Amazon and worried a lot about making the wrong choice. Finally, based on percentage of highest 4-5 start reviews, I chose this one. At first, the ice tasted like pastic, but after I ran it through a couple of cycles with vinegar, the plastic taste went away. The ice maker makes 3 sized ice cubes: Small, Medium and Large. Large is slightly smaller than ice cubes from the store: about the size of your thumb and index finger combined. Small is the size of your index finger, while medium is the size of your thumb. After running a few cycles on LARGE ice cube cycle, the cubes get larger and larger as the ice cube maker gets colder. The machine is SUUPER easy to use. My Mom and Aunt (who can barely use a computer) both figured it out WITHOUT instructions or anyone showing them! Amazing! I would definitely recommend this unit. We are all SOOO happy with it! My aunt is going to use the ice from it for icing her knee after surgery and we all enjoy ice with our water every single day. Everyone raved about how this was such a GREAT choice for Dad's birthday - they were all shocked at how much even they loved it! I am so happy we risked an ice maker!

{"review": "Received the machine today, in its original box set in a larger box with corner bumpers. No box damage at all. I wiped it out, washed the tray & scoop, filled it and within 15 minutes it dropped two makings with no noticeable smell. The cubes are not as large as hoped, but just fine as is. I don't think it is very noisy, but my ears are old! The color is like the cinnamon color of our counter mixer; both units compliment each other and sure brighten the kitchen. With 2 day shipping from Prime and the great price, buy it, you will enjoy! Update 12/21/2012: Well, as with some other reviews here, I am sorry to say the machine has died. It will still make ice; however, the gearing that moves the water tray has frozen and will not move. Sad that it is only several months out of warranty. I will call NewAir and see if they will make this right. If not, we will not buy any of their makers, but go with a more expensive one. We had hoped this little unit would last at least 4-5 years. Maybe I will attempt to remove the casing and see if I can get the gearing apparatus to release. UPDATE: 01/15/2013: I removed the back and top covers finding the drive motor had a rusted/frozen shaft. There was no grommet/o-ring sealing the shaft from moisture exposure. Therefore, nature took its course and moisture did its job. Sad reflection on the maker of these units that they could not better protect the motor and shaft. Guaranteed shaft freeze down the road. The next saddest thing is I called New Air and tried to order a replacement motor; I was told that they had to check if they could get one and would email me with info. After 24 hours and no reply, I searched and found the part on Magic Chef's parts order site and then verified the motor type with Magic Chef: [...]. Seems that many different ice makers are made by the same company and under many different brands. The part w/shipping was $35.90.

{"review": "I bought this NewAir AI-100R portable Ice Maker in March 2011 as a birthday gift to my husband. He likes to drink an ice water or ice with juice all the time. At the very first couple times of using that icemaker, I had to spill the newly made ice cylinders, because they smelled like plastic, but after that we did not have any problem with the taste of the ice. In 1 month after I bought the ices maker, we had some important family event and had to have a constant flow of the people in the apartment. For a week we had about 60-80 visiting people per day. For all that time my new Ice maker was working and making ice non-stop from 7:00 AM till 11:00 PM. I was really glad that I was able to make enough ice for all our visitors and was proud to demonstrate them my new ice maker. And I think that I saved so much money by making my own ice instead of buying it at the supermarket! Ice maker was working fine every time I need some ice since I bought it (for 9 months already). If you have guests, you just have to start making ice in advance and store fresh ice in the freezer. I use clean plastic bags to store fresh ice. If you are expecting a large group of people, it is better to start making ice a day before the event to store enough. Ice maker makes some noise, but it is mild and does not bother anyone. The freshly made ice is wet, and it sticks to each other at the freezer. I have a habit to stir ice cubes in the plastic bag to separate them from each other after it was sitting in the freezer for 15-20 min. At the hot summer time, when you start ice maker after it was off for certain amount of time, the 1st portion of the ice cylinders will be very wet, thin and flimsy and it is better to dump it back to the water tank. After that there is no problem. Minor inconvenience is that even though machine has a red light on to indicate that there is no more water at the water tank, there are always some water left at the water tank. I always must spill out unused water. The removal of the water is done by the little pipe at the bottom of the ice maker that has covered by a metal cap (attached to the machine) and a little tiny plastic plug (unattached to anything and very easy to drop). If you will loose that tiny plug, then you will have a big problem. Better to be careful and do not drop and loose it. We love our ice maker and its red color adds a cheerful atmosphere to my kitchen.", "id": "2399939011"}

{"review": "The good: FAST ice, quiet, compact. Handy. The Bad #1 WET SOFT ICE, melts back to water, (ice maker not a freezer). My solution.. In the back of manual found customer service email address phone, I ordered 2 extra baskets, had to 'mail' a paper check and mail the order in, how quaint, but they were very reasonable and arrived in 10 days. now I keep 2 baskets in my freezer door and 1 in the machine, and rotate. The bad #2 IT BREAKS (ours lasted 9 months, better than most) My solution.. Figured out how to fix it. Not worth repairing, so nothing to loose by taking it apart. The culprit (at least in MY case) was the fan inside wasn't always coming on, so compressor overheats, shuts down right away. Used Philips head screwdriver, took back off, fan just a standard 12 volt computer case fan,(120 mm 2000 RPM,). Ordered one for <$10 and replaced dead one and it makes ice again. The little plugs were different, just had to clip the fan wires (red and black) from little plugs, splice wire, and tape (make sure air is blowing outwards from case, if not turn fan around it can go either way). Also had to find some longer screws from junk drawer, only found 2, but seems fine 1 in each corner!

{"review": "I researched a lot of ice machines & a lot of customer reviews before realizing that most machines are loud and produce somewhat small and wet ice. The machines aren't good for storing the ice, just making it, and good luck in finding a machine that will have good capacity without breaking down on you shortly after arrival (if it doesn't already arrive broken). I finally chose one based on its looks, figuring I had nothing to lose. Boy, was I lucky because I'm extremely happy with this device. It makes ice very quietly. You can hear the machine is on, but you don't notice it in the background. The ice is not extremely frozen when done, but immediately tranferring it to the freezer totally and completely remedies this. The bin is larger than expected, and is about the capacity of . . . imagine a loaf of bread. Cut off about five slices. Maybe six. This is the tray , though it's a bit thicker than a regular loaf. Just a visual. I wish I had one beforehand, I had no idea what to expect. I'm extremely happy with this product. If you are reading reviews for ice makers, then you are obviously in the market. Here is a tip my mother taught me: get a ziplock bag and fill it up with the ice to put in your freezer. That is the best way to store the ice. That way when it's time to get the ice, if any stick together (which for the most part, they do not for me) you can just drop the ziplock on the counter and they will immediately crack apart.

{"review": "Got mine through Ebay on a Make Offer Price,came from Santa Ana,CA by FedEx in a Box-Within-a-Box. Nicely protected with White Foam inserts x2 and also rubber-like foam x4 Dark Gray/Black pieces. At first i wasn't to impressed with this but my tune soon changed with what it can do. This is like a little factory in the machine if you watch it. Like watching a mini-assembly line at work. Works like a looming machine that you might see down south or a try your luck gambling game and a scoop shovel operator. What happens is you have these 9 steel spikes hanging down that the ice collects around. I thought at first the ice came up through the bottom into the ice basket through the holes,nope. I put my water in just right below the Max Fill Line with the Ice Basket/Container out. Then i put the Ice Basket back in and plugged it in and waited and watched. You have 2 Green Lights lit at start of cycle and they are Power On and Select Size. I mostly watched and listened as the cycle was doing what it was destined for,a little noisy but not bad. Water rose up ½ way on the 9 spikes,it's like someone opened up the flood gates and the water started to rush-in. No water leaks with this machine either so i'm impressed with that. The ice was starting to form on the spikes from the bottom working up to the ½ mark on the spikes. After Compressor kicked in then Fan also kicked in a few seconds later,i thought this is going to take some time. And i was right but it sure filled-up my freezer ice container that i have,had to empty the machine ice basket 2 times to completely fill-up my freezer container,sure beats filling-up ice trays all the time. This gave me 2 machine baskets of ice,234 cubes,i got 117 cubes in each basket,cycle time is a little over 8 minutes. It took 13 dumps times 9 cubes each to fill the machine ice basket. And when you throw these into the freezer after a while they stick and cluster together,THEIR WET,another minor inconvenience. Just bang your freezer container to separate them,the ice is good tasting,i used our tap water which is excellent in this area. The small size ice had a Center Hole in the cube,cube size is the size of a large thimble,not much difference in the Large Size either. Finally at the end of the cycle which is S-L-O-W movin',plastic scoop tray which is at the top begins to sweep back then ice fall onto the plastic platform and the scoop sweeps forward from it's backward position scooping all 9 cubes onto it. Scoop is rising up to meet the ice basket and dumps the cubes in. You get a Red Light that comes on when the basket is full and also when you have to add water. It is really fascinating to watch this cycle through. Also there is a plastic drain plug underneath the front part of this unit when you want to drain the water from reservoir. Would i buy this again? Yes i would and i also recommend this mochine especially if you are an Ice-Eater or just want to use for your drinks.", "id": "2399939011"}

First off, the shipment did arrive on time and was very nicely double-boxed. The machine itself appears to be well built and runs quietly. It should last for many years. I couldn't wait to start making ice! It took 10 minutes for the first batch to freeze and when they dropped into the bin my jaw also dropped. The ice \"cubes\" are about the size of a thimble and only 9 ice thimbles are made per batch. By the time the second batch came out, the ice thimbles from the first batch were nearly completely melted. After leaving the machine run for an hour, the cycle time did drop down to 6-7 minutes because the melting ice thimbles were pre-cooling the water. Based upon my experience, the ice maker would work well for an office or perhaps as a supplement to your refrigerator's ice maker during high demand periods.

Ice cubes are not solid they have round hole in center(due to cooling freezing rod system) it makes about 5-8 oz.ice every 5 minutes (fast) comes with little plastic ice scoop. has a back drain plug for cleaning. it shows solid green light while on and making ice. it has two red light modes; one to let you know ice tray is full,other one is low water indicator. Because the unit itself is not a freezer,if you forget to unload full ice cube tray,the ice will start to melt.But don't worry,they engineered it this way,for water simply goes (falls) back to water tray under it and as soon as enough ice melts it triggers a switch and new batch off making ice.

{"review": "First impressions - good shipping package and no damage. Nice looking machine that looks good and appears to be capable. Pros - I like the steel skin that the ice maker is wrapped in, gives a nice professional look. Also like the finish to the dark top section, nice viewing window, and overall good looking machine. Like the position of the two carry handles, makes it well balanced to carry. Made my first batch of large ice cubes last night, very impressed with results. You have three sizes to choose from, not sure if I would use the two smaller sizes as they are not very big to begin with. Put some in a large glass with room temperature water, and it was cold pretty quick. The cubes lasted longer than I thought they would, they are solid and not soft or mushy. Cons - fit and finish of the control panel, it doesn't sit flat against the steel skin, it appears to have been glued in place and doesn't match the rest of the machine quality. Plastic scoop is kind of flimsy and wonder how it will hold up, I may replace it with an aluminum one. No other complaints yet... Comments - I strongly recommend reading the manual first (I usually just skim through them), I found advice near the back page that suggests using the \"self-clean\" feature before using it the first time. They say to mix water & vinegar 1/2 & 1/2. I would have never known to do this if I hadn't seen it. Looking forward to saving the money our home has spent on store bought ice for years. We spend about $300/yr buying ice, so it will take us less than one yr to make our money back. Looks like a good investment so far.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "I purchased this ice maker two months ago because the underperforming ice maker in our Samsung fridge just couldn't supply the ice needed for our kids sporting events. We have been very pleased with quantity and quality of the ice produced by the Newair AI-215 ice maker. It is a larger unit so it is not something we normally leave on the countertop. We typically fire it up one night a week and, after a few hours, we have bagged all the ice we need for the coming week. A few suggestions for those purchasing the machine: 1) As others suggested, please read D. Fowler's helpful review under the red model listing for detailed cleaning instructions; 2) Once you clean the ice maker, initially leave the lid open between uses whenever possible to air out that \"new ice maker\" smell; and 3) If you like clear cubes buy a filtration pitcher. I initially used filtered water directly from the fridge but then decided to buy a filtration pitcher and immediately noticed the cubes came out clear. I bought the ZeroWater 10-cup pitcher from Amazon.", "id": "2399939011"}

{"review": "Got this machine two days ago. It is great AND it is horrific. First, the great. It is easy to use and make s a lot of ice. Based on my research, this portable, table top ice maker makes more ice per day (50 lbs) than any other portable, table top ice maker on the market. The instructions are very clear, and if you need to call customer service for a question, they are pretty easy to reach and fairly responsive. Now for the bad part. The display is terrible ( and that is being kind). The display is and LCD -- not an LED. There is no backlight, so the display is hard/impossible to read in both sunlight and darkness. We spend several seconds trying to get a good angle so we can see the display. We even have a flashlight next to the unit. When the unit is low on water or is over filled on ice, an icon is put on the LCD display. However, it is impossible to see from a distance.......and very difficult to see from even very close to the unit. Why, oh why, didn't the manufacturer just put two colored LEDs that would come on and signify low water and high ice. The push buttons on the display aren't. You read that right. The buttons don't push in; rather, all you do is simply touch them. This is kind of like your iPad screen. The difference here is that you can accidentally brush one of your fingers or your Palm in front of the display and, for example, the machine will turn off, or you will start the timer. This, to me is really, cheap. Why, or why, didn't the manufacturer put \"real\" positive action switches on the unit. So, the unit runs great.....produces a lot of wonderful ice.......but is a royal pain to use.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "This is now the send unit in five months that is failing. The first lasted less than three months before the water pump failed. I returned it to the manufacturer at my expense, and after trying to tell me the failure was my fault they finally repaired the unit. I received it a full month after shipping it in for service and when I plugged it in it had the same exact problem. At that point I called Amazon who replaced the unit with a new one (great customer service!). I have had the new unit only about three weeks and the water pump is failing again. I have run the self cleaning cycle about 40 times and it still doesn't produce enough pressure to fill the ice making basket. I will be calling Amazon again. Long story short, I paid more for this unit as it had the greatest per day capacity of the models offered and I had similar problems with the 33lb units that I thought this upgraded model might fix. It seems to be the opposite. The other models all lasted at least six months before they failed and it was usually the gear drive that rotates the ice basket. The parts are made of plastic and are not made to hold up to regular use. I have been very disappointed with both NewAir's product quality and their customer service. I am considering investing in one of those built I models that goes under a counter like a dishwasher as our family uses a good amount of ice per day and we need something to supplement our refrigerator ice maker.

{"review": "The rental house I am in doesn't have an ice maker in the refrigerator. It was the best choice out of all the rentals I looked at the last time I moved and since I don't use ice every day, I decided it was something I could easily live without. I started out using bags of ice from the store, which works OK. Then I decided that it would be nice to have an icemaker in the house, so I looked at portable ice makers. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to run a water line to where the refrigerator is and really don't want to go to that much trouble since I do rent this house. A portable ice maker is easy to set up and can go with me when I move. Having had an excellent experience with the NewAir AIC-210 Commercial Grade 1 Quart Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker, I put the NewAir brand at the top of my list when I looked at portable ice makers. I finally settled on the Newair AI-215SS Stainless Steel Portable Ice Maker with 50 Lbs. Daily Capacity because I liked its features and I liked it's high daily capacity. The unit has a self-cleaning cycle, which I very much appreciate. My sister used to have a portable ice maker, but it did not self-clean and she said it was really difficult to do manually with her model (I don't know what brand she had.) I put the self-cleaning cycle on, using the manual's recommended solution of one part water to one part white vinegar. After running it through a cleaning cycle with the vinegar solution, I ran a cycle with clear water to `rinse' it. The procedure is very similar to using a vinegar solution to clean a coffeemaker. After both the vinegar solution cycle and the fresh water cycle, I set the appliance on the edge of the kitchen sink, aiming the drain plug to empty the unit into the sink. At the end, I had to tilt the ice maker a little to get the last of the liquid out. Draining it might be a little easier if the drain plug were placed underneath the unit, but I'm not sure if that is mechanically feasible. Still, it wasn't hard to drain it, although I do think there is room for improvement. Once it had been freshly cleaned, I filled it with fresh water and set it to make medium-sized ice cubes. The window on the top lid allows you to watch it make ice cubes, which is only exciting for about a minute. Mostly it is nice to simply see what stage the cycle is in. The ice maker comes with a basket to catch the ice in after it has made, and an ice scoop for serving it. Both of these items can be run through the dishwasher on the top rack, but they were also very easy to hand wash. I filled a couple of large zip style bags with ice ( Hefty One Zip 2.5 Gallon Jumbo Bags 16ct (pack of 2)) and stored one in the upright freezer in the garage and the other in the kitchen freezer for serving. The bags are easy to handle and can be zipped up to protect the ice. I also like that I can write the date I made the ice on the bags. The maker produces bullet-shaped `cubes' that fit nicely in most glasses and work wonderfully in most drinks. You can use this maker during parties if you want to keep ice going throughout the party rather than make a few batches beforehand. While this machine does make ice cubes, it does not keep them frozen after it has made them. However, as the ice melts in the basket, holes in the basket allow the water to drain back into the water reservoir, recycling it to make another batch of ice bullets. I am very pleased with this ice maker. It does everything I want and has proven very reliable so far. The only thing that would make it easier to make ice would be if it could be connected to a water line, but I really didn't want that feature because it would have required an installation I'd need help with. With the AI-215SS, I was able to unbox it and go with no assistance from anyone.", "id": "2399939011"}
{"review": "When I was a visual merchandiser for a retail store, I used a professional steamer nearly every day. I purchased this steamer based on price and user reviews. So far it has lived up to my expectations. It heats up quickly and I can get several garments done before I run out of water. Besides being lighter and made of plastic, it performs very similarly to professional grade (which cost 4 times as much). Two minor problems I have with this steamer - there are no brakes on the wheels so the steamer slides around while I'm steaming, and the telescoping pole isn't quite high enough for my taste. Most of the time I hang my garment on something else. Like with any steamer, it takes a little practice to really get good at it. A pointer for those new to steaming - place the steamer head on the inside of your garment pushing steam from inside to out. It's easier for you to handle everything that way (rather than steaming from the outside of the garment). Plus, I save a lot of steam burns by working this way!", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I did a lot of research before buying this one. The other price points (unless the super professional grades) don't add much more feature, more like a bigger water tank. 45 minutes of steam is enough for me, as my arm was sore after 30 minutes or less. :( Pros: steams up really fast (< 1min), no drips. works well. The trick is to sweep the wand *SLOWLY*, instead of rapid back-and-forth motion. And I find that putting the wand with the brush INSIDE the shirt, and pulling it out & upwards gives you more tension in the fabric and thus makes it smoother and crispier, more than just taking the wrinkles out if you just do it from the outside. Heavier cotton requires more work. Cons: The pole is still too short (but others are of same height). So for longer clothing, you have to stoop down to get to the bottom hem. The pole is steady, just wobbles slight from all the tugging, but that doesn't bothers me. The problem is the hanger will wobble and twist a whole lot more and thus making steaming process a bit harder. Caveats: some wrinkles may return if you don't do enough(same with using the iron). And also, the clothes can wrinkle when slightly damp from the steaming. So hang them carefully afterwards. Overall I like it much better than an iron, and much safer. You may still get slight burn from the steam if not careful, but nowhere close to touching a hot piece of iron. All this is just from my first use after reading all the tips in other reviews. I can only get better with practice. Highly recommend! EDIT: This portion is an update after one year of use. The steamer had clogged up a few times (no steam coming out after 1-2 minutes). It turns out, there was mineral build-up from my using regular tap water (vs distilled water). I had to give it a thorough clean & rinse thru to get all the yucky brown & black residues out. Make sure to flush out all the mineral deposits. I also recommend that you empty out all the water if you don't plan on using it for days. Not just the tank, but where the water pools at the bottom of the unit. Keep it dry if not in use.", "id": "510240"}

You do not have to hold a steam button like many other units. You just turn the switch on and you are steaming in 30 seconds. It is half the size of the SF-465 so its easy to store in the laundry room and I love the fact that the water tank pops out easily for refill.

{"review": "I put it together quickly and with no problems. I heated up in about 30 seconds. I puts out a nice, even flow of very hot steam. The wide steam head it a plus. I just road tested this steamer on a pair of wool dress pants, a cotton shirt and a linen blend skirt. I attempted to put the crease back into the wool pants using this steamer instead of my iron or steam press (also a SteamFast) because of the shine they leave on dry cleaned wool and found this is going to take practice. The steamer removed the wrinkles beautifully but they were not that many to begin with. I started with the pants hanging up on the attached garment hanger but put the pants on the ironing board and was able to get a crease, but not as perfect as I can with the iron. But again, with practice I think I will be able to with this steamer. My cotton shirt was very badly wrinkled. The steamer again performed beautifully. While it did not impart a crisp starched looking pressing like an iron will, it did remove all but the very worst wrinkles at the hem. To finish, I again put the shirt on the ironing board and removed them. I also was able to get the collar nice and pressed looking, too. The moment of truth was the linen blend skirt. You know how linen gets. This was skirt was air dried from the wash and was a skirt shar pei. Add to that, this is a tailored skirt with a buttoned vent. A serious pain in the behind to press. This is where the steamer would have gotten five stars from me - it got this skirt work ready and much, much faster and easier than had I used the iron. I was seriously impressed. I did not have any problems with water drips except the 2 or 3 I got when I laid the pants flat on the ironing board. None with them hanging on the stand on the unit. And none after that. The loss of a star is for the hose. It gets very hot and nowhere do they mention that in the instructions (but I did see that in a review here). I had to maneuver around it for fear of burning myself and that was distracting/cut my efficiency. I tried using the heat pad that comes with the unit but found it too awkward so I just used my hands. Barely burn myself a couple of times, and not at all after a few passes (once I got the feel of the weight of the steam head and direction of the steam). With the caveat of not having tested this on silk, I do recommend this steamer. It passed it's first test with me with flying colors.", "id": "510240"}

{"review": "I am so impressed with this simple inexpensive iron! A little history here...I am a quilter and I use my steam iron daily for hours! :) 1. I have been the owner of two Mini Rowenta's irons that both spit and wet my ironing board, in puddles, when I wasn't looking. I followed the directions but they continued to spit with out mercy! They were never dropped, one still works as a dry iron so not too bad a value if you don't use steam...but I do! :/ 2. I have owned an Oliso iron with the cool feet that raise the iron up and down and it only lasted only 1 1/2 years at a cost of $85. I also followed all the directions on this iron and it too was never dropped. The feet never failed me on the Oliso but the steam was not very good and it too spit really bad. Although, I loved the up and down feet in the horizontal mode at the cost of $85. and only lasting 18 months is about $5.00 a month expense for an iron. Not my idea of a good value. 3. I need a super hot iron with a super good horizontal steam to get the cotton wrinkles out. So, when the Oliso died unexpectedly I had to pull out my old back up iron that cuts off when I don't use it for 8 min. Really! How annoying for the quilter like me to have to jump up and jiggle the iron every few minutes, plus wait on it to heat up again if I forget. Not to mention that my old stand buy will even cut off if I iron for more than 30 seconds with out lifting the iron. Ugh!!! 4. So I Googled the worlds best cheap iron and found this sweet little Panasonic iron! I love it! It gets super hot and has powerful steam in the horizontal position only. But that is so perfect as I iron for more than 30 seconds a lot when I iron out a backing of 9 or 10 yards of fabric. It has the old fashioned turning wheel knob to turn it on and set the temperature. A little light comes on at the base of the handle and in less than 2 minutes it reaches the set temperature and the light goes out. As the iron has to heat up the light comes on again but I don't even notice that I am so happy with the temp and steam! The water tank is see through on this Panasonic...my old stand by you have to guess where the water line is. It doesn't have the auto shut off safety feature...this is great! I have a theory that the auto safety feature is what kills the steam feature and kills the iron eventually for an avid quilter like me under constant use. 5. So to sum it all up, this Panasonic iron gets really hot and stays hot! This iron is easy to fill with tap water and the water lasts all afternoon for me. There is no auto shut off safety feature...perfect! The price is only $19.99 averaged over 18 months of heavy use at a cost of $1.11 a month... I ordered a second one to put up for the future today! :) 6. FYI this Panasonic does not have the auto wind up cord that some of the other Panasonic models do...but I never put my iron up so again PERFECT! 7. Also, always unplug irons and sewing machines when you leave your sewing room, as Featherweight and old Singer machines keep constant electric current flowing to them even when the light is turned off.

{"review": "I originally wanted to get the NI-S300TR but saw just below the image that there was another newer version called the Panasonic NI-E300TR U-Shape Steam Iron. So I clicked on the newer version and liked the features. Then right next to the image was a selection of colors. Not being a fan of lime green, I selected the blue color instead. I had no idea that the different colors meant completely different features. Had I scrolled down to the bottom of the page, I would have seen that color selection was tied to what features came with the iron. Each color had different features - which was not indicated when it indicated that I could select the color iron that I wanted. When my blue iron arrived with the instruction booklet, it was then that I learned that my iron had fewer features than the other two color selections of lime-green and violet (with violet having the most features). According to the manual that came with my iron - the manual was for the NI-E650TR and also covered the features for the E300TR and E200T. The blue version does not have a retractable cord, no self-cleaning feature, no vertical steam, no automatic shut-off, no stay-clean vents and no \"jet of steam\" feature. So PLEASE BE AWARE when selecting your color choice. It isn't so much the color that you are selecting as it is a completely different model with different features. That should have been made more clear. I paid $1 more and have none of the features that I thought I was getting. If I would have saved that dollar, I could have had a lot more features. Go figure.

{"review": "I researched carefully before buying another iron. E-How provided insights, and I read reviews of the best irons. A good steam iron should have at least 300 steam holes, my sources told me, and 1700 watts of power. This Rowenta has 400 steam holes, a smooth gliding sole plate with specially designed tip to get around buttons. This is an update of the Focus DZ 5080, but probably pretty much the same. It seems that irons have gotten more expensive over the years, but cheaper in manufacturing and quality. I was so tired of my Black & Decker spitting brownish liquid onto my clothes, dripping, cooling instead of steaming. I actually like ironing, but need a tool that works. The Rowenta Dw5080 is great -what a real steam iron should be. The first time I filled it it really gave off steam, has a nice feel, good weight, and glides easily. Heavy cotton fabric, which used to take several passes, now takes one and looks perfectly smooth. All of the functions are easy to see and use and it has a large water tank. It does use up water, but so did my old B&D. The difference is, this one really gives off steam. One note on filling it: if you get little white flakes, your water is too hard, so add 50/50 with spring water (not distilled), and be faithful about using the self-clean feature once a month. So far, I just love this iron and look forward to ironing with new delight. I hope it lasts a long time. I am tired of buying poor quality products that end up in landfills.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I work at a huge corporate facility and have to use an iron often, sometimes daily. Having freshly pressed clothes is something I take pride in and ironing is so much cheaper then taking your clothes to the dry cleaner (plus the chemicals they use....blech). Back when I was living with roommates one of them had a nice Rowenta iron. That iron was such a work horse it put my old B&D iron to shame. I was sad when we all parted ways and got places of our own because I had to give up use of such a great iron. So here we are a year and change later and boom my old B&D iron I started using again began to leak which was the final blow to the problems I started having with that iron. I was actually happy about this because I was eager to finally get a Rowenta of my own. The reason I chose this iron is because of the look and size. I'm a 6'5\" male with pretty big hands so I like the fact that the handle has a nice sturdy feel to it and the steam and squirt buttons are big. The weight of the iron is good; makes you feel like you have something sturdy in your hands, something that will last you a while if taken care of. Performance is astounding. The iron glides across your clothes and the bursts of steam are even on every pass. As soon as I got home I followed the first use instructions and went to work on a basket of dress shirts and slacks I had just washed. What I noticed immediately is that my ironing time was cut in half. With my old iron it would take more then a few minutes to get warmed up and when finally warm I would have to make several passes to get that nice ironed shirt look I enjoy. With the Rowenta, it takes about a minute or two to warm up then the magic that can only be found using a Rowenta happens. This iron ate through a whole basket of dress clothes in less then half the time it would have taken with my old iron. With my old iron ironing a full basket of clothes was more like a project that I had to set aside time for but now that I have this Rowenta in my stable ironing that same basket of clothes has been reduced back down to a simple chore that only takes a few minutes to complete. Take it from someone who irons on a regular basis...you can't miss with this purchase. Save yourself a whole lot of time and frustration. When it comes to buying an iron, don't buy cheap, buy Rowenta. EDIT: Been almost a year now and this baby is still going strong. If you haven't bought one already and you're looking for a great iron trust me, it's worth the extra coin.", "id": "510240"}

(would not power up when plugged in) After several calls, including to Rowenta North America, I determined that it was the plug itself that was likely broken or defective. I contacted the Rowenta service center in Seattle, WA. to learn that a new plug costs $39.95 plus $20.00 to install the part. (plus shipping of about $20.00 for a total of($79.95) I informed the individual at the Rowenta service center that I am fairly handy with electronics and asked if, in his opinion, he thought I could install the part myself,....He replied with one word, no. So I went back to Bed, Bath & Beyond and told the story to the Manager who could not have been more understanding. He gave me a brand new Rowenta Focus model DW-5080. To my surprise Rowenta has changed the design of this iron enough so that it should no longer carry the designation \"Focus,\" or the model designation DW-5080. The new Focus DW-5080 spit out large quantities of water from the steam vents every time I used it. Wanting to give it some break in time I varied the amount of water I put in the tank, tried to use a lower or higher heat setting, and it continued to spit large amounts of water from the steam vents. I called Rowneta North America and from my conversation with them I have no doubt that Rowenta is well aware of this issue as well as leaking water tanks and faulty electronics that cause their irons to shut off intermittently. (Overall poor quality control with their products.) After two weeks I took this model back and spent extra to try the next model up, a DW-8080 \"Pro Master.\" Looking over the reviews I can see that others have experienced the same issue(s) I've experienced with my Focus, (DW-5080) as well as with the Pro master,(DW-8080) (most of their product line of irons) Bottom line: DO NOT purchase a Rowenta iron unless it's from a retailer like Bed, Bath & Beyond who will allow you to return the product back to the store you purchased it from. If I had purchased this product over the internet I would not have had the resolve to spend the time and money to try to return Rowneta's defective products. Rowenta spent years establishing a reputation for quality, if expensive, products. The newer Rowenta products are simply hit or miss in terms of quality. BEWARE!", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "This is my third Rowenta Iron and I love it. It has plenty of well dispersed steam holes and I really like the shape of the sole plate head- great for around button holes and small areas. Produces plenty of steam even for terribly wrinkled linen. Use bottled spring water and you won't have any problem with the iron spitting. It's not a light iron, but a good iron must have some weight to it. I do wish the Rowentas had an on/off switch but I'm guessing this is a safety issue. Once you go Rowenta, you won't go back. I've passed my older Rowentas to my college age children and they're still working. The cleaning kit is also a good purchase- the cream cleaner works well.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Rowenta has disappointed me. I bought this iron 9 months ago. Worked great, then suddenly without provocation or cause it started leaking and THAT is an understatement. A river runs through it, is more like it. I use the steam function often but it doesn't matter. Steam or spray when I begin to iron, water RUNS out of the bottom holes and the heel, staining the clothes I'm ironing. And water from an iron stains such that the item has to be re washed. I have maintained and cleaned the iron, so there is no reason for this. Yes, I know sometimes you get a lemon however I purchased a different model Rowenta iron 14 months ago and the same thing has happened; the leaking isn't as bad but I'm going to have to replace that one soon. Planned obsolescence is fine but having to buy an ANNUAL iron at this price? Uuh, I don't think so. I have purchased Rowenta irons for over 20 years and have had no problem. Their website? Awful. When you attempt to communicate via email the contact us form does not scroll all the way down. I tried 2 diff browsers. So frustrating. I now need an iron and I have no idea what to buy but Rowenta is O-U-T! Maybe you have to get in at the $200 price point to get a decent everyday iron. When that happens pigs will fly and Hell will serve snow cones! Ugh.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I have had this model since June 7th. It was incredible for two weeks. Then it started shutting off while I was using it. I could not iron one of my dress shirts completely without it shutting off. I began to unplug it, wait and then plug it back in and let it heat up and start over. This got old really quick. I am currently dealing with customer service. I was really very excited about this purchase and I am very disappointed in the performance. I should note that I did see a few negative reviews but I thought that those people were just being really picky or hard to please. I am not sure if I will try another Rowenta or not. We will see how customer service handles this problem. I hope there is an easy solution. PS. I do not think I am using to high of a setting for the fabric type.", "id": "510240"}

I don't know what the magic trick is, maybe I got a lemon. But it can't stay hot enough to make the water into steam so it is getting returned tomorrow.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "This was my second Rowenta DW5080 Focus (made in Germany). Both discharged water like a fire hydrant. After Niagara Falls on the very first occasion of both irons, I ran the self-cleaning cycle twice. Using the irons the second time was worse. Foul brown water everywhere--on the clothing, the ironing board, and the floor. Before you purchase this thing I would recommend that you explore an antique coal-heated model. The Rowenta Focus attempts 1 and 2 are perhaps the worst consumer products I've ever had the misfortune of using. I've been ironing for 40 years, and this the most hideous steam iron adventure I've even heard of.", "id": "510240"}

My bathroom shines, all my applicances look brand new and this actually got the stains out of my acrylic kitchen sink all with very little \"elbow grease.\" I have a glass top stove and this cleaned up all the burned on stains. This has awesome power, does not drip and can even be refilled as soon as it runs out of water. There is no warranty with this product and that concerned me at first. I contacted the company via email asking about replacement parts should I ever need them and was told that parts are available.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "This steamer is awesome! It heats up fast and the steam is hot enough to do a good job on many tasks. I originally bought it to help get rid of a minor bed bug problem (which it did) but then used it to clean my ceramic cooktop stove; steam wrinkled curtains smooth while on the rod (because ironing is not fun but steaming is); and getting fold creases out of my winter sweaters. I constantly think of new uses for this steamer. It's fairly compact and although it holds only about 6 oz. of water, the steam lasts for about 15 to 20 minutes before I have to refill. Usually, whatever job I'm working on doesn't even take that long.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Length:: 8:59 Mins This is a nice product and it comes with a lot of accessories and tools. Cleaning with steam is a nice way to remove tough stains, grease and sanitize and sterilize the surfaces at the same time. I recommend that you use distilled water in this tool to prolong its life and prevent the buildup of calcium and minerals on the heating elements. The unit is fast and easy to use and the steam was ready to use in 3 to 5 minutes as promised. Using steam is a great way to remove some of those hard to clean stains and built up grease and while you clean you are sanitizing the areas because of the hot steam temperature. Just be careful as there are some things that you should consider when using steam to clean and you have to do it safely. I included a video to help you understand the potential risky areas and how to remove and seal the lid and attach the accessory tools to the unit. The power cord is 12 feet long and it lets you work in a large area without relocating the power plug which saves you time. We cleaned some pretty tough areas and in particular the back shelf on a garage's wash tub that was dirtier that I remembered. The steam cleaned and sanitized the area in just a few minutes. It even cleaned off some old splattered paint from the faucet nozzles on the sink. We cleaned around the cook top stove and removed the tough to get at grease and we steam cleaned the grease screen in the cook top exhaust. Other possible uses are: * Cleaning your stove and oven * Cleaning your old pots and pans * Cleaning the shower doors and glass and removing soap scum and stains * Cleaning the tile and grout in your shower and tubs * Cleaning and sanitizing your countertops * Cleaning and sanitizing your cutting boards * Clean up hardened spills on the stove top * Sterilizing our grandchildren's toys in the toy box. * Clean your refrigerator from those spills that you suddenly find when you give it a good cleaning! * Removing old wall paper from the wall and minimize the damage to the drywall or plaster underneath. Items in the box: * The steam cleaner itself * The instruction manual * The short spray nozzle that is built into the steam cleaner * A funnel for pouring water into the steam cleaner * A pre-marked measuring cup * A long spray nozzle * A flexible spray hose * A short spray nozzle with a brush head * A flat multi-port nozzle for cleaning windows, doors, flat surfaces and steaming clothes * A pop on squeegee attachment for windows * A terry cloth cover for the multi-port nozzle to help scrub and wipe up the area you are cleaning * A bent spray nozzle Cons: * Make sure that you read the safety instructions carefully as there are some items that you must take care of when cleaning with steam. * You get a big blast of steam for about 20 to 30 seconds and then you have to pause for about the same length of time for the unit to build up steam and pressure again. * The water in the tank doesn't last long and you will have to refill repeatedly on bigger projects. I rate this product as a 5 star item for small projects and sanitizing tasks. For big projects you will have to be patient and it will take longer and you will have to refill the water reservoir as you work. I was supplied with a sample product for test and evaluation and I only promised to provide a fair and honest review.", "id": "510240"}

{"review": "Length:: 6:36 Mins The DB-Tech Electric Steamer is an easy and economical way to clean and sanitize your home. I have used other steamers, that are just effective, but they cost 2x more expensive than the DB-Tech unit. Using a steamer is an effective way to clean and sanitize a variety of surfaces. We use ours for the kitchen, bathroom, car, and our porch. It is amazing how much easier clean can become if you direct a jet of steam to the surface before wiping. Notes- - Rather small, once all of the attachments are removed the entire steamer is smaller than a one-gallon pitcher of water. - Heats up to 210F (100C) in just a few minutes - You get about a 20 second burst of steam before it begins to fade. It takes about 15-20 seconds to build up additional steam for the next blast. - A variety of attachments - a grout brush, a standard nozzle, a squeegee scrubber, and an elbow attachment. - The power cord is about 6 feet in length. - The squeegee attachment is effective for cleaning shower doors and glass surfaces. We don't necessarily use it as the final step of cleaning but it is effective to use it and then follow-up with a dry towel in order to remove any streaks. - Holds 175Ml of water, which is more than it seems when you are filling up the steamer. One thing I do is that I always empty all of the water out of the unit prior to storing the steamer. This is to help keep the internals clean, but it also helps prevent me from over-filling the steamer upon my next use. Final Verdict - A nice electric steam cleaner - it offers a variety of attachments at a relative bargain. 41/2 Stars Please Note- I received this product for reviewing purposes", "id": "510240"}

I live on the Florida coast, where the humidity is very high, and we have a big problem with black mold growing on the shower walls and floor. Scrubbing and cleaners just didn't work well. This little steamer does. It was a big job for the little unit and I had to refill the water (6oz) about 8 times, but it destroyed the mold and took the stains with it. I'm very pleased with the results and think this is a great little tool that's kind of fun to use. The steam is consistently hot and the attachments were very well thought out.

But when you want to continue to clean for more than 5 seconds at a time, the machine seems to run out of steam and you have to wait a few seconds before getting the powerful steam again. Maybe the product I got was defective but I could not get the same results as the other posters. I returned the product and received an email saying I will get my refund...oh well, I did try.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "This is an absolute gift from the cleaning gods. Its not expensive and comes with all those attachments that you need to get into the small areas that you keep looking at and saying i should really get a toothbrush and clean. I did under cupboards along the floor... spotless now! I have a ton of hair and use a massive amount of hair products in a weeks time. Just couldn't find the right chemical to clean it off the floor or whatever it stuck to without making a slimy glue that i would end up cussing at... this steamer took every little spot of it off. Steamer in one hand and old towel in the other... spray, wipe, spray, wipe... no chemical to make me gag and choke and it cleaned better than anything i had ever used before. Windows.. a dream. Window screens... blows everything off and cleans off that gunk that blows on them and gets wedged in the holes. Stainless steel appliances... takes a little (wo)man power with a clean dry rag but takes every little fingerprint off that you can't get with a regular rag or with that stainless cleaner that i can't get to work. I read bad and good reviews on this before i decided which machines to go with and most of the bad reviews sound like people that expect this to do the work for you. Very well worth the money. When you refill the machine you will need a little patience cuz it takes a few minutes to produce steam again but its a good time to give your hand a break cuz it will get sore holding it in the same position and pushing the button.

{"review": "My old Rowenta got heavy duty usage and lasted just over 10 years. The only problem it had was with the cord and that is being repaired.

Not distilled, not and super duper brand, just plain old bottled drinking water. Next, make sure the heat setting and steam setting match. Don't select a low heat and high steam or it will spit. Other than that, this is by far, the best and most effective iron on the market.", "id": "510240"}

Either way, I had a coupon for Bed Bath & Beyond and had to iron my clothes, so off I went... - They have a few choices there, and what I wanted was something decent that had a retractable cord. My old one didn't have the retractable cord, and storing it was a pain. This model was the only one in the store with a retractable cord, so I got it. It's a powerful iron. Works very well. Two things I don't like: 1) It's top heavy. Or something. Maybe the base is too small. TWICE right after I bought it, it fell off my ironing board while resting there. That was really annoying. The slightest bump to my board will send this thing to it's doom. I'm glad it still works after that. Annoyed me. 2) The water compartment is a dark blue, and so it's really difficult to see through and see the water level. 3) Because of the big back end, you can't quite get a feel for how small the actual ironing surface is, so as you iron you really need to pay attention to what you're doing. - OK that was 3 things. Nobody reads this anyway! I DID like that it filled up with water OK. My old one would gurgle and spill a lot. The opening is still painfully small (WHEN will someone create an iron with an opening for the water that's bigger than my pinky nail!!?) It doesn't come with a water pitcher thing, but I still have my old one from several irons ago and use that just fine. The buttons for spray and steam and nice and big and I have no problem with them. - Overall I'm happy with it. We'll see if it stands the test of time. I iron a lot.

Well not with this iron, I have never spent this much money on an iron, but couldn't resist because of all of the great reviews. What's great is it doesn't take a long time to iron at all, even the toughest denim will be wrinkle free in less than a minute. I'm so happy I made this purchase. This iron takes out wrinkles like nothing. I like the sprayer because it sprays out so much water evenly rather than the little bit a of water that most irons spray. I have never seen so many steam holes on an iron but I now understand the importance and see a huge difference. Definitely worth buying and I plan to buy one for my friends and family as gifts.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Am a bachelor from the 'old achool' who is not allergic to ironing often. Absolutely dislike a leaky iron. Had that in mind as I shopped around for one. Plus, was looking for a product which was sturdy/durable,offered good steam action and was priced right. Even checked Consumers but didn't like their picks. Then I visited Amazon (which I should've done in the first place) and came across the Rowenta DW 2070 and my search ended. Read most of the reviews. I said to myself, \"thank you Jesus.\" After a couple of weeks' daily use, I'm very pleased with its performance. Strong steam action, no leaks, shirts look nice and I'm a happy camper. P.S. I always use distilled water which helps to prevent calcium buildup in the vents. This product review comes from yours truly with the \"Highly Recommended\" tag affixed.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Coming from sub $20 irons in the past, I decided to invest a little more money this time around with hopes that it lasts longer that a couple of years. I've heard about Rowenta and liked how this model has the retractable cord as well as the 300 steam holes and stainless steel plate. What a huge difference this iron makes compared to my old cheap \"disposable\" irons! This iron gets out creases that my old iron was never able to do. I'm no expert at ironing and perhaps the $100+ models might be even better, but for my purposes of ironing my work shirts this iron is perfect; I just hope it lasts.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Purchasing a Rowenta iron is no longer a guarantee that you are buying a quality item. This is my second and last Rowenta iron. My first iron lasted 10 years with very low maintenance. This iron, purchased two months ago and made in China (not Germany), developed rust after one use. No one stands behind it. Speaking to customer (dis)service at Amazon and Rowenta was a waste of time. Amazon referred me to Rowenta, who blamed it on the \"hard water\" we have in Manhattan. I was not able to obtain a replacement or a refund from Amazon or Rowenta.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I bought into the whole Rowenta name thing. I got the Rowenta Actipress home, read the directions, re-read the directions (I've never paid so much for an iron in my life, wanted to get it right). Yes, stainless steel soleplates are lovely and glide and hover all over your clothes. But, as I finished the final sleeve of my hubby's XL Linen shirt ...drip, Oh did I hit the mist button, no checked that, drip, drip, leak, drip. Before the ironing was over 2 almost finished linen shirts had to go into the laundry again because of the water marks ugh! I HATE that! So, I returned the Rowenta and got the T-Fal diffusion iron also with 1400 watts, approx. the same weight, and a nice smooth soleplate that emits the same amount of steam for HALF the price and NO DRIPS! By the way, with the Rowenta I tried everything in the directions, turning up the heat, using tap water- then using half and half as the directions advise if you have hard water --nothing helped this thing just drips and leaks.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I purchased this iron to replace my Rowenta Professional (made in Germany) which served me for 7 years. A year later the cord reel function no longer works - big disappointment as this appeared to be the main selling point for the iron. Another quality issue also emerged recently - the power cord seems to be fraying from the inside just at the point where it enters the cord storage chamber. Not much I can do about it - the iron will not reel in the cord to stop it from constantly resting on the edge of the cord storage chamber. This Iron was made in China. Cheap labour. Lower quality. Do better Rowenta.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "You pay top $ for these Rowenta irons. Here's what you get for this: The iron is well-designed mechanically and ergonomically. It feels good in the hand. The plate material is very nice and glides very well. The knobs are of good quality and you get the impression that this machine will last a good long while. In these ways it is a lot better than my previous Black & Decker models and it had me feeling that I have spent my money well. Here's the problem: if you have cotton garments to press, like men's shirts, and want to use steam (as you must) - you are going to have problems. The iron seems to be under-designed in the thermal engineering department. It has propensity to leak water. I have the temperature knob all the way up for cotton, so this cannot be the reason. But the iron leaks without fail each time I'm trying to press with steam. This is very frustrating to say the least; and absolutely unacceptable. The only way I have been able to mitigate the problem is to keep the water reservoir less than half full - which means I have to fill it several times during each ironing job. I miss my old Black & Decker. Seems to be the same old trade off: un-elegant but functionally superior American product versus design superiority at the expense of functionality in a European product. I normally choose the former. In this case I got fooled.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I'm giving this steamer 3 stars but figured out a way to get it to work like a 5 star product. I needed a travel size steamer for our destination wedding. Because I wanted something compact I knew the tank size would be small and that I might need to refill throughout the steaming \"session.\" The product is about the size of a medium hair dryer. I tried it out at home and was initially very disappointed with how much water sprayed out along with the steam, leaving water drips and spots all over my dress. This is ok for some fabrics but ruinous for others. The table where I had the steamer sitting was also covered in water (be sure to use a towel under it). As other reviews have mentioned, there is no on/off switch so once you plug it in, it starts heating up. Similarly there are no controls to turn it off to keep it from running dry. I figured I would be sending it back and started to look for other steamers. I also placed a call to a bridal shop to get recommendations for where to get my dress pressed. The very kind seamstress at the shop suggested I use a piece of cheesecloth over the steamer to stop the spitting water from getting on the dress. I put the cheesecloth (folded over like it comes in the package) over the steamer with a rubber band and this did the trick! The steamer worked like a charm. It was more effective than when I tried it without the cheesecloth and there were no water spots, the cheesecloth caught them all. I changed the cheesecloth a few times to keep it from being too soaked. I hate making adaptations to products to make them work, but for the price and what I need this for, this steamer with some cheesecloth is now a good enough product to keep.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Used this product on chiffon material. It was very easy and convenient to use and smoothed out the wrinkles very easily. It's compact size makes it easy to store. It heats up quickly and makes a lot of steam. I am pleased with my purchase.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Overall, this product is great. It's made my life so much easier in that I never have to worry about wrinkles. I can pack my suitcase and bring it along, confident that even if I cram everything in, I'll be able to steam out the wrinkles quickly and easily. As someone who hates ironing (and is terrible at it), this alone makes the steamer worth the money to me. Furthermore, it is much, much easier to use than an iron--no danger of accidentally pressing wrinkles deeper into clothes with this little device! There are a few drawbacks you should be aware of when comparing this product to others. First, it's very small. This is great for travel, but you should be aware that you will probably only be able to steam about three shirts before you have to refill it (you have to wait a few minutes for it to cool down before you can add the water, then a few more for it to heat up again). As long as you aren't looking to steam a pile of clothes quickly, this is not a big problem. Second, even when using filtered water, I've had problems with mineral buildup. Occasionally (like if you accidentally tip the steamer while steaming your clothes), this buildup will boil up and out onto your clothes, leaving white gunk on them. You can wipe it off, but be on the lookout. Third, there is no \"off\" or \"hold\" button on the unit--you pour in the water, plug it in, wait, and had better be ready as soon as it boils to start steaming or else you risk losing half the water as you shuffle around getting your clothes ready. Finally, even when you don't fill the water up to the \"max\" line, the steamer will occasionally spray out little drops of boiling water. Be careful to hold it away from your skin. All in all a good product that would get five stars from me if it didn't have these few little quirks.", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "I originally purchased the Steamfast SF-435W travel steamer and found it very powerful, easy to use, and handy for straightening clothes and enhancing the curls in my hair. (This was discovered by accident as ringlets formed while I steamed my clothes. You have to be careful around the skin and eyes, but I highly recommend this steamer for curls as well as clothes.) The Steamfast is a terrific steamer and I now keep it in my bathroom for daily use. Since we are traveling to Europe soon and the Steamfast does not support 220V, I purchased the Conair GS-1 travel steamer (the green and white one) as a substitute. The Conair heats up nearly as quickly as the Steamfast but does not have the directed force of steam that the Streamfast has. Steam just sort of comes out of the Conair. This is likely due to the 800W vs 400W advantage that the Steamfast has over the Conair. Also, the Conair seems flimsy in comparison. For example, the water access on the Conair involves twisting the entire top half off of the unit. If it ever breaks, you can throw the Conair away. The Steamfast has a black cap to the water area and you simply remove the cap (which I imagine could be replaced if needed, though not likely.) It also seems that hot water could spill out of the Conair, whereas the Steamfast has the upwardly angled steam spout, making accidental spillage less likely. If you are comparing the Steamfast to the Conair, I would definitely recommend the Steamfast as superior.", "id": "510240"}

{"review": "I own a jiffy professional steamer, so I'm pretty familiar with steaming things and how they should work. I have purchased portable steamers before and they always fall short of doing the job correctly and quickly.. They end up wetting your clothes more than anything. I read the reviews on this and decided to take a chance because it wasn't too expensive. I needed it because I travel and my suits always look like they came out of a paper bag. I filled up the reservoir to just below max and plugged it in. Within minutes the water was boiling and heavy steam was coming out. I put on the brush attachment and started steaming, expecting it to take a while to get the wrinkles out. I used it on a wool suit. I did the whole suit in about 5 minutes. I highly recommend it!", "id": "510240"}
{"review": "Hello - I am in no way related to the SteamFast company. I have owned two other travel/compact steamers: Jiffy, makes a very good steamer as well, however, it is more than twice the money and, although I had their compact steamer for at least six years, I didn't use it that much (as I had their industrial steamer) and recently the heater unit on it broke. So I'm not sure that their quality is so good unless I got a lemon. Additionally, the Jiffy model is slightly larger than the SteamFast model. (Note: This SteamFast is not dual voltage, just 120v only. Jiffy has a dual voltage steamer that works well too.) The other model I used was a Franzus and the only thing better about this one was it's size. As a steamer it doesn't perform well at all. The SteamFast Compact Fabric Steamer SF-435 does a very good job (just as good as Jiffy) at steaming out wrinkles - it has more steaming holes than Jiffy - (though if you want a super crisp look nothing replaces an iron), it's price is great for the quality, and it's a bit smaller than the Jiffy though it is larger that it 'feels' in the photo. I'd like to see them make this unit at least a couple of inches smaller but it's still a great unit. In my opinion, this unit can be used at home (especially since home units are much more expensive and take up a lot of room) or for traveling. A very good product. I highly recommend it. (I also recommend using distilled or purified water in clothes steamers whenever possible as it will extend the life of the unit.) Tip: Use an oven mitt when steaming garments - this allows one to put a hand under the garment while steaming for a better result. Other tip: Stretch fabric tightly while steaming for the best results. You can also steam things like hats and purses that have gotten bent (may help further to give straw hats a light water spray beforehand) or suede and leather that has creased though take special care to use the steamer only in short bursts or you may damage the leather/suede. Don't overfill as the unit (like all steamers) will spit water drops. I'm giving this steamer 4 stars instead of 5 only because I've yet to find a better travel steamer, however, there is some room for improvement on performance though it works quite well for traveling and saves on pressing bills at hotels, and, of course, the convenience.", "id": "510240"}

It's the right price, and it's exactly what you probably want from this. It heats up in under a minute, it doesn't spurt water and it perfectly steams. This thing has saved me a ridiculous amount of money on dry cleaning and I would highly, HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who steams on a regular daily basis and for those who need something portable just for special events. I have owned a big, long, tall steamer, and I can tell you that this little guy is perfect for my small city apartment (probably for dorms, too). It works just as well, if not better.

{"review": "Over 30 years ago, my mother, who prided herself on her immaculate laundry and ironing skills, introduced me to the benefit of buying a Teflon coated ironing board cover. It had a metal-like woven surface that was coated with a somewhat tacky surface, which held the garment in place and reflected the heat from the iron and heated both sides of the item at the same time. This speeded up the ironing process and resulted in a much nicer finished product. I loved how much better it performed over a regular cloth cover. I bought one for myself back then and have used nothing else, since. As my old covers would wear out, I would go in search of another, identical cover as a replacement. Along the way, I learned that having thick padding underneath the cover enhanced the result and eliminated any marks from the metal board underneath. As one cover would wear out, I would simply layer the next cover atop the old to increase the padding. For some reason, it has been difficult to find replacement covers like this in recent years. The local stores seem to only carry the cheap, cloth ones. Recently I found myself in need of a new cover, as my old one had developed a tear. I searched high and low and decided on the Kennedy Home Collection 2452 Scorch Resistant Silicone Coated Ironing Board Pad and Cover. HURRAH! It is perfection! It has everything I was looking for: the \"Teflon\" coating, a super thick attached pad (cannot bunch or move independently underneath), elastic around the entire bottom for a secure attachment to your board, AND two velcro straps in the middle underneath to further secure the cover to the board. It has the \"tacky\" surface which holds garments where you want them and heats evenly on both sides.I HIGHLY recommend this pad and cannot imagine that you could want anything more in an ironing board cover. The price is excellent and I may order a second one just to be sure I don't have trouble getting one in the future!", "id": "510240"}

In addition, since it is scorch-resistant, there are no unsightly steam stains that are left behind. I would order this product again and recommend it to anyone who irons frequently.", "id": "510240"}

But a scorch mark appeared recently, and was leaching onto my fabrics when I attempted to iron them. I am not hard on my irons, nor careless with ironing or the care of my fabrics. I was careful with my use, stick to the appropriate temperatures recommended and I used distilled water in my iron. I do not understand why my cover broke down so quickly. I washed it today (following the tag instructions) to try to remove the brown scorch mark and the fabric of the cover disintegrated around the scorch mark. Apparently to return the cover I'd have to pay return shipping. I'd only get a partial refund as well.

There's no difference in this silicone coated cover and the cotton cover I've purchased in the past for the same price. I thought the silicone would save a bit of time, but it doesn't at all.

{"review": "I bought this microwave to replace our (perfectly good) huge 1200W Panasonic microwave. We simply wanted more counterspace and didn't need one so big anymore. We pretty much only use it for reheating and for popcorn - it does the job, and I'm somewhat surprised that it doesn't take that much longer than our previous microwave, even though this one has roughly 2/3 the wattage. It is taking some time to get used to the button layout, but that's not the fault of the microwave. It holds our dinner plates (10.5\") perfectly, should hold 11\" plates just fine. Also holds insulated travel mugs fine. The carousel seems to move fairly fast, so you have to be sure the travel mug is put right in the center of the carousel. I do have three minor \"complaints\": 1) the \"Reset\" button is awkward to me. It's nowhere near the \"Start/Stop\" button, and it seems like it should say \"Clear\" instead of \"Reset\", but maybe that's just me. 2) the microwave slides on the counter. Seriously. When you open the door, you have to put your thumb on the display panel or the microwave will simply slide forward. I solved this by putting little rubber self-stick pads on each leg. No more sliding. 3) I wish microwave manufacturers would use the \"flat\" type plugs, like the kinds used on refrigerators so you can push them closer to the wall (we have ours on a counter that's 13\" deep so we need every possible inch). The type of plug they use makes the microwave stick out from the wall several inches. I understand they need ventilation, but 1\" should suffice. Also, if you don't put the rubber pads on the legs to keep it from sliding, it will cause the microwave to keep pushing against the plug, putting pressure on the cord at the plug, eventually possibly bending it to the point of breaking, causing a potential fire hazard - I know this from experience :( My other concern is brand reliability. We had our Panasonic for 8 years and it still ran like a top. Prior to that we had a Sanyo purchased in 1991 that is still working today. I hope this brand proves just as reliable. UPDATE 6/7/14: I have changed my rating from 3-stars to 1-star. Clearly I should have used the microwave longer before writing my review. A huge complaint: the glass plate that goes on the carousel shifts VERY easily. Every time I put something in the microwave, I have to re-center it on the carousel. If you're not very careful when removing your item from the microwave, the glass plate will slide out as well. This is what happened yesterday - I ended up with 1000 tiny shards of glass on the floor because it slid right out. I'm very disappointed, and cannot recommend this microwave to anyone. While I realize this was user error, I should not have to re-set the glass plate during/after each use, and I certainly shouldn't have to worry about it shifting so easily. In the 10 years that I owned my last microwave, I never once had to re-center the glass plate.", "id": "289935"}

{"review": "This is our first inverter microwave oven. We had to replace a small cheapo disposable microwave we got at a big discount retail chain. This is a nice midsized oven. It does not dominate your counter space like the larger counter top ovens, and it also large enough to do more than pop popcorn. We eat alot of the low calorie diet tv dinners.. this oven heats them evenly and to perfection. The microwave panini meals even end up with toasted crisp bread. In 30 years this is probably the best microwave oven we have owned, and you cannot beat the price.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "I ordered this to supply a microwave for the new house. It is easy to use, works well, and looks good. It was also well packaged and arrived pretty quickly. All in all, I am satisfied with its performance. Also, It doesnt feel cheap and the button to open it doesn't stick. I also like that you can just press the buttons for the time that you want instead of having to hit a specific input time button or turn a dial or do some other form of annoying time wasting step. You just press 1-3-0 start for a minute 30. Exactly how it should be. I have been using it more and more, and it heats food quickly and evenly. I have had to adjust my microwave intuition (setting it for how much your food really needs) because it gets hot pretty quickly. Again, satisfied and would recommend! As always, please indicate if this was helpful. Cheers", "id": "289935"}

{"review": "I generally like Panasonic products, which is why when my GE microwave gave up the ghost I decided to buy the NN-SN651W as a replacement. This product has several pros and cons, but on balance I would purchase another model if I had to do it over again. One thing that is excellent is the instruction manual: it is quite thorough, and if you happen to have issues with yours, it's a great place to start and is well ahead of competitors. The oven itself is quite powerful and cooks food very quickly. Having said that, despite the turntable feature my experience is that the food cooks somewhat unevenly (especially true for defrosting or reheating products with meat in them.) I find it to be on par with the Amana and GE products I have owned in this area, maybe a tad more uneven. I do think on balance that it's an effective microwave. My biggest objection by far is the noise it makes when operating. It is very loud, and is far louder than any other microwave I have ever owned including a first-generation Amana. The noise is the primary reason that I gave the oven three stars, and also the primary reason I say I would not buy this oven again. Despite Panasonic's reputation for quality, I think the NN-SN651W is a mediocre microwave at best. It cooks food mostly adequately, but has some annoying ergonomics and is much louder than expected. Unless you are dead set on a midrange Panasonic microwave, I think you are better off looking elsewhere.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "This microwave has a lot to boast about: innovative technology, easy to keep clean, and modern appearance. Unfortunately we were only able to enjoy ours for just over a year. Three weeks after the anniversary of its purchase, it died. We tried every cooking mode, but it shuts itself off after about 2 seconds. Very disappointing for what I thought was a great brand. Our previous Panasonic microwave lasted about 20 years. I know they don't design them to last that long anymore, but I think it should at least survive for 5 years. I read some other reviews from folks who have had similar experiences.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "This unit was my first experience with the \"inverter heating technology\". I like it so much better than my older units that when on reduced power cooking, it just gave you shorter durations of full power heating. This unit actually reduces the cooking power over the total cooking time. I no longer experience overheated spots on my defrosted meats. I seldom actually cook anything in it, other than fresh vegetables. I mostly re-heat left-overs, de-frost meats, heat frozen dishes, and quickly boil water when needed. However, the \"inverter\" funtion is about all that I really like about this model. The things that I was dissatisfied with are: The interior light does not come on when the door is open; it is not a quiet operating unit, if fact, I would describe it as quite noisey; there is a 5 beep alarm that sounds upon the completion of the heating cycle, but no further notice alerting you that food is still in the microwave awaiting to be removed; you cannot use the timer function if your heating something in the microwave; and finally the opening and closing of the oven door is very hard to do. The force required to push the \"door open button\" is quite excessive. I doubt children under the age of 15 would be able to open it, and you cannot just push the door closed, you nearly have to slam it closed. So, in short I have very mixed feelings about recommending this unit to anyone. (An update after two years of use) The microwave still operates, although, lately I'm starting to notice the machine stopping during the heating cycle and clearing the control panel settings. So if I'm there at the time this happens, I have to guesstimate the remaining time needed and re-set the control panel accordingly. I suspect that with all of the door slamming's I've had to apply to close the door, it has had an effect to the door safety switch contacts. I have doubts that it will last out the rest of the year.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "The product works well, but the interior light only goes on when the oven is working, and it goes off when the timer goes off. It is dark inside when I open the door.

The oven slides back every time I close the door and I have to move it forward again.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "There are only two things wrong with this microwave. 1. the interior light only goes on when the microwave is running.

{"review": "This model is the OGB8902-B. There is the same one without the B. I couldn't find any difference between the two models. Same picture, but the B was lower priced, so I ordered it. Mine arrived DOA, so I had to return it. It was set up and ready to go, so I thoroughly checked it out before boxing it back up. I'm not going to trash this microwave for arriving DOA. If it fits your needs, you will love it. Plenty of good features. *The price is right. *900W will reheat (and cook) just fine. (For this wattage and size, one of the best values I found.) *It's nicely compact, but big enough to fit plates and various larger containers/bowls. *Very sleek looking, it will look good on your counter. *Plenty of presets. But look at the picture as the description is incorrect: There is no 30-sec or minute plus button. I really don't cook in the microwave or use the presets, but I do use the minute plus feature several times a day for quick bursts of heat. Had I paid closer attention to the picture, I would not have selected this one. So having to return and lacking a needed feature, I selected another microwave. I read thru many reviews before selecting a microwave. In all price points there seem to be many complaints along the lines of \"this microwave broke in 2 months / I had my previous one for 10 years\". Don't think higher price tags mean higher quality, as it seems quality control is lacking in many places. With my limited microwave use and after having problems myself with a far more expensive one--repaired free under warranty / same problem a year later / GE wanted $85 for the service call--my new approach is to buy a decent cheap one, forgo repairs/service, and just get a new one every couple of years when/if it breaks.", "id": "289935"}

{"review": "Fabulous little microwave! I stumbled onto an Amazon price of $64 with Prime free shipping. Wow! The micro, while rather small, can still fit my largest (11\") dinner plate, with a cook cover, STACKED with a second plate and cover. Quieter than a full sized micro. 700 watts is a bit slower, however fine for reheating, and often you don't want full power anyway. I feel bad for those purchasers who must have received a lemon. That happens. I decided to purchase from Amazon because 1) by and large, microwaves are reliable, 2) $20 less than on sale locally, 3) saves the bother of going to the store and standing in lines, 4) if I did have to return to the store, more standing in line, 5) returns via UPS are easier, 6) Amazon is easier to deal with returns than most stores, 7) even if I didn't get free shipping return for a defective unit, cost would be less than the $20 above. To operate: Press the large knob; 1 minute begins. Then turn the dial up/down to add/subtract seconds. Quick and simple! This is a better system than my full sized micro. Pros: Easy to use dial. 3 beeps at the end, and then the machine is silent. Candy apple metallic red is well done. Far fewer beeps to have to endure as you set the timer. Best of all, you can add/subtract time with the dial as food is cooking, in 10 second increments. A smart design! Neutral: 12 preset modes, with +/- adjust-ability for weight of the food.

Lower power? big deal. It is a compact microwave for reheating.

{"review": "This microwave gets 5 stars in aesthetics it looks much better in front of you than in the pictures. I have this in my man cave and I have gotten so many compliments. This fact and the reasonable price (I got the black model for $59 the red was at $99) lead me to choose this gadget also I had some space limitations so this little good looking guy was exactly what I needed. with that been said the problems starts when you try to set up the clock for example. The instructions are not as clear as you wish I spent more than a couple of minutes just trying just to set the clock right which I finally managed to do something like in the 5th or 6th try.....this should not be that hard. The buttons while cool and retro are not as intuitive as you expect and the images are a so tiny and difficult to see that almost all of them look the same to the naked eye. (at least mine but I am old...) You do have a little image of a popcorn bag in the dial position 1 that looks almost exactly than the vegetables, the soup bowl, etc. Some people here had complained that the microwave is not powerful enough. Because this thing is rather small I bought those smaller popcorn bags that fit in there pretty well. The first time I tried to make some popcorn setting the dial button to position 1 (popcorn in the dial) the thing burned some. So I need to use less time/power for the smaller bags with that said it seems to me that power is not an issue. It is my understanding that if you have space problems, a small kitchen or small counter top space this thing will fit well. It has a carousel that spins like the bigger Microwaves and again it is a VERY good looking microwave, way too cool. If you needs are heating some food (soup, coffee or make some microwave food, popcorn, etc) and have some space limitations this would be perfect for you..If your needs are more complicated, exotic or demanding when talking about cooking or you need to heat bigger bowls for a big family for instance then I think your could be better off looking somewhere else .

{"review": "While I liked the idea of the \"Inverter Technology\" that lets you easily cook at lower power without duty cycling the microwave, that feature doesn't outweigh Panasonic's poor warranty policies. My microwave died after two months of use - everything was working fine one moment and then the lights went out, dead as a doorstop. (Being an electrical engineer, I think it's a safe assumption that the power supply is what died but that's only an assumption) Had this died within the 30 day period, Amazon would have printed out a shipping label, had UPS show up at my front door to pick up the defective unit and most likely cross-shipped a new microwave out to me so I could have a replacement in just a matter of days. Instead, since it was outside the 30 day period, I had to go through Panasonic's warranty service. Their only option is to have me hand-deliver the defective product to an authorized Service Center; the nearest one is a 90 minute drive from here. That would be understandable if I lived in rural Nebraska but I live in a heavily populated area and would probably pass thirty or forty Starbucks and at least three Best Buys that I can think of on the way to the Service Center. There's no option to ship the product by UPS; I have to drive it to the repair center. Of course they're unlikely to repair or replace the microwave on the spot so that'll be another three hour round trip to get the repaired microwave. This is a somewhat pricey microwave but to have to take six hours out of what little free time I have on the weekends just isn't worth the trouble. I'll just chalk this up as an expensive lesson in how not all manufactures are customer-centric and go look for another (non-Panasonic) microwave. I can't comment on the overall reliability of Panasonic microwaves - I only have my own experience to go on. Perhaps out of a thousand appliances only one dies in under three months and I'm just lucky this time around. As far as the design goes, some things I liked, some things take some getting used to. The spin knob instead of numeric keypad is \"cute\" and does the job but it does take some getting used to. It's pretty easy to overshoot the time you want and have to backtrack to get to your goal. The \"always-on\" variable power setting is pretty nice - I'd much rather use continuous power than have it cycle on and off to approximate partial power. I don't think it's quite linear, though - cooking at half power seems to deliver closer to two thirds power - two minutes at half power is much hotter than one minute at full power. Again, you can get used to it and make adjustments based on experience. The \"auto cook\" feature was a bust. I eat plenty of frozen dinners and the cooking time was a) never right (food came out much hotter than if I'd just followed the directions on the box) and b) took significantly longer (I think it cooks at low power until it detect steam, then a quick blast and you're done) If the frozen box said cook for six minutes, then \"auto-cook, frozen dinner\" would take eight to ten minutes. That feature was quickly ignored, sadly. Also, there are plenty of gripes here about the light not coming on when you open the door and let me add to that long list. While you don't -need- the light to put a plate into the microwave, it's a nice thing to be able to see what's going on. It's really a matter of \"what were they thinking?\" when the designers opted to have a dark, unlit box rather than the (very standard) lit interior. There's no getting used to that one, it just seems wrong. Not that it's horribly inconvenient but why did they feel the need to make it even a little bit more inconvenient than necessary? Would I buy this unit again (if I hadn't had reliability issues?) Maybe, maybe not. I can't say that the features that make this microwave more compelling (variable power, large turntable) outweigh the disadvantages (useless auto-cook programming, no interior light, odd dial interface). There are other microwaves out there that are competitive with this one and there's no distinct advantage with going with this particular product line... -------------------- Quick update, 24 hours after posting this review. On contacting the Panasonic \"Customer Service Center\" I discover that it's a guy fixing appliances out of his home in a residential area! He actually asked me to call ahead before coming down so that he could make sure he's home - and mentioned that between 8 AM and 9 AM was most convenient for him. I was expecting at least a commercial storefront but this seems awfully small time to be the best that Panasonic could offer! Wanting this issue to be over and done with, I went out and bought a microwave from a different manufacturer - Kenmore Stainless Steel 1.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave 69123 which is OEM'ed from LG and similar in design to a number of other Kenmore and LG microwaves. It's the same size and the same power rating but in so many ways the Kenmore is much, much nicer than this Panasonic. The user interface is significantly more informative - to the point of displaying whole phrases (\"reheat: plate\") so you've got feedback on what's happening. The door opens much more smoothly on the Kenmore (I hadn't realized how much that mattered until I got one that worked smoothly) and low and behold, a light comes on when you open the door! There's even a nice feature that reminds you every few minutes that the heating is finished but you forgot to take out your cup of tea. In retrospect I guess I'm glad I got the Panasonic first because it really makes me appreciate how much more I enjoy the Kenmore's design features! (And, if there ever happens to be any problems, I can just drive it to the nearby Sears and drop it off to be fixed!)", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "I've only had this 2 days, but I thought I'd get a quick review up on it. This oven is so new, even Panasonic didn't know about it. I called them up, and their customer service knew nothing. A search on the Panasonic website came back blank. So, what the heck, I bought it. It appeared to be very similar to the SD688 models, with one exception. The digital display got panned on the 688 as being hard to read from a normal standing angle. I guessed that this fancy blue display was their answer to that, and I was right! The bright blue display is very easy to read up close without bending over., and from an angle. I rarely cook in a microwave, so all of the fancy button options are moot. \"Inverter Melt\", \"Popcorn\" \"Inverter Turbo Defrost\". If I have to keep the manual handy to use my microwave, I'm not likely to use that feature. I did try the \"Sensor Reheat\" feature on some boneless chicken. It stopped it at the right time. I like the dial feature, it's very intuitive. The one minute button is nice. One thing a Microwave does, is it sits there on the counter most of the time doing nothing. This does that very well. The SS finish and the square lines look really good. At 20\" wide, it just right for my counter. It's taller than my old oven, so I can fit my salad dressing cruet in there. Another thing a microwave should do is last for years. We'll have to see on that one. I will update as more details become apparent. More observations 10/12/11: I tried the Sensor Reheat a few more times. It seems to work pretty well. It's weird though if your timing your food prep, setting the table, or whatever, because there's no preset time. The 'Inverter Melt' function works quite well. Here is where the inverter technology makes a difference - it actually heats at low power. Conventional microwaves just cycle full power off and on to achieve 'low' power. I tried 'Sensor Cook' with some potatoes. I set it on 3. Silly me - 3 is for omelets. For potatoes, use 7. Fresh vegetables - 8. There's no explanation what the different settings actually mean. Forget it. So with all this fancy technology, Panasonic could have added one basic non-technological feature: The light. It only comes on while cooking. But not when you open the door. Really? That's enough to almost give me buyers remorse. It never occurred to me that this feature, that's been around for 30 years, would be missing. Edit 2/18/12: After 4 months and prompting by a fellow reviewer, I'm bumping this to 4 stars. Mechanically, the engineering is excellent. The inverter technology is extremely useful, making it a more versatile and valuable tool in the cooking process. Still, the software side is gimmicky and borderline absurd . Take the Melt & Soften button, for 1 example. I can melt butter by setting the power to 1 or 2 and 30 seconds. Or I can use the Melt & soften button, saving me several whole button pushes! I have a choice of 15,16,17,and 18. But,it would be nice to know which power setting that button selects, instead of \"Butter, Cream Cheese\", etc. Imagine if your conventional oven had settings for Ham, Chicken, and Turkey, but didn't tell you the temperature if you use them. I just don't get it. Panasonic, please just tell us what these programs really mean.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "Another reviewer gave a lot more details, and that was helpful. I'll keep it short and stick to the things I noticed: 1) No light when you open the door, which is odd, but doesn't really bother me. 2) You set the cooking time with a dial, rather than typing it in on a keypad. The dial to set the cooking time is good, I guess. Not much easier or more difficult than a keypad, so I don't have a strong opinion about it. 3) Prior models (according to reviews) had problems with the door lock and the display. Both are great on this model. Door locks solidly and the display is very easy to read. 4) The Sensor Reheat button worked very well the few times I've used it to reheat leftovers. They came out nice and hot, but not overdone. That's the only feature I've used, other than just setting a time and pushing \"start\". Overall, we are happy with this product, after about a month of daily use. It's a good compromise between power and size. I wanted a more powerful microwave than our prior, very compact, one. I also wanted to have it be a reasonably small size, so I checked dimensions carefully. This one had the best size/power combination for us.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "We're a family of 4 with two little ones. We don't actually \"cook\" with microwaves too often, but primarily use our microwaves to heat veggies, reheat left-overs, etc... With regards to our needs, the Panasonic NN-SD681S has met and exceeded our expectations. Coming from a 900 Watt microwave I think our favorite feature is just how much more quickly this 1200 Watt microwave accomplishes its tasks. Steaming vegetables takes about 1 minute less than with our previous microwave. Heating a beverage takes less than a minute now. I will say though that steaming can really kick up alot of moisture inside the microwave. It gets moist to the point of being fairly wet, needing a towel dry. I've not used the sensor reheat feature on any microwave before this one. Frankly I expected the sensor reheat to be something of a gimmick. However it does an outstanding job of reheating food thoroughly. As a test I reheated a plate of chicken, potatoes, and veggies together and was surprised how each item was more or less 'appropriately' reheated. Only a couple of instances over the past few months when something was a little cooler on the inside than outside after a reheat. As a parent of young children I appreciate the child lock feature. Which is a code that when entered sets the microwave into an unresponsive, stasis mode. Enter the unlock \"code\" to reactivate. The child lock is easy to use, and as long as your kids don't learn the \"code\", it should keep the occasional, or habitual button masher from accidentally turning the microwave on when you're not looking. This unit is loaded with a variety of features and settings. Some of which may not be familiar to all users. Fortunately Panasonic provides a pretty straightforward users guide that does a good job explaining the various features and their functions. Wireless users be aware, this microwave, located in about the center of our 600 sq ft first floor, decimates the wi-fi signal for the entire floor when running. Music, movies, downloads, anything that requires a wireless signal stops shortly after we begin using the microwave. Changing router locations (located on the 2nd floor) did not help whatsoever. Not a deal breaker, but those whose smoke/CO2 detectors are interconnected via wi-fi should probably make note of this. I'd guess this is a potential problem for most microwaves, so I won't knock Panasonic for this. Unfortunately this microwave does not have the best alert/reminder system. It beeps 5 times after finishing its cycle. That's it. I haven't noticed it providing any follow up warning of completion beyond that. Our previous unit had a steady, 4 second beep and would beep every couple of minutes thereafter until it was opened. A much better system in my opinion. Other thoughts. It turns out that no light when opening the door isn't such a big deal for me. The blue LED screen is easy to read. Stainless steel is a very sleek and modern look, and it does pick up prints easily. This unit is a space saver compared to similar units. Coming from an all push-button microwave, I appreciate the retractable knob control more than I thought I would. Looking at the whole picture in terms of price, features, and performance, and I feel the NN-SD681S is a solid value and would recommend it to anyone currently in the market for a microwave. Update (April 2013): The microwave continues to perform well after more than a year of moderate use. We barely notice it's there, which is a testimony to its effectiveness. Two things I have noticed: 1. It's loud. Forget having a conversation with someone across the room when this thing is on. Though given that we don't run it for more than a few minutes at at time (boiling veggies for example), it's not a big hindrance to us. 2. The door release button does require some effort/force to open. As a parent of younger children that's actually a plus for us. However I can see where some users might be turned off by that. Update (March 2014) Just a quick update to verify that the microwave is still going strong after more than 2 years of service. A reliable microwave with no problems so far.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "In most ways, this microwave oven is similar to the earlier Panasonic Prestige NN-SD688S model. Both are virtually identical in size, and most functions overlap. The functional changes, though minor, are not insignificant. The NN-SD688S model improved upon its predecessor by replacing its cluttered interface with a more simple and usable one. This model retains that look and feel. It uses a dial for setting time, weight, cook settings, or other parameters that formerly used a keypad. On this model, the dial can be retracted when not in use. A big improvement over the previous model is the display. It now uses brighter blue numbers that can be seen from a bigger range of angles and heights, and should satisfy the objections people had to the earlier model. The new display also shows the cook level throughout the cook cycle, rather than only when setting it. In addition to standard features such as timed cooking, a sensor reheat function, defrosting, popcorn and keep warm buttons, there are fourteen sensor cook settings for specific foods. The NN-SD688S had nine. When the door is open, a label lists the number to use for each food item, so fourteen settings are not overwhelming as they were on the earlier touch pad models. The beverage button disappeared when the previous model was released, and is still lacking. I found that feature useful on other microwaves. By dialing a number for the cook setting, it has the appearance of setting a cook level. Since the items for each number seem unrelated, it's not possible to decide that something might be between eggs and soup and choose a level in between. However, many microwave ovens have specific buttons for certain foods, just as this has a popcorn button. I wouldn't question what else I could cook with a frozen pizza button, but consumers might question what level six (really setting six) can cook besides pizza. If you think of it as a replacement for fourteen preprogrammed buttons, you can appreciate its added simplicity for the listed foods. Another addition is the Melt and Soften button. It can be used for melting chocolate, softening butter or cream cheese, and there's even a setting for softening ice cream. I haven't tried those settings yet, but they include ones I'd actually use. There is a \"recipe store\" button that can store only a single recipe at a time, so if popcorn is not your thing and you want a custom button for something else specific, you can use it. The inverter function raises or lowers the power level generatated by the oven, rather than controlling power by cycling on and off. The power was reduced to 1200 watts from the previous model's 1300 watts. I'm not sure how much difference it will make with the inverter settings, but could potentially affect anything heated at full power. Many recipes assume that you have 1000 watts, so cook time may be closer to that in a recipe. But I'd rather set less time and figure that out myself. The previous model's stylistic flair was replaced with a more spartan but high end appearance. That model's four small feet provided little traction, causing the oven to move for some users when the door button was pressed. This model has pads on the front feet that prevent it from slipping. When I first tried it out, it didn't slip. When I moved it to its final location, it slipped far too much. Strangely enough, the back feet are no longer there, and the microwave sits on bare metal surfaces there. I ended up using an adhesive non-slip putty to keep the microwave in place. Perhaps the surface wasn't perfectly flat, but the feet don't seem to be adjustable. The new feet may or may not be an improvement. The light does not go on when the door is open, and only lights while cooking. Many users find that very objectionable. I didn't like that omission, probably because I was used to having a light, but in a microwave with a white surface, it's less of a need than in a much larger conventional oven. This model lets you set up to three consecutive cook settings (as opposed to its predecessor's five) so you could set a one hour delay, a cook time at a certain level, and a keep warm stage, for example. Five seemed excessive but I don't see what Panasonic gained by lowering it. In the example they gave in their previous manual, setting a cook time at one level followed by a cook time at a different level (something that instructions on food boxes sometimes suggest) could not be integrated with my example. Once the start button is pressed, all stages will be executed sequentially. The timer stage can be used independently, but not concurrently. With the microwave I'm replacing, I very often used the timer, even while the microwave was cooking. I find that loss a bigger annoyance than the light issue.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "My review here is pretty simple as we've only had our Panasonic NN-SD681S for a few weeks. So far no regrets.. I had not bought a new microwave oven in quite a while, so did a lot of research on brands, their ratings and what to look for and avoid. Panasonic rated very well and I've had good luck with other consumer products from them before so we chose this unit. We got it through Amazon as no local retailer(s) carried or even listed it and most of the other microwaves that I saw were either too small, far too big or looked really cheap.. I felt this was a stylish, yet well-priced choice that was the right size for us and fit our needs. I think it's nice looking and I also like the blue display which is bright and very readable. I've not played around with the functionality much but can say that the sensor reheat function works very well for reheating things. Just put the item in, hit sensor reheat + start and it does the rest. That being said, be careful when reheating certain liquids such as milk or cream. + : Likes - (in no order) A - Size (a good compromise and perfect for our needs - two adults, no kids) B - Functionality C - Looks - : Dislikes - (in no order) A - Interior light works when unit is on but NOT when you open the door!? B - Brushed stainless finish looks nice but shows finger prints and smudges very easily. C - Sometimes when you push the button, the door doesn't always 'pop' open all the way, instead it kinda opens 'halfway' and you have to put your finger underneath to finish the job. Overall, I would definitely recommend this unit to others. As it's been less than a month, I cannot say how reliable it will end up being though but am keeping my fingers crossed. If we have any problems, I'll update this review.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "I have had this for over three months and it has only worked for a couple of weeks. So far it has been into service three times and must of cost Panasonic at least twice its value. My gas bills driving back and forth are greater than the value of the microwave. Every time I contact Panasonic, they keep sending me the same service center information. Still doesn't work. Time to cut my losses and put it in the trash. My Sharp lasted 10 years. Back to Sharp. Oh - the problem this time around is that it will not heat anything smaller than about a quart of water. Cannot reheat a mug of coffee as it cuts out after a few seconds ... it stops and clears all memory including the clock.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "This microwave only lasted 6 months before trouble started. At first, the Inverter cooking mechanism stopped working. Shortly thereafter, the entire microwave became intermittent. Sometimes pushing the start button worked, sometimes it did not. Another frustration with the product is the large amount of force that is needed to get the door open. You have to push the door button so hard that it moves the microwave. Quite a disappointing product overall. A product at this price level should do much better.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "I've waited to post a review on this microwave until we had it for at least a month and able to provide input based on daily use. After a little over a month of use the overall experience so far has been very positive. In looking for a microwave oven we were restricted in size due to a built-in area in our cabinets for a microwave. Because of this the microwave oven cannot be too big otherwise it will not fit in the space and this is frustrating because too many times small means cheap and poor performance. After a lot of research I happened across the Panasonic 681S and so we have been very satisified with the purchase. This microwave is replacing a GE microwave oven that we've had for about six years and the comparison in this review will be against this GE microwave oven. PROS of the Panasonic 681S to the GE: * The overall controls for the Panasonic microwave take some getting used to, but after a little use it's very easy to use and we actually prefer this control panel setup over the more \"standard\" setup of the GE. * Power - the Panasonic is much quicker at heating than the GE. We can now cook frozen items based on the package times and not have to add extra time to account for the poor performance of the GE. * Defrost mode - the Panasonic is much better at defrosting than any microwave we've ever owned. It does an excellent job at defrosting meat throughout without \"cooking\" the edges. This was something we always had to be careful of with the GE. * Popcorn - excellent job popping popcorn and really like the adjustment for various bag sizes. Even though the GE had a \"popcorn\" mode we always had to catch it at the end of its cycle and add an extra minute of time and then listen and stop it before the popcorn started to burn. * Baked Potatoes - the Panasonic does an excellent job with baked potatoes and again out performs the GE. * Easy to read display. * Looks nice. CONS of the Panasonic 681S to the GE: * No light when the door is opened. The interior light only comes on when he microwave is running and provides less light than the GE. * If weight is an indicator of overall construction and durability then the GE wins because it is much heavier than the Panasonic. However so far there is nothing to show the Panasonic is any less durable than the GE and in fact the GE's touch pad had to be replaced within the first three months of ownership. Time will tell on this point. * Stainless steel shows finger prints - but this would be a problem with ANY stainless steel appliance, but it looks great when it's clean. * For some reason this model of Panasonic microwave is hard to find. Seems to always be out of stock, or only in stock for a brief time. Not sure why this is. Overall we're pleased with this microwave oven and based on our experience to date for the money would recommend this for someone who is looking for a very good microwave oven in this size and price range.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "I purchased this product directly from Amazon only 4 days ago. I received it yesterday shipped from Amazon. Even though Panasonic sends a warranty form with instructions to register the product online, the warranty company ( Square Trade) declines the registration with the following reasons: -Products purchased over 10 months ago -Refurbished Products purchased over 90 days ago -Warranties with Drops & Spills coverage for which the product was purchased over 90 days ago -Expensive items that are over our price threshold -Like-new or refurbished items on select categories.

{"review": "The microwave functions fine, we bought it because we don't use our microwave too often and the one we had was a huge 1.6 cu/ft model that took up a ton of counter space. This smaller one gets the job done just fine as far as microwaving things go. The annoying part is that it doesn't sit flat on the counter. One of the plastic feet sits probably 1/2\" higher, and so it's lopsided and not steady on the counter top. I looked over everything on the bottom and the overall build, and nothing is dented or out of the ordinary. So to make it flat I had to make a little shim and glue it to the foot that's up higher so it doesn't wobble or sit crooked. This would've been a 5 star review basically because the price is right, it's small, and does what it's supposed to do, but gets docked 2 stars - 1 for missing out on what seems like a really basic thing of sitting flat, and 1 for the trouble of having to put something together to make it sit straight.", "id": "289935"}

{"review": "I bought this microwave oven over a year ago because I had just moved from another state, and my budget was tight. This one was inexpensive, and though the reviews were mediocre, I thought, \"How bad could it be? I just need it to heat things up now and then.\" My previous microwave, a Sharp, had also been incredibly cheap and its ratings hadn't been soaring, and yet it was the best microwave I'd ever had. I'm kicking myself for not keeping it. Because the same can NOT be said of this Sunbeam. Let's break it down. PROS It did heat food evenly, if slowly. CONS *Its feet weren't of equal height, so it sat at a perpetual slant *Once you set the timer, you can't see the time counting down unless you tap the Timer button again. This is frustrating when you need to check the time left, but your hands are full. *There's no quick cook button. It's not a crucial feature, and it's my fault for not checking for one before I bought it, but seriously - no 30-second or 60-second button? *There was nothing to secure the glass tray, which frequently slipped out of place and knocked against the walls of the microwave while cooking or even slid out of the microwave when I opened it. *It sounds like a jet taking off. Seriously. I've never had a microwave this loud before. *The door requires significant force to pull open, which often resulted in pulling the microwave forward several inches every time. *The defrost function is confusing, and honestly, I never really figured it out. I *thought* I was following directions, but the microwave would just beep angrily at me like I'd offended it for suggesting that I wanted to defrost anything over 1 pound. I kept it for over a year because I hated the thought of shopping for a microwave again, so I kept putting it off. Luckily for me, it died today. 16 months old, and it's already toast. I've just come back from buying a different microwave that I thoroughly vetted this time. So, thanks, Sunbeam, for teaching me a lesson, I guess.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "1) When not in use, the digital clock has a bright red LED that looks like a warning light but isn't and says \"clock\" in small letters. Other bright red LED's display while in use. These bright red status lights keep making it look like something is wrong. Their color should be a green or neutral color, since everything is working correctly and not an alarming red. 2) The door closes with a strong latch. The unit is so small that pulling on the door to open it pulls the whole unit forward. Need to push the unit back while pulling the door forward. Requires 2 hands or fancy one-handed maneuver to open. A top button latch would have worked better. 3) Heats very unevenly even with the rotating platter. On a plate with grated cheese, the center melted while areas off-center seemed unheated. 4) Poor internal light. Hard to see food because of shadows unless the food is on a flat plate. And then the platter turns too fast to see the food in detail. 5) Touch pad buttons aren't the most responsive or easy to press. 6) Menu is less than self explanatory, but in reality I only use \"time\" and \"start\" and skip the other feature buttons, probably even if I understood them. On the positive side, it is small and it does boil water.", "id": "289935"}

Some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn't seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism.

{"review": "After having read reviews for more expensive upmarket brand microwaves like LG and Panasonic, we went to our local (Canadian) Wal Mart to see what they had. The first thing I noticed about this one is that it is completely stainless steel: front AND back; outside and inside; all around. It looks like a professional food service microwave. To me, the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one. We have heard that microwave ovens don't last like they used to (we have one low quality unbranded OTR one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995 & still working as well as it ever did, and another LG 900 watt in an RV from 2004, also a good runner at this writing, July 2013). We didn't want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years. Well, with this Danby, we have a two year replacement warranty. If it dies before its time, we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one. Fair enough, I thought. There are not a lot of features here and it isn't super powerful. Certainly adequate but our LG 900 watt heats things up a bit faster and has more useful programs like casserole re-heat with 4 levels and programs for either fresh or frozen vegetables with different quantities. The Danby reheat button has only 3 minutes; no other options. For most cooking/reheating you have to punch in the time you guess is about right manually. Considering the price ($100 Canadian plus sales tax) and the two year replacement warranty ($10 from Wal Mart), we are pretty well pleased with this so far. We have never had a countertop microwave as big as this one so we had to get used to all the acreage it takes up.

{"review": "I met a gourmet couple once who were about to be married and agreed they both never wanted to own a microwave. It was beneath them. I do not think like this. And I cook 3 meals per day, minimum. Look, sometimes you just want to soften butter, reheat leftovers, defrost...let's face it. This is a good looking oven and it can be housed countertop or under cabinets as well. If you need a microwave oven with a vent on the bottom (a rarity but if you have a microwave oven OVER your stop top) this will not replace that one--know going in. Stainless steel, it looks sleek and stays clean well. The wattage is the first you will notice. It cooks faster. At over 1,200 watts, this is higher than many on the market and likely higher than one installed in any new home as wattage seems to be something many new home builders skimp on in my experience, but you will immediately notice things cook faster when you reach this level. Now let't get to the inverter technology...most microwaves defrost or cook on low by turning the microwave high temp on and off. In other words, it does not actually reduce the heat, it just cooks on high on and off. This new heating invention is on few microwaves but it was fun to try and a must-have once you see it in play. It actually cooks on a lower temperature! This means if you want to melt chocolate, for example, and don't want to break out the double boiler, but hate the burned chocolate around the edge of your bowl with the uncooked hard chocolate in the center? Now you got it. This showed even heating on low temps but even more even heating on high temperatures. Great for softening butter in a pinch for baking...melted butter will NOT work, so this gets it soft evenly. It offers a bigger size than many ovens as well at 2.2 cubic feet--meaning even my big casserole dish could have leftovers reheated within it and just popped in the microwave, lid on. Now sure it has your staples like the popcorn button and all, but how it COOKS is what you look for in an oven---it has your typical bells and whistles as far as microwaves go but being able to cook on low and do so evenly is not the norm and this one shines, then when you want to zap fast and high--that pizza is reheated pronto.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "I love this microwave! Along with being great doing the basic microwave stuff like heating up water, or making popcorn, it's fantastic when de-frosting! De-frosting is done evenly, so I didn't have the problem I usually have where parts of the food starts cooking before other parts are even thawed. Even cooking is the best part about this microwave in general. One thing I do nearly every morning in my microwave is make oatmeal. Generally, I have to keep a sharp eye on the bowl in the microwave, because oatmeal tends to bubble over if you're not careful. Since using this microwave, I have not had a bowl of oatmeal boil over on me. The directions were clear and easy to understand, and all the various features for this microwave are also clear and easy to understand. The one very minor negative I can see with this microwave is the size. For someone like me with a small kitchen, it's hard to find a place where it will fit! BUT this is also a positive, too, because it fits larger platters and bowls. So, if you have a smaller kitchen with not that much room, you might want to look at a smaller microwave, but if you have the room in your kitchen, this microwave is highly recommended. It's one of the best I've ever used.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "(Please note that this review is for the 2.2 cubic foot but Amazon combines both the 1.6 and 2.2 reviews on the same page) When it comes to microwaves, there is no doubt that there are many in the market, each offers something new and different or just the basic needs that people are looking for. But for those who are needing a new microwave or to upgrade, one may want to take a look at the Panasonic NN-SN973S 2.2 Cubic foot, 1250-Watt Inverter Microwave. Let's take a look at how this microwave works! I. THE MICROWAVE - FIRST IMPRESSIONS Upon receiving the shipment, I freaked out a bit because the box was huge (width wise) and wasn't sure if it would fit in our usual kitchen corner area where we keep our microwaves. But upon opening the box and placing the microwave in the corner, it fit just perfectly. The box comes with the microwave, the glass dish to go inside (and rotates) the microwave and instructions. My first impressions was how sleek the microwave looked with the steel trim and how it complimented our kitchen area. When I opened the microwave door, the first thing you notice is how spacious things are inside. Programming the new time was easy and some mentioned the light was dim, but it depends on the angle you are in but it's not so bad but some may like the bigger illumination of other microwaves...but I didn't mind too much with the illumination of this microwave, it was fine. I went ahead and made miso soup and noticed there is no large piercing sounds when it's done cooking. Our previous microwave would shoot out several audible beeps but this one, its short and quick. So, parents of newborns, shouldn't have to worry about the large repeated sounds of heating things up in the microwave. But the buttons are quite easy to use...sensor reheat, popcorn, sensor cook, keep warm, quick minute, Inverter Turbo Defrost. There is also a child lock. For the keep warm feature, it keeps food warm for up to 30 minutes after cooking. The Inverter Turbo Defrost Feature allows to defrost food by entering the weight. So, if it's 14-15 ounces, just hit the Inverter Turbo Defrost, hit 15 and hit start. Sensor Reheat allows to reheat cooked, refrigerated food without setting a time. Sensor Cook feature allows you to cook food without setting a time. You can select the desired food on the display window. Such as oatmeal, breakfast sausage, omelete, frozen entrees, frozen pizza, potatoes, fresh vegetables, pasta, fish fillet, etc. But for the most part, the microwave is easy to figure out. The instructions are quite detailed (in English and Spanish) and also comes with microwave recipes and how to clean your microwave. JUDGMENT CALL: Yes, there are new technology of microwaves out there. Some that toast and bake, some with televisions built inside it. But the Panasonic NN-SN973S 2.2 Inverter Technology Microwave Oven, 1250 watt is a microwave for those who want a microwave that is large and spacious inside, has buttons to choose what heating need to be done and don't want to randomly choose a number. If anything, the microwave makes things much easier for people to defrost and cook food. Enter the ounces for defrosting or enter a sensor cook by looking at the food display shown on the display screen. So, this microwave does try to take the guesswork out for some people who worry about those things but for the most part, this microwave looks stylish, very spacious and gets the job done! I have read other reviews about people who have had the latch broken off, I have never had that problem with this microwave but like anything similar to even a washer, slamming the doors can lead to broken latches. You have to be gentle with it and also remind the children to be gentle with how they close the doors. But I haven't had an issue with this for a microwave and hopefully never will. Panasonic does have an Inverter technology Microwave with Convection technology Panasonic NN-CD989S Genius \"Prestige\" 1.5 cuft 1100-Watt Sensor Convection Microwave with Inverter Technology, Full Stainless Steel but it is a bit pricey. But for those looking for a microwave with a lot of space and a microwave that takes a lot of the guesswork of cooking food in the microwave or defrost in the microwave and one that looks stylish, I do recommend the Panasonic NN-SN973S 2.2!

The big 15\" diameter turntable is a plus, but the speed with which it cooks is its best feature. The only disappointment is the relatively dim time display.....No excuse for that.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "We have had numerous microwaves since they fist made them and this is the poorest in construction of any. We thought we were buying a quality product. It is smaller than expected. We measured the one we were replacing and were surprised when it was smaller. Accepted we must have made an error and began learning the difficult use procedures (compared with unit we were replacing) and went forward with light use by 2 adults. The door began to require more and more pressure to close and eventually by 90 days required full force to close or slamming. A normal, gentle push to close like those in the past was no more! It finally has become unacceptable and is obviously worsening. Not available for Amazon replacement (missed by 2 weeks) and Panasonic requires we mail it to repair center at our cost and no idea how long it may take. We have a lot of Panasonic products, this will be our last. Cheap look, cheap construction, difficult procedures to memorize for sensor cooking. I rarely review, this was so bad it called for a warning to potential buyers.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "PROS- Large, variable power levels, sensor cooking, keep warm mode, can turn off beep, 1250 watts CONS- Large, hard-to-read buttons, mugs boil over, needs +30 sec button This microwave has a few cool features. Unlike previous microwaves I've had, it has variable power levels (instead of cycling on and then off for reduced power levels), supposedly yielding more even cooking. It also has sensor cooking which I find very handy (cook until done, as detected by steam sensors), and a keep-warm mode. I find that reheat is useful for most frozen vegetables, for example. However, the large size can make it hard to fit into a smaller kitchen. I had to rethink the arrangement of our kitchen counters in order to find a usable place for it. It protrudes 20.5 inches from the wall, which is almost as deep as my \"counter-depth\" refrigerator (and is 21.7\" wide). (In contrast, my old broken over-the-stove GE microwave protruded out 11 inches). Depending on your needs, its large size can be a plus or a minus. Since microwave time increases as the amount of food increases, microwaves don't have as much of an advantage over regular stoves/ovens with larger quantities. Given its high wattage, it would be nice if it had a +30 second button rather than the +1 minute button it does have. One problem I am having is that my mugs start boiling *before* the entire amount of stirred liquid becomes hot enough, so that if I am heating anything besides pure water, it boils over before being done. Instead, I have to heat up a mug partway, stir, then finish heating up. Seems like it is developing significant hot spots -- my old GE over-stove 1250 watt oven didn't have this problem. Another problem I have with this oven is that control buttons are hard to read. They are charcoal gray, with lighter metallic gray text (similar to the color of the stainless steel). The caps are about 1/8 inch high, and lower-case about half that, all on a black background (the product photo is lighter than they are in real life). Older eyes cannot read them without a strong flashlight, so for our household I have had to annotate the major buttons with stickers with large clear print. Also, the clock/display is not readable if you are looking at it from an angle. It is really nice that the beeps can be turned off on this model. (I have other appliances that beep way too much, and I often feel glad that I don't have any sleeping babies or day-sleeping shift-workers to be bothered by them.) Though the manual is good about microwave cooking in general, recipes are lacking -- I was hoping they would provide some good examples to take advantage of the larger capacity of this appliance. However, there are only five recipes: three noodle casseroles (two with precooked noodles, one with uncooked and extra water), shepherds pie, and omelet, that is it. I looked on the Panasonic website to see if there were more recipes that use a large microwave to good advantage, but only found a cookbook that they are selling. (If you're going to buy a microwave cookbook, Barbara Kafka's Microwave Gourmet would be a great choice for a wide variety of tasty recipes for microwave cooking in general.) The door appears to be brushed stainless steel and black plastic, but the sides are metallic gray painted sheet-metal (magnetic).", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "You may find reviews on this page complaining of a door latch failure within or just after warranty lapse. As with many Amazon pages, similar models of a product often have reviews mixed up on a page. Here I am talking about Panasonic Genius NN-SN773S 1.6 Cuft 1250 Watt with Inverter I had bought one of the Panasonic microwaves of this same variety in 2011 B000ON6HMS , which is NN-SD-797S and the door latch was loud and stiff right out of the box. It began showing signs of failing in mid-2013, so in October I bought this NN-SN773S. Considering the loud outcry on Amazon about that door latch problem, I was pretty sure it would be fixed in the next or following model-year. As far as I can tell right now, yes, IT WAS FIXED. I let it sit in the box as I figured I'd just use up the old one, but it would work after much repeated door slamming until the latch caught. I finally gave up and trashed it, opened the box for the new one and set it up. It has a totally redesigned control panel and door latch, and seems pretty standard/competitive with all other mid-size microwaves. The old one (797S) had a knob you had to turn to set the numbers. This one has a touch-pad. They are the same in dimensions and functions, so I only had to glance at the instructions to see how to set the clock -- was delighted that you set the clock simply by poking the clock button and punching in the numbers for the time. REASONS FOR JUST 4 STARS: The shape of the interior is just a hair too low to put in tall items with a lid. The control panel is BLACK -- and the button labels are not bright and big enough to read in a dim room;. When working, it's just a tich too LOUD -- not a lot, just a tiny bit. Maybe if installed in an overhead compartment, the sound wouldn't be so annoying. The BEEP when it's finished isn't loud or insistent enough -- but that doesn't irk me, personally. If this lasts longer, and defrosts, heats, and cooks as well after a couple of years, I'll be happy.; Meanwhile, the LOUD SLAM of a defective door is gone from my kitchen. This one, you just swing it to and push a little, and it latches like a normal microwave.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "My family loves this microwave, it is an awesome buy it cooks, thaws or warms in half the time. the inverter technology is a well thought out plan it make the wait less,it time consuming for the normal microwave cooking.I love the silver look I matches very well all the other items in the kitchen. I can fit my big glass platters in it with no problems of being to small.it thaws all the food, meats, etc.all at the same time, just I love it almost as much as the last Panasonic. there were a lot of short comings with the last one but of course it was fourteen years old. the only problem with this one is it has a lot of power, example, I had my roaster and microwave plugged up at the same time. it would trip the power cord. I tried several power cords brand new ones for multipurpose. they all fail so I had to put the roaster somewhere else. I love my microwave. it is a five star microwave.", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "This is a decent microwave but I only gave it three stars because its a little pricey for what it is and what it does. There are a lot of \"new\" fancy features but I have never been one to use a lot of those preset cooking features so for me, I would prefer one that does what it needs to do simply, easily and at a good price. For me, the two buttons I use the most are the \"miute plus\" and \"power\" buttons. My favorite microwave to date is a Kitchenaid that is no longer made where you simply hit MINUTE PLUS and it immediately starts to cook for a minute, hit MINUTE PLUS again to additional minutes. If you want to change the power setting, hit the POWER and each press reduces power by 10%. With this one, you hit MINUTE PLUS for the time you want then you have to hit START. If you want to change the power setting...too bad, you have to start over and do that first. Sorry, that little thing bugs me. Please also note that the stock image Amazon uses is not of the 1.6 cu. foot model (i assume that is the 2.2 cu foot model) from the specs that amazon has, the 1.6 cu foot model has an almost identical footprint as the 2.2 cu foot model but they have are a couple inches different in height. This can either be a plus or a minus (if you are like me and enjoy hot beverages in a tall glass, that might be a minus) Pros: + GOOD POWER - there are units out there with more power but i have found that 1200 watts is completely adequate for the average household. Unless you frequently like to cook an entire roast or chicken in the microwave I would take the energy savings of the lower wattage over the few seconds you may save cooking smaller items. + NICE CASE - this unit has a stainless front with a silver power coated case that covers the top and sides. This is great when you use this unit on the countertop. I have had other units that have a stainless front and black powder coating on the case. It looks horrible on the coutertop. +LOTS OF PRESET COOKING FUNCTIONS - I don't use these much but tried it...seems to work as it should +COUNTDOWN TIMER - easy to use and access countdown timer. You can 'thave too many timers in a kitchen Cons: - CANT SEE DISPLAY FROM COUNTER HEIGHT - I'm average height and when this unit is on the countertop, the display has horrible contrast. If you are looking at the display it has great contrast. I would suggest using a different type of display in the future that has much wider fields of view all vertically and horizontally -HARD TO SET TIME - I have never had to read a manual to set the clock...I had to do that for this one. Every time I tried to set the clock, I initiated the countdown timer", "id": "289935"}
{"review": "NOTE: at the time of writing this review, this microwave was offered directly from amazon at $79 + free shipping It is a simple microwave which offers most of the basic stuff. I usually use microwave either for defrosting or quick reheating . I don't often use the other functions; so for me, this has more than I can ask for. My old Emerson died after 4 years of use and I bought this as a replacement. After a few days of use my first impressions are as follows: Pros: 1-Offers the most frequently used functions at a decent price. You may want to go for the new inverter types from panasonic which claims to heat more evenly but I did not due to higher energy use and noise complained by most reviewers.Besides those fancy models cost at least $40 more. 2-Potato, pizza and weight based functions are good additions to the basic default reheat function. 3-It has a stylish color, does not look cheap at all... good combination to my other kitchen items that are also in tones of gray. 4- Although it is the same cubic feet volume as my old one, It is a little shorter than my previous one but has a wider base so the turning plate is wider. This may help putting bigger dishes in while being shorter does not actually limit at all. 5- According to the manual, it has a programmable child lock to prevent unsupervised use. I have not used that function but it is good to know that it exists. Cons: 1- No switch on/off button. I think this is common problem for all microwaves in USA, you either need to unplug it to switch it off (not practical and not recommended) or use an outlet switch. So in standby position it will keep sucking up electricity. Besides, that is the only way its clock operates. So if you disconnect it from the plug, you need to set the time again, which I don't care because I don't use the time function anyway. The good news is that it does not suck up much energy while its in standby position. Kill a watt measured 0.4 watts on average so if you keep it plugged 24 hours a day for 365 days a year, then your annual electricity bill will only rise 42 cents which is negligible. 2- The biggest problem I have observed so far is that it slips badly on the countertop. So I had to put some non-slide stuff beneath its feet. Without it you will struggle a lot keeping it in place (I would never put it close to the edge of the countertop, it may commit suicide by jumping off.) 3- This one is very minor but still worth mentioning: You can not change the power while it is operating, you either need to wait until the cycle ends or cancel it. Besides to change the power you have to first set the duration only then you can change the power output (it is somewhat funny) (By the way another reviewer commented that you can not add time to the existing program while it is working but that is not true! while it is turning you can press the +30 sec button and it adds 30 sec to the program, press twice it adds a minute etc.) Over all, my first impressions are mostly adequate. The big question is whether it will last. I can not say for sure but I have other Oster devices which I have been using with no problems for quite sometime so for that case I trusted the company name but time will show. I can recommend this product to people like me who want the basic microwave functions without breaking the bank.", "id": "289935"}

{"review": "It's not a terrible microwave, but they did cut corners on the design and manufacturing. The display is very basic and almost cool in a retro way.

The numbers aren't express cooking minutes, they always enter time to cook (to cook one minute press 1 - 0 - 0 - start instead of just 1). All of that I could deal with though given the price and that it looks good and the door lever seems solid, which is a common failure point for many microwaves. Unfortunately this unit trips my house breaker sometimes even though it's 100 watts less than the old microwave. It also puts out more interference than the old one... causing bluetooth headset static within 7 feet while my old microwave didn't cause interference unless you were within 1 foot. The worst of all though is that microwave safe plates and bowls get hotter than in my old microwave.

As I'd mentioned in my review for the TDS* water meter/tester, my tap water is hard so I used the baseline measurement (PPM's) of a bottle of Poland Spring water. My main concern about this filter or my refrigerator water line in general, was that it wasn't going to make too much of a difference drinking water from the tap versus one that came out of this filter. After my baseline measurements, my concerns were put at ease. Below are results from my tests: (measurements in PPM) 0-50 = Ideal drinking water 50-100 = Carbon filtered water 100-200 = Hard water 200-300 = Marginally acceptable 200-400 = Average tap water 400+ Very high TDS contaminant level --My household baseline-- Bottle of Poland Spring = 18 Tap Water = 281 Gatorade = 260 5 month old filter from my refrigerator water line = 240 New filter from my refrigerator water line = 200 Melted ice (4 hours) = 293 So what did I learn from this...

If you've got a refrigerator that uses one of these filters and the water's been coming out slow then it's probably time for a new filter. One word of advice: use a big water pitcher for the first use of the dispenser after the filter change - the pressure has to readjust and it will spit out a few huge blasts of water that will overwhelm your normal water glass. After the couple of big blasts though, you get constant good pressure, better than you remembered was even possible after the gradual slow down with your old filter.", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "This filter is rated at 750 gallons capacity. If the consumer uses one gallon of water per day in the form of water from the refrigerator dispenser and ice from the ice dispenser, the filter will last 750 days; i.e., just over TWO years. In general, there is no reason to replace the filter yearly, unless you have a really yuccky water source. In a small household of two adults, the filter should last considerably longer than two years. Furthermore, with the addition of a filtered water dispenser at the sink (such as a GE undercounter unit), the refrigerator filter would be functional for a few years.

{"review": "Lots of reviews on this site refer to the confusion regarding this replacement filter (UKF8001), so here are my observations on two matters: 1.) Which filter are we getting (750 Gallons vs 200 Gallons, etc) when we buy UKF8001? 2.) How frequently should we change it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gallon Capacity Rating ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Like everyone else, my box lists two different capacities (750 Gallon Rating & 200 Gallon Rating) * Underneath each gallon rating it says the number of contaminents reduced (12 & 17 respectively) * As others have shown in their photos, immediately below that, it lists a number of contaminents, with a checkmark as to whether the filter for that gallon rating filters each of the contaminents. Note that for the 750 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 12 and chlorobenzene is not checked. Note that for the 200 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 17 and cholorbenzene IS checked. Now, here's the key observation. On the front of my box it says in a bright pink callout \"Reduces 12 contaminents...\" Note that it does not say 17 contaminents, but 12. Also it does not mention chlorobenzene. From this I take it that UKF8001 filter that I received is rated 750 gallons, and does not filter chlorobenzene. I assume that if the filter were rated for 200 gallons and filtering chlorobenzene, then the box would be labeled on the front as filtering 17 contaminents, but I cannot prove this. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has a box that has such a designation on the front to see how their box differs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Change at 6 months or 12 months ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Regarding changing the filter at 1 yr vs 6 months, here's what my refrigerator manual said about that: \"The filter monitor system measures the amount of water that passes through the filter and alerts you to replace the filter. When 90% of the filter's rated life is used, the yellow (Order) light comes on. When 100% of the filter's rated life is used, the red (Replace) light comes on, and it is recommended that you replace the filter. For models without filter status lights, replace the filter every 6 months. Use replacement filter model 67003523; order Part Number 4396395.\" From this I take it that some refrigerators are advanced enough to measure the amount of water that has passed through the system and to make recommendations as to when to change the filter. To determine this, you would need to check your fridge manual. If your refrigerator has such a feature, then you can probably go by the fridge's recommendation. Also, I suspect some fridges just go by the date and alert you after 6 months or a year. Or for those fridges that have a usage monitoring system, perhaps they alert you after six months or a year even if you haven't reached your maximum capacity rating. For example, I have an advanced fridge with the capacity monitor. I installed UKF8001 the last two times, and each time the fridge has indicated a need to change the filter at just about 1 yr, even though there is no way we used 750 gallons in that time frame. Probably this is to ensure the filter gets changed regularly whether you have met the usage profile or not. Regarding the fact that the box is stamped at 6 months even though it can be used for a full year and is rated at 750 Gallons, here's my theory. The filter manufacturer says that without a usage monitoring feature, their recommendation is 6 months. Probably the manufacturer stamps 6 months on the outside of the box since that is the shortest and most generic case (and also so they can sell more filters. Lol.) But the frequency you should change the filter will depend on your particular fridge, your usage, and your water quality. Finally, although the filter works just fine, I deducted one point from the rating because the packaging causes so much needless confusion.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "This water filter produces great tasting water! I have always been a fan of Pur water filtration systems, so with this filter you get the great taste of Pur filtered water right out of your refrigerator. It lasts about 1 year and then a red light on the refrigerator comes on indicating that it is time to swap out the water filter. To be honest, the water didn't really taste bad at the year marker, so you might be able to get the filter to last longer than that. Can't say for sure, though, since we have always gone ahead and swapped it out anyways. It is super easy to install. It depends on your refrigerator, but on our Maytag the filter is on the inside of the refrigerator in the top back right corner. You open the filter door by pushing in the tab. Then turn the filter counter-clockwise to unscrew it. The filter will have some remaining water in it, so make sure that you keep it tilted up or you will have some water to wipe up. The new filter comes in shrink wrap plastic, so you take that off and then peal off the seal that covers the top of the filter. Insert the new filter where the old one was and turn clockwise to tighten. Don't over tighten it. Just get it snug. You will hear water rush into the filter as you are screwing it in. Then close the filter door. Last thing is to let some water run through the lines to remove all the air. I took a 1 gallon jug and just let the water fill it up. The instructions recommend running 4 gallons through to make sure you removed all the air. I only did 1 gallon and it seemed to be more than enough. That's it! Now you can just sit back and enjoy some clean filtered water. If you figure the price of buying bottled water vs. a new filter once a year, this is definitely a good deal at an average cost of about $2.50 a month.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "Overall we have found this to be a great water filter. But we have had our water tested by a professional, both at the tap, and at the filtered tap on the refrigerator. Both waters tested the same for chlorine content, however, the particle contaminants were greatly reduced by the filter on the refrigerator. Something to note on your water filter. The light is merely a timed indicator of when they want you to replace the filter. Think of it as a \"countdown timer\" that starts as soon as you reset it. It is in no way measuring the amount of water you are consuming... Personally, I used to change out the filter every 6 months when the indicator light came on, but we rarely use the water/ice now, so I haven't changed it (or reset it) in over a year although I probably will soon. I actually cut the first one in half to see how \"contaminated\" the filter was and to my surprise, it looked like a brand new filter... The life of a filter depends on a couple of things. 1. The amount of contaminants in your water (well water is typically the worst) 2. The amount of water that passes through the filter If you have low contaminants and/or use very little filtered water, your filter will last much longer than 6 months. If you pay attention to the amount of water flow and the size of your ice cubes, you can more accurately determine the proper time to replace the filter. I have county water and we also have installed a \"whole house\" water filtration system, so I can probably get closer to 2 years out of a filter. Obviously, not everyone has these installed though, just use common sense on when to replace your filter and you'll be fine. P.S. Why is it more expensive per unit to buy the 3-pack than it is to buy the 2-pack? Am I the only one that found this odd?", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "We purchased a new Whirlpool refrigerator earlier this year. The new refrigerator has all the marvelous improvements developed in the last ten years for refrigerators, including a water filter. The water filter really does deliver better water. However, the water filter seems quite expensive to me. Whirlpool, and other manufacturer's that use this type of filter, recommend the filter be replaced twice a year, whether you need to replace the filter or not. The filter is relatively easy to replace, but be aware of what happens when you pull the filter. To remove the old filter you push a button next to the filter, typically to the left of the filter. Then pull on the cap covering the filter and pull the filter out. Make a note of how the filter was oriented when you pull it out. The filter will now begin dripping water, so have a paper towel or small bowl available to let the water drip into. You can either let the filter finish dripping into a sink, or throw it into a plastic bag that you can seal to keep the water from dripping out of the bag. Be sure you remove the cover from the filter before you toss it. On our Whirlpool the cover twists counterclockwise for removal. Install the filter cover onto the new filter. It takes just a twist to lock it into place. Holding the filter so that the two straight pieces on the end of the filter are vertical, with the open portion of the filter cover oriented on the bottom, slide the new filter straight into the filter cavity until the button on the left clicks to let you know the new filter is locked into place. Note that these instructions are for a Whirlpool, but I believe most other refrigerators are similar. You should be ready to go! Had I known refrigerator water filters were so expensive I might have gone with a refrigerator without one, though our local water has a lot of chlorine in it (which is filtered out by the filter). As with many modern conveniences, this water filter represents a convenience that you did not know you needed until you had it. Now that I have it, I am wondering whether I want it since I have to spend a chunk of change each year in filter replacements. Oh well. I guess I can sleep more soundly knowing that the water filter is now removing a bunch of stuff from my water that my body either did not want or need. Good luck!", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "Since I had had previous experience with Pur water filters, we purchased a side-by-side water and ice dispenser Whirlpool fridge over a year ago that uses these filters and they have made a huge difference in the quality of our water. We live in Riverview, FL, a suburb of Tampa, and the water here is so foul that I sometimes wonder if I have an odor from it after I shower. Since it smelled that bad coming from the tap I knew I was not going to drink it, cook with it, nor give it to my cats. So, to save us the expense of buying bottled water, we bought the fridge. Yes, the filters are expensive, but they are Pur water filters which, in my opinion, are better than Brita. I would rather have the expense than get sick drinking nasty water. Since I use the filtered water for just about everything, I have to replace my filter more frequently, but it is well worth the cost. To save a few bucks, I order my filter online and three at a time; this usually saves me $3-5.00 per filter. Just search for the item number of the filter and you will find several places that sell it either as a single, a three-pack, a four-pack or a six-pack.

{"review": "I have purchased this refrigerator filter several times before from other sources, and have never had a problem. This time I found Amazon had the best price, so I bought here and even signed up for the subscription service, which gave me a 15% discount and would automatically reorder the item every 6 months. The item arrived, and I waited until my then-current filter needed replacing. At that time I got out the new filter and tried to install it. I have done this with replacement filters before and it's always been quick and easy. This time I removed the old filter, took off the cap and placed it on the new filter, and tried inserting the new filter. The new filter went all the way in but would not catch and stay in, it kept popping back out. I switched back to the old filter and it went in just fine. I tried this repeatedly, as did a friend, and we always got the same result. I tried to request a replacement online at Amazon, but was unable to do so because it was past the 30-day deadline after the purchase. I searched all over the site and found no way to contact an actual person to explain the situation. I contacted Whirlpool directly twice, and both times was told they could do nothing about my defective item because I had ordered through Amazon. Today on a whim I Googled \"contact amazon.com\" and found a phone number. After a lengthy discussion the end result was that Amazon will let me return the item, but will charge me a restocking fee. The kicker is, they won't tell me what the fee is, they expect me to just return the item and then they will refund whatever amount is left after that fee. Despite my pointing out what a ridiculous practice that is, and mentioning that I will both cancel my subscription and post a negative review, that was the best I could get them to do. So now I am posting this review and will cancel my subscription for future filter purchases. I have bought literally hundreds of items online over the past couple decades, and am really surprised that a company claiming to have such great customer service is responding this way. I don't think I've ever posted a negative review before, but I want others to know that if they buy this item direct from Amazon, they need to check it right away even if they won't be using it for a while, or risk getting stuck with a defective item, no refund/replacement, and lots of time wasted.

{"review": "Late last year I bought a fancy Samsung refrigerator - the model RF4289HARS. It is the one with the 4 doors (actually two French doors on top, a middle drawer, and a bottom freezer drawer. It has the water and ice dispenser on the left French door just under the snazzy blue led lighted touch control panel. Anyway, the change filter light came on and so I removed the filter (it is really easy, just unscrew it a half turn and it comes right out) so I could see what the replacement part number on it said. It was DA-29-00020A. After looking around the internet, and looking on the Samsung website I found that there is no such part number - the closest thing I found was almost the same number only ending with B instead of A. I called Samsung and after getting bounced to 3 different customer service people who had no idea whether part DA-29-00020A was the correct replacement for part DA-29-00020B and one customer service person who did not know that the filters are supposed to be changed after a while, I found a person who was able to tell me that DA-29-00020B is in fact the correct replacement filter for refrigerator model RF4289HARS. I bought two of these filters - one to install now and one for a spare. I put one in (it takes about 5 seconds to insert it and give it a half twist to the right to install it, and then I followed the instructions of running about a gallon of water through it. You really do need to run this amount of water through it so get all of the air out of it so you get a smooth stream of filered water coming out. I then reset the change filter light - you have to do this manually but all it takes is pressing and holding for 5 seconds (not the 3 seconds they tell you) the child lock/filter reset spot on the bottom left corner of the touch control screen just above the water/ice dispenser. It works great now - tasty filtered water and flavorless crushed ice from my fancy refrigerator any time I want it.", "id": "3741181"}

However, I've found it to be a relatively simple affair: the reusable filter doesn't drip when you remove it, and takes about 30 seconds to rinse out after each use. You can use it again right away to brew successive cups. One caveat is that the output splashes a bit when using the My K-Cup filter, so I always have a damp paper towel at the ready when I brew a cup.

{"review": "The Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter will let you make a great cup of coffee using your own coffee instead of the expensive pre-packaged K-cups. However, in order to get decent results you need to take a few initial steps. First, and most important, you need to adjust the gasket on your Keurig machine. If you look up under the lid at the \"nail\" (the sharp water spout that punctures the commercial K-cups), you'll see a black rubber gasket around it. PULL THAT DOWN about a centimeter (don't pull it all the way off). This gasket provides the seal necessary to prevent the pressured water from squirting out the top of the K-cup. The filter assembly sits a bit lower than commercial K-cups, so it doesn't make good contact with the gasket, causing hot water to leak and splash onto the counter and into your coffee. Pulling the gasket down will prevent this from happening. Doing this once will be sufficient for subsequent uses of the filter (the filter assembly will push the gasket back up the \"nail\" to the optimal position), but you may need to do it again after using a commercial K-cup (you can test it with an empty filter to see if it splashes so that you don't waste coffee if it does). THIS SHOULD BE IN THE MANUAL, under troubleshooting if nothing else. I found out by calling Keurig customer support. If you do not experience splashing or leaking then you may not need to do this step. Second, as mentioned elsewhere, you may want to insert the outer sleeve of a used commercial K-cup inside the filter housing (outside the filter) in order to provide a smaller exit hole for the water and thus give the hot water more time to brew a stronger cup of coffee. Simply use an X-acto or sharp blade to cut around the rim of a used K-cup (just under where it gets wider at the top). The top of the K-cup should come away with the paper filter intact, leaving you with the bottom part of the K-cup with the needle puncture. Slide this into the filter assembly and you are all set. It should hug the wall of the filter assembly and the filter will fit easily inside it. Kind of a pain, but you only have to do it once. Third, you may want to use a finer grind of coffee. I haven't experimented too much with this, so I don't know how fine is too fine for the mesh, but I've noticed that some of the pre-ground coffee we have that has a coarser grind makes a much weaker cup in the Keurig, even with the used K-cup sleeve inserted. However, the coffee we have with a finer grind makes a cup that's more consistent with what we get in our regular machine. Some other things you should know: After brewing, you simply remove the filter assembly and rinse it out. I recommend running warm water into the hole in the top at first to bring down the temperature of the grounds and any water remaining inside. Then, unscrew the top and rinse out the filter and the assembly, and you're ready for your next cup. I've found that it's easier to rinse the filter if I ONLY rinse it from the outside (turn it on its side and turn it under a strong stream of water, letting the grounds run out the top). Running water into the top of the filter tends to push the grounds into the mesh, requiring additional/stronger rinsing from outside to dislodge them. As mentioned elsewhere, the filter assembly is designed to go in the place of the spout assembly that comes with your Keurig machine. For this reason (along with the gasket issue), this is not an ideal solution for those that want to switch back and forth a lot between home ground coffee and commercial K-cups. The filter basket can accommodate about 2.5 tablespoons of coffee. There are little marks on the inside of the filter for each tablespoon. Although it took some initial troubleshooting and experimenting, I'm now able to get as consistent a cup of coffee using my own grounds as I ever was using my regular coffee maker and I'm very happy with it. I'd give it five stars except for the following: I took one off for the fact that going back and forth between regular K-cups and the filter is a bit of a hassle, and I took another off for the fact that I had to take apart a K-cup in order to overcome a design flaw.", "id": "3741181"}

I haven't experimented too much with this, so I don't know how fine is too fine for the mesh, but I've noticed that some of the pre-ground coffee we have that has a coarser grind makes a much weaker cup in the Keurig, even with the used K-cup sleeve inserted. However, the coffee we have with a finer grind makes a cup that's more consistent with what we get in our regular machine. Some other things you should know: After brewing, you simply remove the filter assembly and rinse it out. I recommend running warm water into the hole in the top at first to bring down the temperature of the grounds and any water remaining inside. Then, unscrew the top and rinse out the filter and the assembly, and you're ready for your next cup. I've found that it's easier to rinse the filter if I ONLY rinse it from the outside (turn it on its side and turn it under a strong stream of water, letting the grounds run out the top). Running water into the top of the filter tends to push the grounds into the mesh, requiring additional/stronger rinsing from outside to dislodge them. As mentioned elsewhere, the filter assembly is designed to go in the place of the spout assembly that comes with your Keurig machine. For this reason (along with the gasket issue), this is not an ideal solution for those that want to switch back and forth a lot between home ground coffee and commercial K-cups. The filter basket can accommodate about 2.5 tablespoons of coffee. There are little marks on the inside of the filter for each tablespoon. Although it took some initial troubleshooting and experimenting, I'm now able to get as consistent a cup of coffee using my own grounds as I ever was using my regular coffee maker and I'm very happy with it. I'd give it five stars except for the following: I took one off for the fact that going back and forth between regular K-cups and the filter is a bit of a hassle, and I took another off for the fact that I had to take apart a K-cup in order to overcome a design flaw.", "id": "3741181"}
{"review": "After reading many reviews about the problems with the My K-Cup and experimenting on my own, I have found an easy solution to the problem of weak coffee using this filter. As others have noted, the water goes through the My K-Cup way too fast as compared to the K-Cups. My solution was to take apart a K-Cup and use the outer plastic shell with the My K-Cup filter. Here's all you need to do: Take a used K-Cup and cut the top foil off of a K-Cup. Cut the paper filter out of the K-Cup. It's okay not to cut it all the way off of the rim of the K-Cup because you will need to cut the top of the K-Cup (where it gets wider at the top). You need to cut the top of the K-Cup off because you need to fit the K-Cup shell into the My K-Cup holder. Once you slide the bottom shell of the K-Cup into the holder, you can add your coffee into the My K-Cup (tapping or gently pressing the coffee so that it is not loose inside the filter). Then place the My K-Cup filter into the holder and cover as normal. When brewing, the K-Cup shell surrounds the My K-Cup filter and slows down the water by making it pass through the punctured hole that the prepackaged K-Cup normally uses. The great thing about this is that you can re-use the K-Cup shell that you cut apart over and over so once you have cut one apart you don't have to worry about it again- use the My K-Cup as you normally would. I'm hoping Keurig will have figured this out in the near future and add a premade piece that is included the My K-Cup, but until then, I have found that this solves the problem of weak coffee.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "So I, like everyone else, bought the Keurig because it was the only unit on the market that offered the choice of either using the proprietary coffee pods or your own coffee. I am a heavy user (grad student) and would simply not be able to afford the actual k-cups all the time. I now keep them around for visiting friends or those days when I need to brew a quick cup before going somewhere (of course I splurge every now and then and have a couple of cups of Coffee People Jet Fuel or Black Tiger). My K-Cup has saved me loads of cash and to date, it has lasted 6 months of heavy use (6 to 10 cups per day) I am not sure how folks are breaking theirs regularly. Below are some hints that I use for brewing a strong cup of coffee. 1. Best Cup of Coffee. First you must start with good coffee to brew good coffee. Max-house just isn't going to do the trick. The strongest mass-market brand I have found is Folgers Black Silk which may be good for those who like it semi-strong. I find, however, that purchasing premium coffee by the pound is still much cheaper than the branded k-cups. For real strong coffee you should experiment with \"SB\" Italian Roast, French Roast and Espresso Roast found in your local grocery store or here on Amazon. Not to mention if you read the coffee bag closely you will discover that an empty bag can be traded for free cup at your local SB store. I also find that if I buy the bag in whole bean and use the store's self-serve grinder to grind it down to the setting right between drip (course grind) and espresso (fine grind), I get a better brew out of the My K-cup. Be advised however, at the bottom of your coffee cup will likely have some very fine grinds in it (not at all like getting regular grounds in your coffee, these will be very fine and mostly noticeable by sight alone when all the coffee is gone). 2. Rapid Fire Use of a Single My K-cup. Now, everyone knows that when the big name coffee chain store makes your espresso, they do not wash out the little handle thing that the grounds go in. instead, they simply bang it in the trash and refill it with fresh grounds and then brew. So why would we insist on rinsing with water every time we want to make a successive cup of coffee. Instead, here is what I do: Take the filter basket over to your trash can and hold it upside down with two fingers. Now flick the plastic between the screens (all 4 of them) a time or two. Then give one final flick on the bottom and it should be clean enough to simply fill it back up again and brew another cup. For the first brew of the day, I usually do a full cleaning of My K-Cup. An additional hint is that I bought a nice stainless steel canister to hold my bulk bought coffee and I use a stainless steel teaspoon measuring spoon as my scooper. Using a teaspoon scooper allows me to get coffee into the filter basket without getting it all over the sides of My K-cup and the counter.", "id": "3741181"}

But the result is a great cup of coffee and no guilt trip about filling the landfill with punched out K-Cups. And if you're feeling reckless, it's an easy switch back to those good ol' prefab cups. I'd recommend this to anyone with a compatible brewer. It's not that much more of a hassle to use, the results are excellent, and there's no waste. Oh yeah, it's also a whole lot cheaper to fill these with your favorite pre-ground GMCR blend (Dark Magic baby!) than to buy the equivalent number of cups.

Oh, wait...mine didn't HAVE directions. When I first got it, I won't lie...I screwed it all up. The blasted thing didn't have directions, so I thought the cute little basket went right into the K-cup part of the Keurig. I had not a clue that the black K-cup holder part with the needle that pokes the bottom of the K-cup had to come OUT of my Keurig to put the gray part in. I made a huge mess. So, here are the directions for everyone else, so you don't have to be a dummy like me: 1. That place in your Keurig where K-cups normally go? Yeah, it actually comes out of the machine. Really, it does. There are three little tabs you have to push on the rim of it to pull it out. Get that thing out of there. It's not difficult, so if you're being rough with it, stop. It comes out pretty easily. Be careful you don't gouge yourself with the stabby-thingies in the machine. 2. Open up your reusable gray K-cup filter, wash it, and put about a tablespoon of coffee in there. If you like it strong like me, I suggest a finer grind. If you use Folgers, put it on a smaller cup setting or you won't get it very strong. This little bugger is made for just one cup at a time (whereas I can usually get one big cup or two little cups out of a disposable K-cup). 3. PUT THE LID BACK ON (!!!) the gray K-cup filter and put it into the spot where the regular black one usually lives (amazing, it fits!). Close it up and let 'er rip. 4. If you got coffee everywhere, you did something wrong. I know, I know...I didn't want to believe it either. Maybe you didn't put the lid on, or put the cute little basket into the machine without the gray part. Whatever. Either way, it's not the product's fault that you're dumb like me. :o) Start over, figure out what you messed up, and enjoy your coffee when you finally have that forehead-slap moment.", "id": "3741181"}

The design is completely different from a k-cup, with the water flowing practically straight through the device and picking up very little flavor from the coffee grounds. I just scanned through 30 pages of reviews on this item and managed to root out a few possible things to try before we give up on it(which I really don't want to do because I can't stand using all of that plastic that can't be recycled). 1 - Take a used, disposable K-Cup and cut it to size so that it can drop into the bottom of the My K-Cup.

Basically, this slows down the water's ability to leave the My K-Cup to the speed of an actual K-Cup, allowing for the water to actually pick up flavor from the coffee grounds. 2 - Use coffee that finely ground and somewhat packed into the filter (after having placed the cut piece of the disposable K-cup in the bottom). Here's hoping it works!

This will get rid of any loose carbon dust. The manual explains all this. According to the manual, 1 filter should last 6-8 weeks, depending on your pump speed and how quickly your animal(s) go through the water. I change mine every 2 months, sometimes longer. Now, I *clean* the whole fountain every 5-6 days, taking apart the whole thing, dumping out the old water, giving it a good scrubbing with soap and hot water. I take the lid off first, clean it, and rest the filter on the lid while I clean the rest of the fountain. Then I put the same filter back in, unless it's due for a change. $10 for a 3-pack that lasts 6 months is a good deal to me. Don't know how the other user had such problems with grime and slime.

{"review": "Since I already posted a review for the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain, I am going to keep this review focused on the product itself, which is the new and improved filter. I can't say that I was all that thrilled with the previous filter for use with the older version of the Drinkwell Pet Fountain. It was always producing a lot of charcoal in my cats water and although it didn't hurt him, I still didn't like the site of all that \"garbage\" in the bottom of his water dish. Also, the old filters didn't seem to do that good of job of filtering out the water. I don't know if it was just me, but I didn't like them all that much. Now we jump forward to the other day when I got the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain for my cat's eighth birthday, which he was simply overjoyed with and stuck his entire face in the stream to get the first drink. These new filters seem to do a much better job at filtering out the water as it circulates throughout the system. I have yet to see any charcoal in the bottom of his dish, nor anywhere else for that matter. I would definitely recommend that you buy several of these three-packs of replacement filters and be sure and change them frequently depending upon the condition of your local water. Some places have a harder water than others and therefore should replace the filters more often. Shawn Kovacich 100% Cat Lover", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "For our two cats we have a Platinum Drinkwell Fountain. We also live in a VERY hard water area.. There is nothing about the fountain or the filters that will \"soften\" the water, that is not what they're for. The idea is to get cats--descended from North African Desert animals---to drink more water. Its better for their kidneys; they'll likely live longer. ( A high percentage of older cats die from kidney failure, it is very common. Many veterenarians now are encouraging the use of some canned or \"wet\" cat food in a cat's diet to provide more moisture, since most cats aren't big on drinking....thats in part what all this is about.) As other posters have commented, my former cats always wanted the tap water on a \"thin\" drip or flow of water. It had to be \"just so\"...not too much, not too little...but they preferred drinking that water over their water in bowls, no matter how often the bowls were changed/cleaned. (Yes, I tried glass, ceramic, stainless steel, every recommendation about what type of bowls cats are said to prefer...) When the cat water fountains first came out I was skeptical at first...but it made sense, obviously this re-created what the cats preferred. The running water, the sound....so I got one. The critical element after buying the fountain is maintaining it. READ the directions! Change the filters \"every 2-4 weeks depending on the size and number of pets using the fountain\". Thats from the back of the Drinkwell filter package. And please use Drinkwell filters if you have a Drinkwell fountain! They are made to work together. Also follow the directions regarding rinsing off the excess charcoal off the filters with cold water before insertion into the Drinkwell machine. It is a good filter, but you must follow the directions. CLEAN the fountain...including the little parts around the motor. We take it apart about every other week and put the entire fountain, minus motor, in the upper section of the dishwasher, and run it, with the usual dishwashing detergent, which works great. The motor area can be cleaned with q-tips or the special brushes sold by Drinkwell. If the fountain is not kept clean and the fiilters are not replaced, the whole thing will stop working, though long before that your cats will be drinking recycled dirty water. This isn't hard, just a bit of reminding yourself. Just like with your car, there is basic cleaning and maintenance required. Also, reading some other posters: please don't use BLEACH to clean the fountain...plastic of all kind (think Tupperware) absorbs odors, I can't imagine a cat with his/her sensitive nose drinking water after the unit the cleaned w/ bleach, no matter how dilute. Also the vinegar and water thing....thats better than bleach but are you really cleaning the unit? Not that it has to be sterilized....just cleansed the way you would your family's dishes and glasses. BTW we also keep a bowl of water available too, \"just in case\".", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "Ok, so I clean my Drinkwell Platinum Fountain Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz and put the unit back on the floor. I lay down on the coach to take a nap. Next thing I know I have 3 paws whacking me upside the head and I hear, \"Hello Mcfly, you did not change the dang filter and now the water is running over the top of the filter.\" So I get up and check out the filter. Low and behold the cats were correct. I did not change the filter and the water just ran over the top and went to the basin without being filtered. Now this was the 5th time in 6 weeks I had cleaned the unit. Basically it took 5-6 weeks for the filter to clog up. As the 3 amigos stared at me like I was a complete idiot I proceeded to replace the old filter with a new one from my stock I had purchased on Amazon. Once the new filter was in place, the 3 amigos all took their turns playing in the water, only pausing to give me the look of, \"next time don't be such a dingbat,\" then proceeding to continue their frolicking. So here is the skinny on the filters. They really don't consist of much other than a fibrous trapezoid shaped to fit in your Drinkwell filter slot. They do have a black carbon side with some carbon granules between both sides that is supposed to remove odor from the water. How much odor it takes out I cannot say. But I am sure it does help. These filters will not take out anything that would be considered harmful like hard metals or even any minerals. They are not made for that purpose. They are made to keep things like hair or food particles from recirculating. And they function quite well for that purpose. Length of life simply depends on how many cats you have, how fast the filtration flow is, and how dirty your cats are. Over time I have noticed that my usage, with 3 playful kittehs, varies between 4-6 weeks. Now one of my cats thinks he is a raccoon. He is constantly taking his food over the water and cleaning it. Ok, he may just be playing with it, but he does take it over to the Drinkwell unit and puts the food in the water and then proceeds to bat it around. I also have another cat that likes to use his paws to bring the water from the waterfall to his mouth. For these reasons I tend to get a lot of cat hair in my fountain. Most is stopped by the hard plastic \"pre-filter\" but some does get by. This likely has an effect on my filters lifespan. I highly recommend these filters. As I have yet to find a generic brand for these filters you really don't have much of an option, unless you want to make your own. I make my own fish tank filters, but I have a basket/case made for the filtration materials to fit in. I have never seen anything like that for these filters. For that reason you really do not have much option other than using these, unless you want to somehow create your own basket to put your filtration media into. That being said, these filters do what they are intended to do. Watch for these to be on sale in bulk. I have found a 12 month supply (12 filters/4 - 3 packs) Drinkwell Platinum Premium Filters, 12-Pack for a good price at different times. The price does fluctuate so you have to watch it. Sometimes it is cheaper to purchase them just 1 package at a time and sometimes it is better to purchase them in bulk.", "id": "3741181"}

I am going to do a kitchen remodel in 4 months and I'm getting all my supplies lined up way ahead in case something is wrong or doesn't work right. I set this hood on my kitchen table and plugged it in to test the noise level(because they don't tell you on the page what the dba/sones are for the product in use). This is a VERY QUIET MACHINE and the cubic feet per minute(cfm) is excellent. With 4 speed levels and adjustable lights, they tilt back and forth, this exhaust hood rivals all that I've looked at.

{"review": "I used this to replace an over-range microwave that didn't work properly and had a fan that produced more noise than airflow. I shopped all over, and this was half the price or less of competitive products. I just finished installing it today, used it while cooking dinner this evening, and thus far I'm pretty happy with it. I'd say it looks comparable to some of the $1000 range hoods I looked at. I have a few minor nits, but nothing that would make me want to spend twice as much. The good: - Nice overall look and material quality. Looks excellent installed. - The unit itself is easy to install. - Buttons operate well. LED indicator on the front is nice. - Lights work well and can be rotated to focus on the cooking surface. - good fan suction even at low speed. - Well packaged. The finished surfaces are covered with a cling plastic to protect them from damage. This is nice on the primary unit, more annoying to peal off of the baffles. Things to be aware of: - The baffles fit very loosely into the housing and sit a little lop-sided. I'm sure this can be rectified with a little creativity. - A little louder than I expected, but still ok for having a conversation at the low speed without having to speak up. - The unit tended to vibrate when hanging on two bolts. I had to put a couple additional screws through the back corners to hold it firmly against the wall to address that. - Don't bother with the included wall screws and anchors, or the plastic duct.

{"review": "We could not be more pleased with how quickly the hood arrived and how well packaged it was. We are in the middle of kitchen remodeling and we had to wait a while until the cabinets were in place in order to install it. I won't talk about the process of installation because everyone has different needs, for instance, venting issues, re-routing of air pipes, holes in ceiling or wall, etc. The Hood looks amazing but the most important thing is that it works as intended. It does. The picture shown on the description is not the same one we got. Ours is all stainless steel with steel baffles. 760 CFM's. We were able to install it at 32\" from the top of the high power gas stove and it works beautifully without getting in the way. (for those with high BTU gas stoves, do the research for your stove since high BTUs and high CFMs may need extra distance) We specially enjoy the fact that the hood can be set up to shut itself off after 3 minutes. It is a bit loud, but not as loud as the piece of junk it replaced with less than 300 CFMs. We have kitchen/family room combo and there is enough noise with TV and kids to make no difference. The main thing is that it contains cooking odors and there is no grease on the side cabinets. After cooking a dish with cabbage as one of the ingredients, we could all tell how much better this hood was than the one we had before. It did not smell in the bedrooms or hallway. In short, we love the hood. It looks great. The stainless steel is beautifully polished and is eye candy as well as a great performer. One thing to remind myself of and leaving it here for those who will find it useful: When cleaning the baffles, remember to remove and wash the capture plastic container. Okay, how is the service with this company? If you have to deal with anyone there, you may be pleasantly surprised with the fact that your call is not routed out of the country. My contact person was Laureen in Ohio and she could not have been more friendly and professional. The fast responses received from Laureen is reminiscent of times gone by. If you are old enough, you will remember when customer service, professionalism, courtesy, and problem solving, were the golden standard upon which businesses were built. This is most definitely the case here. Our reason for the contacts is the fact that our ceilings are 10' feet tall. If that is the case for you, ensure that you order the right extensions to fit your needs at the time of placing the order. We could not be more pleased with the product or the company. We highly recommend them. In response to someone complaining about the screws: We used our own to install the hood based on the location of our studs and size of holes that had to be drilled. It is not a big problem or a reason to downgrade the quality of the product. (As soon as I know how to insert a picture of the installed hood, I will)", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "4 count them, 4--button levels of air suction! Stainless Steel is not cheap but high grade & heavy thickness. My hood arrived in pristine condition & best packing I have EVER seen, so was well-pleased. My 30\" version of this unit has 3 removable Stainless Baffle sections which was FREE upgrade from aluminum screening, and the buttons are on the vertical front ledge of unit with a DIGITAL readout screen of the level of chosen suction and even has time-delay on shut-off = BONUS! -Has a 3-prong plug to plug in and check if working the moment it arrived. -The exit of the 6\" round flu from motor has a butterfly damper that opens when fan engaged so will be great to prevent back flow from exterior. -The two piece chimney surrounds are also heavy duty Stainless Steel and uppermost section has two sides consisting of a series of venting to dispel heat at top sides. -The entire hood and two sections are protected by a clear or blue skin of plastic that is easily removed after installation. -There is an included small approximately 2\"X3\" clear plastic topless box that has slots that slide into brackets under motor housing that is supposed to catch any accumulating grease from motor area low point that is accessed via the removable baffle. This then can be emptied and wiped clean with ease. -Installation is easily done & straightforward...find the centerpoint of stovetop/range and have center of hood match this point and mark two hanger holes at level into studs with provided heavy gauge screws (rip open wall & install stud if not there--molly screws are NOT going to work here--after all won't be seen anyway as hood covers it). Con: -Two halogen lights are in rear of unit and are only 20 Watt each so total 40Watt so woefully dim for cooking surface...I have upper cabinets on both sides so I am installing under cabinet lights on both sides to compensate. I have not permanently installed totally on wall yet as am doing some extension of wiring in wall behind hood in wall but will update when totally complete with photos. I am using the two baffles on interior two exits of blower motor but I am doing a hollow faux wood beam to cover the metal 6\" flu system across the room to vent through out through bump-out dinette roof.

{"review": "5 stars for the initial review. Longevity is important for appliances...so we'll see how she does over the next months/years. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this hood. For $300, it is what it is. It's eye-candy. Looks incredible and makes a huge statement. But everything else about it is just kind of \"chincy.\" Not disappointed, as you have to expect that at this price point. The buttons don't push down very easily/evenly, the wires are dangling loose in the inner fan (some of their 3M tape came loose), some of the baffles fit loosely thus creating a lopsided effect (a gentle bending corrected the situation) the supplied screws/anchors are a joke. But hey, it looks incredible, and it does it's job...suck's the hot air. And for that, I'm stoked to spend only $300 on this! I've posted pictures for you to see....again, it looks awesome. The packaging job was incredible. And it comes coated with a protective film that protects the stainless finish until the final reveal. It is a little hard to peel off the film on the chimney extension unit. The other reviews said it scratches very easily...so I installed the chimney unit first, then peeled off the coating. I had to use a razor blade to score it just below the sight-line on one of the chimney extensions for a \"clean break.\" Was a little nervous removing it from the box because some of the protective film had its own scratches. I was worried those would transfer to the stainless steel. Thankfully, they did not. The noise is a non-issue. It's a fan people...it's going to make noise. On the highest setting, you need to raise your voice if you're standing directly by the hood trying to have a conversation. But the other settings did not require my wife and I to \"raise our voices.\" It's fine. Yes, all of the other reviewers are correct: buy new ductwork. The supplied plastic ductwork is a joke. It really is \"easy\" to install in that all you have to do is hang the thing. Everything else is literally plug and play! One more thought. We have a 30\" stove and I naturally was going to buy the 30\" hood. But right before my purchase, I started doing a little more research and many suggested to purchase a hood larger than your stove, to ensure it covers all of your burners. So at the last second, I opted for the 36\" hood. SOOOOO glad I did. Not only does it look better on the wall, it efficiently \"sucks\" regardless of what is cooking on any of the 4 burners. Buy it. It's worth it. Let's just see how long it lasts......I'm cautiously optimistic. UPDATE 4/25/2013: After only our second time cleaning the stainless steel baffle filters, the screw/nut that holds the baffle together stripped, thus rendering it useless. Obviously, we were pretty disappointed. I sent an email to customer service asking what the next step of action should be. They responded that same day with a tracking number and I had a new baffle in 2 days with no cost. I've never experienced customer service like that. Really, just outstanding. I'm still worried that issues like this may arise again, but for the price-point, I have to expect that (one of the same screws on another baffle sits crooked in the baffle, causing it to align poorly). My wife and I still love this hood...and after this customer service interaction, we're only more pleased with the purchase!", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "I just replaced a \"Euro Kitchens\" brand hood with this one. The Euro is a similar product, inexpensive import. The switch panel started falling apart after a year, lighting transformer blew out twice, etc. No replacement parts available - so avoid that brand. This unit, on the other hand, seems a bit nicer - it's much quieter (yes, you can chat with your spouse while cooking, even on high speed). It attached easily to the existing duct work. Only 2 screws hold it to the wall, and I would definitely worry about using the drywall anchors they supply - I'd think you really want some wood backing behind the drywall (and this thing's big enough that you could likely cut & patch some in, keeping the mess behind the unit and invisible). It comes with wiring and parts diagrams and a plastic flex tube (I believe code calls for metal in many areas, but metal flex is cheap). It has similar soft-touch buttons to many other hoods and that would be my biggest worry, that those could fail on me again - but the three year warranty is nice. They answered emails within 24 hours - and it got here in TWO DAYS for free - not bad! CONS: this uses \"baffle\" style filters vs. the woven stainless you usually find in these things - so I'll be keeping an eye on internal grease buildup.

The unit does vibrate a little bit, no one notices but me, I tend to be over critical. I have the hood secured to studs so I was able to get a snug fit.

{"review": "We are remodeling our kitchen and wanted to buy a simple hood fan to go above the range. Prices in local stores were extremely high, so I looked on Amazon. Sure enough, we found this hood fan, reasonably priced and just what we were looking for. It looks great in our kitchen and although it obviously doesn't vent as well as an outside venting fan would do, it does what it is designed to do very well. It is also a very slim model, which gives the wall area behind your range more real estate to hang utensils, etc. On the con side, we have a 12\" tall cabinet above our range. Because this hood fan is much slimmer than previous hood fans we have had, it sits pretty high on the wall. The light bulb hangs down to the same level as the bottom of the hood fan. So if the hood fan is set higher than your line of vision (which I think it would be even with a taller 15\" cabinet), the light can be a bit blinding when it is on. It would be better if the light bulb had been more recessed within the fan. On the plus side, it illuminates the range very well. The light bulb is a minor annoyance, but otherwise we like the look and quality of this fan.", "id": "3741441"}

The light and fan controls are functional, but basic (light on or off; fan low, high, or off). The only real consideration is if your range hood will be positioned where you will be able to see it from below. The underside of the hood is pretty ugly looking as I attempted to show in the picture I uploaded. For us this wasn't a problem as we don't see it unless we try to. If you have an open plan kitchen and the underside of the hood will be visible from the dining table or lounge then you may want something that is a little more pleasing to look at.

However, keep in mind that as a functional fan it is nearly useless. It's loud and barely functions as a fan. I use it for light more than anything but it does sort of work to capture cooking smells. I just wanted something cheap to look nice and fill the space and give me light. If you're looking for a really good hoodfan this aint it. But if you just want something to fill that space and function well enough then you'll be happy.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "This range hood passed my expectations in both opperation and appearance. (We had reviewed this product on line and saw the one drawback was some \"noise\" associated with the operation of the fan.) We mounted it on the wall (primarily) and on the side of our cabinet. It went up solidly - which was my main concern. To my surprise, the fan is much quieter than expected. The Stainless steel looks much more expensive than it actually was. Mounted according to directions puts the not so attractive off-set light (and cover) out of sight. I highly recommended this.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "The stainless steel looks great with my stainless steel range, and the installation went smoothly. No surprises. Was able to install in 1 hour with little knowledge of range hoods.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "It works as any hood in this price range should - and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's quiet, has separate switches for the light and fan and looks like it costs more than it does. I used it in a rental apartment I own and it fit perfectly with the stainless stove. My tenants are happy and I'm happy as a result. It's easily installed. In my case I hung it from the bottom of the cabinet above. It's not too heavy but it's easiest as a 2 person job.", "id": "3741441"}

We moved into a new house and the existing hood was white, when the previous owner had installed new stainless appliances in the rest of the kitchen.

Took 20 minutes to take out the old one and put this in and it has been perfect so far.", "id": "3741441"}

{"review": "Range hoods are so expensive. I was in sticker shock looking for a replacement to the one I had at the time. That is, until I found this one on Amazon. I couldn't believe its price. I ordered and got it. Mind you, it is an economy model. The fan is a bit loud. The edges are not exactly square, i.e., I can see a little gap between the hood and the cabinet to its left with the gap bigger at the bottom than the top. But, it works as advertised. The light works. The fan is strong. And, it looks good. People really don't notice the gap that I mentioned.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "I never had a stove without a range hood, but when I moved in my new house (which is actually a very old house) there were only cabinets above the stove. No hood at all. I really missed the light the most! Venting would have been very difficult as the house is made of stones, and the walls inside are concrete blocks with metal mesh holding plaster. Not a simple drywall type installation at all. So I decided a ventless hood was the best and easiest option for me. I worried that it wouldn't be effective, but it does a surprisingly good job at moving air. A little noisy, but most hoods I have ever owned were slightly noisy. There is a clip-on cover for the front little vents if you indeed have a vented option. I did not know that hood was not shipped with the extra filter needed for ventless operation. There is a mesh cover for the fan, but it is not a filter. Further, the item amazon featured on the hood product page was NOT the one that went with this. I went to the Braun website and still was confused. I finally found the right one: it is this one: Broan #41F Range Hood Filter. There may be non-Broan brand filters available, but I wanted to be sure I got the right one, so I went with the name brand the first time. This filter is installed with the blue side next to the blade and then put the included mesh screen over that. There is a clip that holds them in place. The hood does require hard wiring. I did not have that either!! (Why are these projects always so complicated?!!!) However, there is an item available (and noted on the Broan website) called BR-HCK44 - Range Hood Power Cord Kit. It is \"for use when hard wiring is not an option and a plug is needed.\" There is also a wall mounting bracket (BR-35) for installations where there is no upper cabinetry. I didn't need the bracket as I had upper cabinetry. I don't think either are available here on amazon, but just google the model number/name and you will find one. They are relatively inexpensive. I actually had to run my new plug cord down the wall and use the outlet behind the gas stove. If you have a similar problem, here is my solution, maybe it could work for you, too. I was putting in a glass tile backsplash behind the stove anyway, and wanted wood or ceramic border to \"frame\" the small tiles. I figured I could use the recess of one of the trim pieces to hide the cord as it ran down the wall and then simply plug it into my grounded outlet behind my gas stove. (Most gas stoves need an outlet behind them for clocks, electric ignition, timers, oven light, etc.) I couldn't find any ceramic that worked, but instead routed out some trim molding with a dremel, tucked the cord behind that channel, and used the wood to frame my tile backsplash. The wood should be safe, it is no closer than any adjacent cabinetry would be. You can't tell there is a cord there, and it is pretty protected from bumps since it is behind the molding. (I just used little finish nails in case I need access to it in the future. I put them in the wood first so I wouldn't nick the cord.) I did need a short grounded extension, too...the add-on cord was only 3 feet long, but the ugly stuff is behind the stove. It was a tricky problem, and some of you may already have wiring in place, but just in case you run into something like I did, I thought I would post my work-around! Maybe I will post a picture of it one of these days! One more tip...if you have to install this by yourself (like I did) it is HARD holding the thing up with one hand (and your head!) and marking the holes for drill/screws with the other! SAVE your packing box, put it on your stove and put the hood on top. It will hold your hood very close to its final position for you so you can make the marks for the screws! I think I added another little amazon box so it sat high enough. OR use the cardboard from the box to make a template for where the drill holes need to be (it is easier to hold cardboard than a range hood!)", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "For the money, i guess it is unfair to expect a whisper quit unit, so you get what you pay for with this. I was replacing a very old Broan hood, so i got this mainly because i had hopes that it would fit the space i had with minimal fuss and this did hold true and thereby accomplished my primary goal. I was a bit amazed that being 30 years newer, the filter arrangement was so flimsy compared to the one i was replacing. I'll just have to live with that. This unit is also noticeably noisier than the original as well. One thing that also surprised me was that if you vent the unit out through the wall, there is a vent in the front that must be covered up with a cheesy looking black plastic cover. I didn't notice it in the pictures on the amazon web site, but it is very noticeable in my kitchen. This is the result of having chosen a 'convertible' unit. I could not discern what the term actually meant and assumed it meant venting through the back or the top. In the end, i think it means you can use it vented through the wall or just recycle the air indoors. My experience is a reminder that buying this type of product online is fraught with decisions that are costly to recover from, if made without understanding exactly what is being selected. This is made all the more difficult because Broan offers many, many units to pick from and their description of what makes the units unique are amazingly vague and difficult to understand, even after going to their web site and downloading the instructions beforehand. Additionally, i found it impossible to find any local stores who carry these in stock, so it is impossible to do that type of legwork first. In the end, it might be unfair to give only two stars for this product, since you basically are getting about the cheapest hood you can buy, so the rating really reflects the frustration of not being presented with enough intelligible information that i might have been able to pick a unit that more closely matches what i was attempting to get.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "Our builder-grade (G.E. brand) hood bit the dust so we bought this one. Fully expected I'd have to hire an electrician, so we \"uninstalled\" our other unit to save time (because electricians charge by the hour). When we got it out (four screws!) we looked at it and figured out that we could re-use the other unit's electrical plug on this unit (we have an electrical outlet in the cabinet above our hood) so we did. It took my husband and I about 30 minutes to install (one holding the unit, while the other one puts in the screws). It is versatile, too, because you could use it on just about any kind of vent (round or rectangular) and it fits beautifully. It is SOOO much quieter than our other one, and you can actually feel the air rushing past your hand when you turn it on(our other hood was never that efficient!) Checking online for other prices, the cheapest I could find was about $150 or thereabouts, so imagine my surprise when this one arrived in perfect condition, and was so easy to install! Awesome!

{"review": "After having two DOA units from another manufacturer, I turned to this (white, 30 inch) Broan model. The unit arrived quickly and in perfect shape. I was replacing and old (yucky) unit that was using the rectangular duct to the outside. Installation was pretty easy. It probably took me about 1 1/2 hours from start to finish with removing the old one, putting this one up, and clean up. The unit is pretty loud but I knew that (by looking at the manufacturer spec sheet) before buying. It's probably not any louder than the one I replaced though. As others have commented, the plate that covers the vent grill is a little cheesy. If you are ducting this unit (which I was), you will need to use this cover to block the vent grill that would be used in a non-ducting scenario. It clips on pretty well, if you try hard enough, but it doesn't completely seal and I can feel a little air escaping out when the unit is on. Not a huge deal as 98% of the air is going out the duct as intended. Regardless of what the manufacturer cut sheet says, this unit is not 30 inches wide. It is about 29 3/8 inches, which allows it to fit inside a standard 30 inch cabinet opening. So, maybe just a little semantics but the manufacturer should probably be a little clearer on this since it was confusing to me. Originally I didn't think I was going to be able to use this as it was going to be slightly too big for my opening. However, after scouring the Broan site, I found an FAQ that in fact said the units are slightly less wide than indicated so they can fit within the specified opening. Makes sense to me now but, again, a little confusing at first. Overall this was a great buy and a solid unit. I couldn't find any ducted options in my local homestores without spending two to three times the cost of this unit.", "id": "3741441"}

{"review": "Last summer (in CO) in the place I rented there was no ac and no basement to escape the blistering heat. It got so hot that the thermostat was reading 90+ inside! I was really afraid for my dogs. This year I bought the Luma Comfort 1650 before the hot temps started and when it arrived I was a little shocked at how big it is. My next thought was: how was I going to get it in the house (I'm not a big person). It was a bit of a struggle, but I finally got it in and once I got it set up and filled with water (this was all VERY easy to do) and turned it on. I was a bit skeptical (ok, ALOT skeptical) as to whether this thing was really going to keep the house cool, but it really does! going through these heat waves when it's 95-100 outside, it can keep it around 77 inside. Not chilly, very liveable. If you sit right in front of the thing you will get cold, though. You do have to monitor the water level and not allow it to get to the min point. I usually re-fill around the halfway point, but I can be gone for 6 hours and come home and the house is nice and cool, the dogs are comfortable and the water level is just slightly below the mid point. Another nice side effect is that it adds moisture to the house. One thing to note is that it will keep my DOWNstairs cool, but since cool air doesn't rise, it does nothing for the UPstairs. I ordered a smaller unit to have in the bedroom. All in all, I think this is a great product (wish it were made in America instead of China).", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "For all those complaining the unit does not cool, here some evaporative cooler basics: 1.) Evaporative coolers only work in dry climates, if you live in Florida or NY get an A/C unit 2.) You MUST open your windows by a few inches: one window located BEHIND this cooler so the unit's fan can draw in dry air from the outside. One window on the opposite side of the room, so the fan can blow out the warm moist air. The moisture coming out of the cooler absorbs the heat in the room air and in the process the overall temperature in the room is reduced. If you don't follow this you will end up with a room that is not only hot, but also humid like a tropical jungle. The instructions that come with the cooler clearly spell this out but then some people never RTFM. Filling the unit with water is messy or takes a lot of patience if you try to do it via the small inlet at the back, unless you are close to a hose bib and can use a garden hose or you hook up the unit permanently via the provided hose hook-up, but that kind of defeats the concept of a PORTABLE cooler. If you permanently hook up the unit you might as well get a stationary unit with way better performance and less noise. What works for me to fill the unit with water is that I unscrewed the back panel. This allows me to fill the unit with a bucket and also to throw in big ice blocks if desired. after filling I just re-seat the back panel without screws, it stays in place just fine. Pros: - large water tank - large back panel and side panels provide enough surface for the unit to sufficiently cool - hose hookup Cons: - too noisy, fan has 2 speed settings on high speed it sounds like a prop plane taking off. even low speed is too loud for my taste. You definitely do not want to listen to music or watch TV with this unit on and in the same room -the wheels don't roll well when unit is filled with water - the water/ice inlet is way too small - too expensive for the design/built quality and the features offered. - no remote control or timer control - no low water shutoff Bottom line: I would not necessarily recommend this unit, while it cools consider putting in a exterior/stationary unit. You will have better performance and less noise. This is what I ended up doing.", "id": "3737671"}

{"review": "I recently purchased the Luna Comfort EC220W unit. I purchased this unit mostly to put humidity in the air. It cools very well also. Six years ago we moved from the humid sea air S.F. Bay Area to the low, dry desert of Arizona. Outdoor summer time temperatures can get to 115 degrees & higher. We run an air conditioner continually in the summer and our humidity in the house is only around 5% to 10%. An air conditioner drys out the air alot. I haven't been able to sleep a complete night because my skin is sensitive and dry to begin with the lack of humidity gives it a prickly, burning sensation. I've used all sorts of lotions & creams and they only make my flesh feel like I have meat tenderizer on. The dryness also made my dogs itchy, caused my furniture to crack and my house plants have suffered. We all have to drink a lot of water so we won't dehydrate. When I received this unit, filled it, plugged it in, opened a window, turned off my AC and in about two hours or so my humidity gauge on the wall registered 45% humidity! I had actually thought the gauge was broken before this, it has never registered a temp over 10%! I will run this unit mostly, at night. For the first time in six summers I actually slept comfortable and woke up rested. My skin feels soft, my dogs stopped itching and I think my plants are happier too. The only drawback is that the fan is loud. But I can learn to live with that. Some moisture in the air is important for good health.

{"review": "I called AirKing customer service and they confirmed that there is no spring in this vent. It seems well made with heavy gauge metal, but I could see a problem with wind making that noise like other reviewers mentioned. I guess you can put some foam weatherstripping or equivalent to stop the noise if you experience any. I also ordered the Broan-Nutone 641. I will edit this review once I get it to compare the two. Maybe my rating is unfair because I don't think the description mentioned that it was spring loaded, and maybe the designers felt that the spring would be problematic over time. So if you only want a gravity damper, then you won't go wrong with this product. EDIT 8/25/11: I just got the Broan 641 (for 6\" round duct) wall cap. Now this is a thing of beauty. Full weatherstripping around entire damper for no noise and a gentle spring to keep damper closed. Might be a touch lighter guage metal than the Airking, but I'm going to go with the Broan. The bird cage is an added plus. Well made.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "I ordered this wall cap because it's hard to find 6\" wall caps in the hardware stores. The first one I ordered was missing a spring or \"spring wire\" to help keep the damper closed. Most wall caps have a stiff wire that goes from the damper to the hood to act like a spring to keep the damper closed when not in use. Otherwise it will hang open letting bugs and critters in. These in particular stay slightly ajar due to their \"hinging mechanism\". Also whenever the wind blows it will just slap around make a noticeable sound since it's metal. The damper has a hole in the center which I assume was meant for the spring, unless it's a tooling hole. So I sent this one back and got another one, and sure enough the one I got was missing the spring as well. So I contacted Air King directly and talked to their parts department to make sure it was supposed to have something to keep the damper closed when not in use. They talked to their engineering department and according to them ALL wall caps are supposed to have springs to keep them closed. Regardless my second one is going back as well. These are pretty nice caps made out of metal, it's a shame they seem to have a manufacturing quality issue. If their engineering department was wrong and these weren't supposed to have a spring mechanism then I would stay away from it because there is nothing to keep the damper closed when not in use.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "The wall vent is easy to install and allows great air flow. It is connected to a new Samsung Microwave and provides much more airflow than a powerful hair dryer. It is hard to find these 6 inch vents now that home construction has slowed. None of the majors or local hardware stores carry this type anymore. The flap closes when the vent fan is off and keeps out flying insects. One minor issue with this type of vent is a minor rattle when a strong wind blows the auto closing flap. A strong spring could prevent that rattle but would reduce air flow.", "id": "3741441"}

It was easy to install and looks much better than what was there originally. I have heard the cover open and close with the wind a couple times - but only when wind gusts get up around 70 MPH (and I can't really fault it for that). Other than that, it works perfectly. I have a 1,200 CFM blower connected to this with a 16 foot vent run that reduces from 10\" to 8\" then to 6\" along the way (which is the maximum reduction allowed by the blower specs). I haven't had any trouble with this wall cap - it opens whenever the blower is on and closes when the blower turns off. I recommend this wall cap - it's a good price for a 6\" cap and it looks nice and has a low profile.", "id": "3741441"}

{"review": "We upgraded to stainless appliances and didn't want to deal with a microwave-hood, so started searching Amazon for the hood. I don't understand all the review chatter about how quiet the motors are on hoods... IT'S A VENT HOOD, PEOPLE! If it's not making noise, you're probably setting off your fire alarms. That said, this unit makes the appropriate amount of noise when its running, and we haven't set off the alarm while cooking since I installed it. My installation vents into the wall behind the hood, and the instructions were clear enough for me to hook up to the old opening with no issues. Our previous builder-grade almond hood was installed makeshift, with screws angled in the corners of the housing into the cabinets with nothing holding it to the underside of the cabinets above. The instructions show you how to shim under the cabinets if there is a recess underneath them, so you can attach it securely. I agree with other reviewers and recommend installing the two halogen bulbs before you hang the unit under your cabinets. This one is a winner!", "id": "3741441"}

{"review": "Purchased from Amazon, the QML30SS was delivered by Fedx from Houston TX in a plain brown box which was poorly taped. Fortunately, there was another box inside that one and it was the factory Broan box which was sealed and new. I was a little surprised that even inside the Broan box there was very little styrofoam around the hood. Anyway, no dents, dings or dimples so all was good. The unit was very light weight considering its appearance. The metal is thin and I dare say flimsy until it is installed where then the mounting to the underside of a cabinet give it rigidity. I should add that because of the bottom of the hood being closed as opposed to many other hoods on the market, that closed bottom gives the hood additional rigidity and strength. Installation was a project for sure. I had to replace the shims under the cabinet to accept the hood mounting screws. Making new shims added at least a hour to my installation. I use the hood in the non-ducted mode so I didn't have to route duct work or cut holes. When installing, I found it easier to hold the hood up to where I want to mount it and mark the holes for the mounting screws rather than to do all the measuring necessary to find their location. By doing this, I had a very perfect fit (requires someone to hold it while another marks the screw holes). I purchased a Broan carbon filter (required for non-ducted installation) and two Broan light bulbs. The light bulb sockets are attached to the underside of the hood so that when you unscrew the hood bottom, you can lay that bottom on a table and install the lights using the adjustable brackets so that the bulbs are perfectly flush with the bottom of the hood before you reattach it. Knowing now that the light sockets are adjustable, I wish I had purchased the cheaper, non-Broan, light bulbs at half the price. Not all bulbs are the same length so I took no chances and bought the over priced Broan bulbs, regretfully. The hood is 29 7/8\" by 17 1/2\". The fan is plastic and the fan motor isn't too loud as others have said. The fan isn't anything more or less than I expected for a hood of this caliber. The low speed might be adequate to take care of a simmering smoke and the fast speed would be adequate to handle larger plumes. If you are looking for a hood that will suck the pancakes off your griddle, then move on, this hood isn't for you. But, this was perfect for me in that it was styled very much like the expensive Bosh models, does the job of any hood in its class and I absolutely love the fact that you can wipe clean the underside so no grease ever builds up. The lights are placed very well on the hood and illuminates the stove top evenly. The light \"high\" setting is bright white (daylight color) and the \"low\" light level is more of a antique white or yellow light in contrast. It is a great night light in the kitchen that doesn't blind you and adds a bit of warmth to the room. I didn't want to invest in something that was more expensive than my stove and I didn't want to stuff a $40 dollar hood into my kitchen either. This was the best compromise. Expensive looks and does the job at half the price. Can't beat that.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "I ordered the hood along with the extra package that includes a halogen bulb and a filter, however the hood uses TWO bulbs so you then have to go and buy a second bulb. Don't understand why they didn't include two bulbs.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "Purchased this at a local home improvement store because we were desperate to find a range hood quickly. I would have preferred to find a unit with LED lights, but since this doesn't even come with the halogen bulbs it calls for I figured it was worth a shot to substitute some LED of the same size. There is a slight adjustability to the bulb housing so the the LED didn't protrude. It works well on the higher power light setting, but flickers annoyingly on the lower power light setting - I think if I had purchased a dimmable LED bulb it would not do that. I am content to leave it on high. The fan isn't too loud or too powerful but it is a vast improvement over no hood at all. This is a very nice looking hood - I am pleased with the aesthetics. My only complaint would be the astonishing variety of screws that hold it together - why can't they all be the same? In addition to a phillips head screwdriver you will want a 1/4\" hex driver to mount this easily. The screws provided to mount this to the cabinet were not long enough so I had to use something else (I could have also shimmed the space).", "id": "3741441"}

{"review": "Here's where I'm at now ... I just did a test mount on the wall for positioning. Some initial thoughts - its a nice looking unit. Appears to be fairly well made, pretty solid, and simple construction. So far I like it. Instructions are a joke, and I haven't entirely figured out what the included hardware is for. I mounted this with toggle bolts - which did not hit any studs, but I had a stud that was nearby so was able to pretty simply drill a hole thru the mounting portion of the unit and add a third point to secure it confidently into a stud. Interesting that the instructions specifically say to only use this with metal ducts no plastic - though included in the box was a plastic duct pipe. I'm not sure why they even included it and frankly its kinda dangerous to include it because plenty of people will assume it is safe to use. I didnt expect it to include ducting that I'd need - but I dont know why they included ducting you cant/shouldnt use. I plugged in the unit and turned on the fan - and wow. This thing can move alot of air. Sound level is appropriate, not whisper quiet, but acceptable. I feel very confident that this unit will provide more than adequate exhaust. The absolute best thing so far about this unit is the buttons. I was very very surprised to find that they used touch sensitive buttons. My brand new $1000 range doesnt have these types of buttons. Not sure how to describe it, but its not what you'd think - its not the typical squishy button behind a plastic panel. Its essentially touch sensitive - you can gently place your finger on the 'button' and it turns on. I'm very happy with this feature, it feels high-end, frankly I'm a little pissed that my other new kitchen appliances dont have the same. If you already have a duct to the outside, installation will be less than an hour. The manual says to have 2 or 3 people to help, I did it on my own. A good tip is to take cardboard (some perfectly sized ones in the shipping box), trace and outline as well as the mounting holes. Then you can hold this up on your wall, level it, and drill your holes and mount your toggle bolts. The installation instructions are pretty terrible, I actually went to homedepot website and just downloaded the instructions for a similar looking product (completely different brand) and was able to find more intelligible instructions and tips on installation. I intend to update this review as I've gotten some use out of this unit. ---Update, a couple months later---- Still very happy with the unit. I haven't quite figured out the gas sensor function, not sure if its a safety function or a functionality thing.... but it wasnt important to me anyhow. Units works well, its not whisper quiet - but does a really great job exhuasting fumes and heat. My old hood was fairly useless, this one I switch on almost everytime I cook or bake - just to get the extra heat out of the kitchen (it's summertime now). By looking at the breeze that comes out of the vent outside, this thing moves quite a bit of air. I really love the touch sensitive controls - did I mention that already? I had a party recently and got a couple of compliments on the hood specifically. One additional note on installation - though I said I did it on my own - it really would be good to have a second set of hands to install this. No fault in the manufacturing or quality of the product, but I actually bent/ripped the steel a bit - it was on the seam of a back corner, pretty much impossible to see in the spot mine is in - but this was caused by me balancing this thing and having it half supported and letting it twist on itself. Its not flimsy at all, so dont let this comment deter your purchase - just reiterates that a second hand will be helpful in the install.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "Well, product was very easy to install, quiet, and pretty much everything described in the description. My wife loves this range. She thought buying this range was the best thing ever happened to us this year so far. The gas sensor becomes extremely convenient while you cook. Turns on about 5 seconds after you cook something, and turns off about 1 min after you are done. One thing about the auto function is that once the auto function is on, there's no way to control it manually unless you turn off the auto function first. Pretty decent product. I would say it's the right product at right price.", "id": "3741441"}
{"review": "This is a great hood, but it does have a flaw It wouldn't operate properly. We called the manufacturer, who explained that the problem was a defective gas sensor. He explained how to remove it; the hood has been perfect since then. Sensor removal is very easy. There is no improved gas sensor. We didn't realize that it had a gas sensor, so we're not disappointed, but if a gas sensor is important to you, you won't want this model. The hood was easily installed by the contractor who renovated our kitchen. I saw him do it. I certainly wouldn't try it myself, but it's not brain surgery. The built in lighting is excellent, and this thing will exhaust anything that comes off your stove top. The controls are very convenient. The filter screens are very easy to remove for cleaning. Personally, I don't see the point of a remote control on a range hood. When you use it, you're working at the stove top. I'd buy this one again.", "id": "3741441"}

Very easy installation, takes you about 20 minutes to put it up! Sounds not too quiet neither too loud, but it really did it's job, very powerful fans on this hood.

{"review": "This hood vent appears to work properly, is fairly quiet and looks great in my newly remodeled kitchen, but the installation hardware included was completely ineffective. First attempt at using the drywall screws provided was a complete fail - they wouldn't tighten at all and we ended up getting our own drywall screws from the local home depot. Once we did that, the rest of the installation was fairly easy. Only other negative was that we had hoped we could wire this vent in directly, and according to other reviews/questions answered we were under the impression we could. Not the case once we pulled it out of the box -- this only comes with a plug, and no instructions on how to directly wire it in, so we had to install an electrical outlet. But, for the price and how nice it looks and works so far now that the installation is done, seems like a great deal and addition to our kitchen.

This does not happen constantly, only on certain wind conditions. It does not have a digital time clock, even though it looks like it does by the controls.

If you have a electric range you will need to contact Amazon (which responded right away) or the Company Golden Vantage explaining that your unit seems to have a mind of its own, and they will send through email the two simple things that will make the unit work perfectly. The instructions will show you how to (1) remove the gas sensor, and (2) remove the white cable from the circuit board, two simple very easy steps to a pretty awesome beautiful stainless steel hood. (FYI) the instructions tell you to remove the unit from the wall to make the two step adjustment.

{"review": "My cabinet maker found it to be a bit bulky for the size and depth of our cabinets. Which are standard depth and go all the way to the ceiling.

I preferred not quite as obvious an incline and did not want a \"chimney look\". This way it has a more subtle, seamless appearance. So he installed the vent or power pack without the liner.

{"review": "I live in a studio apartment where a 10,000-BTU a/c handles most of the cooling. Unfortunately, the cold air doesn't quite reach the bathroom, around a corner through an alcove. So for many years I have had a Slant/Fin Personal Zone Air Cooler perched on the window sill in there (it's a pre-war building with windows in the bathrooms), pointed down at me when I'm, uh, reading... The S/F finally conked -- the motor gave out, and water leaked through the water level indicator window -- so I was looking for a compact air cooler to fit in the bathroom. S/F no longer makes air coolers, apparently. Enter this unusual tower, which looks rather like one might expect Dr. Who's nemesis, a Dalek, to look like if the cyborg slimmed down and became a fashion model... Like a Dalek, this tower rolls around on casters, but it lacks a plunger or exterminator ray! Goodness, but this Dalek blows a gust of cool air! If you used this just as a tower fan, it seems to blow more air at the highest of three fan speed settings than any tower fan I've ever encountered -- strong enough to make a plastic bottle of dental solution wobble on the bathtub rim three or four feet away! But things get even cooler when you push the Cool button, activating a water pump that moistens a sponge-like wick through which air blows inside the tower. You add water to the reservoir that slides back from the base of the tower; the tower also comes with two ice packs you can chill in your freezer and slide into compartments in the water reservoir, yielding extra cool air for up to four hours, according to the instructions. Other functions include a timer for automatic shut-off, side-to-side oscillation, a sleep mode that throttles down as the night air cools off while you sleep, and a \"natural\" mode, which randomly changes fan speed to simulate real breezes. I am impressed by the manufacturer's attention to detail here. When you push a button, for example, the control lights get brighter, then dim after a few minutes. The tower also comes with a handy remote, duplicating all functions on the top switch panel. And the tower includes a washable air filter to keep the wick from getting gunked up by dust in the air. One thing I'm not sure about is whether I will need to add some bleach to the water to prevent the fetid smells most coolers and humidifiers give off over time. The instructions don't address this issue. I can't imagine that the wick is treated with a germ-retardant that will continue to work after weeks and months. In the meantime, however, this tower of power is sure keeping my bathroom cool and comfortable! The tower would probably work in any setting where you are within a five- or six-foot radius. I should mention as well that the fan is quiet, even at the highest setting. I will report back if I encounter any problems. Until then, I am impressed by the amount of cooling this tower provides, running on less energy than an incandescent light bulb consumes... UPDATE: I was dismayed to see how many other Amazon customers have had problems with this cooler since the time I wrote my review. My Luma continues to work perfectly. So I guess buying one of these is not the slam-dunk I thought it was originally. Still, the need exists for an air cooler with a compact footprint, and this is one of only two such designs that I am currently aware of (O2 Cool has just introduced a Dual-Fan Tower with a Mister on one of the fans -- I have ordered one and will review that unit as well). Caveat emptor! UPDATE NUMBER TWO: I did finally start noticing a fetid smell when the machine is sitting idle. A few drops of scented bleach in the water solved the problem. I should probably also give the wick a soak in bleach. PROS: * Tower form uses minimal floor space. * Quiet in operation. * Powerful fan. * Swing mode disperses cool air. * Several operating modes. * Easy to maintain. * Freezer packs for extra cooling. * Remote control duplicates all functions. * Minimum energy consumption. * Casters enable easy re-positioning.

{"review": "I have a stainless steel gas range top, and this seemed like a nice solution to the daily chore of cleaning around the burners. My stove is slightly recessed, with curved interior corners, and is flat and open across the middle. The product is much as described, but not a good fit to my stove, and so it may not be a good fit to other than completely flat surfaced stoves. The openings for the burners are very small, presumably to ensure a fit for the smallest burners, however cutting them to fit is not as simple as implied by the rudimentary instructions, and getting a good fit is cautious process of trial and error even with good measurements. Once you get the openings cut, the next challenge is shape of the surface. My stove has a recessed surface and curved corners, which the liners did not adapt well to. I ended up slitting the corners about ½ inch toward the center, and then slightly rounding the remaining tips to allow overlap and still effectively cover the surface. It is hardly a perfect fit, but is workable, and the appearance is acceptable (not a complete eye-sore). Pros: Material is as described, closely matching our stainless steel stovetop, and is relatively non-stick. Cons: Difficult to get a nice fit around burners and cover the stovetop surface unless your stovetop is flat, corners are square, and burners are all very small and of equal size. In my opinion, the installation method and resulting appearance were what you would expect from cheap disposable liners. I gave this product 3 stars as a result of the quality of the material, but was leaning toward 2 stars based on the installation method and price.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "I have a gas stove with black ceramic flat surface. It supposed to be easy to clean, but in reality it is very far from it. I used different types of protectors with little success, and these liners is the best so far in terms of the protection and cleaning the stove after them. I didn't find a problem fitting them to the burners, and they really protect the surface very well (if it's flat). However, I agree with other review that it would not work with the non-flat surface stoves, because they work if they can cling to the surface. Of course, there are cons: First of all, they are not that easy to clean, and this is only because they are thin and flexible (which is a plus for them as protectors). To clean them properly, one needs to put them on some flat hard surface, keep them with one hand in place, and wash with soap or scrub with wet cleaning wipes. Not an easy task, though their surface itself is relatively easy to clean (as long as you fix it as I described) as any other non-stick surface. Dishwasher doesn't really work for their cleaning. The second flaw is actually the price. The liners are not everlasting, far from it. They get permanently dirty with time, get creases, etc. I guess their lifetime would be as a lifetime of about 2-3 changes of regular aluminum burner bibs, which is not long. And this makes them a bit too expensive. So, I would recommend this product to the owners of the flat-surface stoves with some reservations about its price.", "id": "3741411"}

{"review": "I was given this \"NEW and Improved griddle\" from Camp Chef to test out in the field here in Central Oregon where we cook outside over 300 nights a year. They have a new mold and design and now it will perform like all of the other Camp Chef products. (Camp Chef has the best customer service in the industry) This is one of my favorite griddles since it can be used on both sides! After reading some of the older reviews and hearing Camp Chef had redesigned the Griddle it was time to test the new product. We have been using this model now for about a month and they are super durable. PROS: Fits Multiple Camp Chef products from 1-4 burner units! New design is extremely durable Finish is completely pre seasoned and easy to keep \"Black\" Grease tray system is great for all types of cooking CONS Cast iron stays hot for a long time! Must take care of this griddle and use your cast iron conditioner Overall This a a great new design and will give you years of long use... Have some fun and keep cooking outdoors. Hope you like my review.... Chef Kurt", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "Like others before I also received a griddle that cracked the first time it was heated. I immediately called Camp Chef to tell them their product had a problem. They acknowledged they already were aware of the issue and appreciated my call. They said the issue was addressed and agreed to send me out at new one at no cost and assured it me it wouldn't break. I am pleased to say I have used the new on three times and it works wonderfully. It is nice to see a company who admit to it's problems and takes care of the customer.", "id": "3741411"}

They had me e-mail them pics of the crack and proof of purchase. Three days later I received an e-mail saying they are sending me a new one. I just hope the new one doesn't have the same issue but I bumped my rating up from 1 star to 3 for good customer service.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "An excellent add to any grill - not just for camp chef grills! The fit may not be perfect but the plate compensates for uneven heating of todays cheap grills and the flimsy grill racks on them.

You can also flip it over and cook bacon & eggs or pancakes on the backside on lazy weekend mornings.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "This is a great little griddle. For several years I have used it with the Camp-Chef triple burner stove about once a month when the girls get together and go horse camping. It's used for most every meal from hash browns, bacon, and pancakes to grilled cheese or hamburgers to fajitas, fish tacos or quesadillas. Everything always cooks perfect on this griddle! I have even used it as a warming tray by setting plates of food and the coffee pot on it as it disperses heat well when the stove is turned to the 'low' setting. And clean up is a snap. It's hefty, but not too heavy for me to easily lift about. Several other friends bought this after seeing mine, though they each had a drain hole drilled in the catch-channel along the side; that is way too messy for me. I think it is already optimally designed. Grease is easily soaked up with a paper towel and then properly disposed.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "I really do like my new camp chef griddle. It cooks great with nice even heat. Very heavy weight and you really can cook on it straight out of the box. Love the fact that it is pre-seasoned. Have been washing, hand drying then spraying just a very thin sheen of canola oil on it to store. Have cooked eggs, chicken, veggies, fajitas, and bancon. The bacon is where my on complaint comes in. The dripp tray area is just to small to hold the drippings for bacon. Just one full griddle of thick sliced bacon produces enough grease to fill the drip tray. The griddle gets way to hot to handle while cooking so pouring it off is not an option. I considered drilling a hole and hangging a drip cup under it but the frame of the stove is directly under the drip tray. Guess will have to cook bacon in a skillet. For this reason i give it four stars. Overall am pleased and would recommend this product.", "id": "3741411"}

{"review": "I purchased a two burner Camp Chef stove this last summer for camping and knew I needed a Griddle. I purchased this one after reading some reviews. The price was right and like how it is reversible. I used it about ten times this last summer and it worked great. It had enough surface space for me to cook for six people at a time, obviously this depends on what your cooking. When cooking bacon the grease/oil trap does fill but never over flowed. It got close several times but I just wadded up a paper towel, soaked some of the grease/oil up, and continued cooking. Over all I'm very happy with this purchase and would purchase another in a heart beat to make my two burner stove a full griddle.", "id": "3741411"}

{"review": "I bought this oven over a year ago. It's been one of the best purchases I've ever made. I got it for $999 and love it. The top burners are great. I didn't think I would use the middle oval burner as much as I do but it really comes in handy for grilling. The top smaller oven gets used probably 90% of the time. I make a lot of homemade pizza in it. The top also has a broiler that gets used a lot. The bottom is much larger and has a convection fan. I have only used the bottom oven a couple of times but it's great when you are trying to cook two things at once or want to keep something warm in one and cook in the other. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "I've had this dual oven for a while now and all things considered, it is a very good looking unit and the performance outside of the center burner is very good. The dual oven feature is great and helps when cooking multiple items. I've used the convection on the lower oven a few times now and has worked well with both desserts as well as dinner items like casseroles and lasagnas. The upper smaller oven heats up quickly and although the grate doesnt slide as well as it should, the oven works quite well. The main beef I have with this unit is the low BTU output (8k) of the center burner. When speaking with multiple associates about this, they say it isn't supposed to be your main cooking option and that's why the output isnt great. I kind of took this with a grain of salt but after using the center burner and griddle combo for a little bit of time now, I have unfortunately concluded that its just not enough heat emitting from it. I was trying to be patient the first few times and didnt write this review until I gave it a fair shake but after using it this weekend 2 more times, I sadly have to say that it just doesn't have the punch to really cook something sufficiently. I'm not looking for a super high sear or a charring effect but when it takes 2+ minutes to finally have the bubbles of a pancake surface, I think that is just a little too long. Also since this griddle is a little thin compared to the other brands (GE and KitchenAid were much thicker and heavier while Samsung was roughly the same density), there seemed to be a couple more hot spots (near the back half) than I would have expected. I don't want to knock this oven entirely since most of the competitors are between 8k-10k BTU's as well so this might just be the industry standard. Again I would have just wished that the heat output be just a little higher in order to give this center burner a little more versatility than what it currently is. Outside of this, the oven looks great and performs quite well.", "id": "3741411"}

{"review": "everything works as advertised and it is an easy to use range. I did not give 5 star rating because I have not had it long enough to say if it is reliable.

Also the griddle really needs to be a couple inches wider.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "This is a great stove - I like having two different stoves in one. That way I can heat-up a snack in the smaller stove and not use as much energy as heating a whole oven.

You'll use the top oven most often for smaller meals as it is faster to heat a smaller space and uses less gas. Full size oven is on the bottom and can also be run as convection.

It's not annoying to me at all. The other sounds in our house drown out the clicks (the clicks are not loud ) speaking of sounds this stove has all types of melody type sounds for settings. this has worked out very well for us we are very happy with this stove.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "Saved money by purchasing this on Amazon with free shipping. Delivery was simple (they call to schedule delivery and again before they arrive). Make sure you utilize your opportunity to inspect the product before accepting it (our was fine with no damage, but if it had been damaged I would have refused delivery). Installation is easy: connect a power cable and install the anti-tip bracket. It's been working great so far. I will leave it to the other reviewers to describe the features. The only thing I want to mention is that the infrared broiler, unlike stand-alone infrared broilers which cook at very high temperatures (>1000°F), is merely a \"speed broiler\". Don't get me wrong, it heats to 500°F in about three seconds, but just don't mistake it for a true high-temp. infrared broiler. Update: Here are my updated thoughts after using the range for a couple of weeks: Pros: The electric cooktop heats incredibly quick. Once the oven has completed preheating, the oven light flashes a couple times every minute until you acknowledge it (so you don't forget). The cooktop is easy to clean using the included supplies. Cons: I've decided that the infrared broiler is not worth the additional cost. In retrospect I would've purchased the LG model without it (the 3035). The infrared broiler consists of a metallic sheath that surrounds the broil element. I feel like it increases the surface area of the broiler which causes more smoke and flare-ups. It'll also surely add to the complexity and difficulty of eventually repairing/replacing the broiler. Also, the \"EasyClean\" features has proved to be less than useful. The way it works is you basically spray water on the oven walls and then pour some additional water in the bottom of the oven. It heats to about 200°F for 20 minutes, then you wipe-down everything with a sponge. I broiled bratwursts the other day and the spraying juice burned onto the glass on the door, and so far I've been unable to clean it off. I'm not sure that \"EasyClean\" really makes it any easier to clean than other ovens. Despite these things I am still happy with our purchase and would recommend the LG brand of ranges.", "id": "3741411"}

The top \"pizza\" oven is very fast to preheat. The bottom oven with convection setting cooks faster and at a lower temperature than we expected it to. The bright blue oven coating is super easy to clean. Thanks to the all digital controls it is very to use with very predictable results.", "id": "3741411"}

I am very diligent about performing research on every product I purchase and I was thoroughly pleased with the features and reviews. Although we have only had this for a few days, she loves her \"high-tech\" toy. The double oven was the main selling point with the convection feature a close second. The expandable cook top elements are fantastic and fit even our largest pans. The oven preheats very fast and even plays a fancy little tune when preheated. Although we haven't cleaned the oven yet, the EasyClean feature looks very helpful. A cleaning kit is also included that contains the spray bottle, scraper, and sponge.

{"review": "My wife and I just got this delivered on Sept. 22nd, which I believe is the first day it was available for sale as it's a new model. She's always wanted a double oven, and we don't have the space for the typical wall model in our condo. I must say it's quite the impressive sight. It looks expensive - and it should because it is expensive for a non-luxury brand. But you get what you pay for - the quality is there and you can see and feel the difference between this and your typical $1,400 range. It comes with an iron grill/griddle that runs on the center 5th burner (the existing grate must first be removed). The iron grates are much lighter than many stoves, so they are easy to remove for cleaning. GE has an excellent reputation for its gas ranges as per Consumer Reports, and I expect this one to be no different. The cooking performance has been excellent on both the stovetop and the oven so far. We haven't tried the convection function yet though, so can't comment on that. It has a tri-ring burner which is basically three burners in one. It's kind of hard to explain, but really cool once you see it in person. You have separate controls for both ovens on the keypad, which is really easy to operate with just a touch. It can be locked for cleaning or to keep children from playing with it. The upper oven is the smaller one. It's good for pizzas, cookies, cakes, and other smaller food dishes. It's probably the one most people will use most often. The lower oven is the bigger one you'll use for roasts, turkeys and other bulkier foods. The upper oven contains the broiler, while the lower oven has convection capability. A few notes of caution about this model: 1) You give up the storage drawer most ranges have, so be prepared to store all your pans elsewhere; 2) If you have problems bending down or picking up heavy food trays from down low, this model is not for you. The lower oven is basically on the floor and can be hard to access; 3) This model is slightly deeper than many ovens - be sure to measure before buying to ensure nearby cabinet doors and drawers will still open without hitting it; 4) Lastly, understand that this is a slide-in model, which means the sides aren't finished and you'll have a gap between the back of the range and the wall if your space isn't made for this type of range. All said, this was a fantastic purchase, and we're very happy with it so far. At the time of this writing, according to GE this range is a one of a kind - it is currently the only double oven slide-in gas range made. There is a stand-alone version in gas/electric (finished sides and backsplash) and an electric slide-in version of this model for those who prefer those types of ranges. People who desire Wolf, Viking, Dacor, etc. need not apply, as this is not a wanna-be pro range meant to compete with those, as they start at $1-2K more. But it compares favorably with GE's higher-end Cafe and Monogram lines. If you're shopping for the top of the line of a mid-tier brand and you can afford one, I highly recommend this model.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "I just received this range and love it so far but it's only been a few days. I agree with everything in previous post and wanted to add clarity regarding fit. This range sits FLUSH with your back wall. It also has a lip on each side of the cooktop that gives appearance of sitting on top of countertops. So it is a combo free standing/slide-in style.This coolness was large factor in my selection. You don't need that \"special piece\" on back wall yet it looks custom like a slide-in. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because I just got it AND it is exactly 30 inches wide. My cutout is 30 inches and previous range was about 1/8 narrower so I never anticipated a fit issue. However, my installer had to tap my granite over a bit and then finesse range into place. Fortunately this was an option with my counter configuration... so make sure you measure. Either way it's beautiful!", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "First review in some time, but I know all are leery of doing a purchase this big online. I am very happy with the look of the range and the packaging for safety of the materials was perfect and extreme, not simply just in a shipping box. This range if not actually looked at in store, which should be done, has an overlap on range top so that food can not fall in the gap between the stove and cabinets. Since this is a 1/2 inch overlap on each side make sure measurements and height of counter are considered. The leveling legs have about a 2 inch rise MAX... and be careful when extended this high things get wobbly and legs may bend if not on perfectly smooth floor and leg catches on sliding in. So that would be my first negative, week leveling leg brackets. The second and last negative is that I had read in past where this range arrived dead on arrival.... I had a similar issue, plugged in and nothing, no power. I then looked at the line cord for the range, it is not hard wired, and as such found the plug on end of line cord had one wire out three not secured / push looked into the connector. I had to call GE for a tech to be dispatched (1 week), but begged her to have tech have part in hand and not simply come out to look and not resolve since delay was 1 week. I the meantime I was able to push the loose wire into the back via the connector to make good connection till correctly repaired and not loose. So this may explain a dead on arrival / no power. Quality control on the line cord... But besides that love the look all seems to work fine with burners. Have not used oven convection but that will next. I went to a big box store, did measurements and made sure I liked the look then the price search was on. I was able to get this range 500 dollars cheaper plus the no tax savings. I expected that the shipping, free in my case per say, would take a few weeks and it took 1 week to go coast to coast and then 1 week to get from shipper to house.", "id": "3741411"}

Center burner? Cooks awesome once I realized I'm supposed to remove the grate and put the griddle between the 2 side grates ... go figure. Also, our installer explained our 1970's home had a 3/8\" gas line when the stove was really designed for a 1/2\" line (I think that's right) and the heat quality with all 4 burners + the center burner when all were on might be diminished. So far we haven't used everything at once and it would be rare if we did. We love the super burner -- heats whatever we are cooking quickly, and then simmers to perfection. The top oven is regular gas and not convection; the lower can cook either convection or gas; we wish the top was dual option too... we love both ovens -- the center rack on the bottom has bearings or something that makes it roll out easily. We love that. The range is a slide in, but the top overlaps the counter so spills won't link down between the range and cabinet.

Heavy duty grates, includes a very nice griddle for the center burner, heavy powder coated interior components. Lower oven has a well made gliding shelf to make things easier to work with. Only thing to note is that the lower oven is very low from what you are used to. The upper oven is pretty small height wise, but you should still get two large casserole dishes in side by side if need be.

{"review": "I just wrote a long review of this product and Amazon deleted it so I am going to do the short version for my follow-up and maybe come back and add to it if/when I have time. I am happy with this purchase, which I've had for 2 months. It cooks beautifully and with even heat, it is made of strong materials and the cast iron grates, especially, feel super heavy-duty. Stove top cleans up easily with soap and water. Oven bakes and roasts wonderfully (especially in the convection setting). My food has never looked so perfectly browned. I wanted to give it 4.5 stars but didn't have the option. So, I gave it 4 (and not 5) stars because the stainless stovetop area does scratch easily, although I knew that going in and have been careful with it. The knobs do get warm when the oven is on, but not so much so that I can't handle them with a bare hand. There is also a fan in the rear that comes on when the oven is on (and for a period of time after, until it cools). It is quiet enough and doesn't bother us. I don't think a range of this size can NOT have a fan to help cool it and given the design, it has to be in the rear. All in all, I love my new range.

I looked into a high end professional range however, considering the cost of that along with the required hood, it was over budget and over kill.

I have never had an oven that was this even. Two mini muffin pans at the same time with every muffin the same color! Some reviews complained about the sound of the convection fan but mine is so quiet that I thought it wasn't working. The knobs never got to hot at all.

{"review": "We have had this range since April and after some tweaking by the GE rep the oven is now working better. There are now scratches on the front stainless trim due to the burner grates rubbing against it quickly when lifting out (heavy). Not fun having scratches on a new appliance. The coating on the non-stick griddle for the middle burner started peeling off after the first use. GE sent us a replacement which I just received and the coating looks almost bare in spots -- very poor quality -- I will not use it. So if you buy this range, you'd want to think about how to utilize that oval elongated middle burner. I'd prefer it were a round one. We bought this range after returning a Viking D3 which did not work from the start and because they didn't have their own repair people, and because we hated paying $4k for something that was defective from the start, we got the GE instead. GE say they are the only manufacturer with their own service reps, which does appeal. If I were remodeling a kitchen again I would be sure to have a separate oven and cooktop.

{"review": "We purchased the dual fuel version of this range (gas cooktop and electric ovens). The gas cooktop has excellent burners - they simmer at extremely low heat and do just as well with high heat. The main oven BAKES extremely well. (My wife was the Betty Crocker Homemaker of the year when she was in high school.) We haven't tried the drawer oven, but we have faith that it could easily handle a caserole or buns while baking another item at a different temperature in the main oven. One thing we found out when buying this range: it is classed as free standing AND as a slide-in. For those wanting a free-standing oven (including us), GE offers a matching stainless steel \"backsplash\" JXS80SS, which definitely dresses up the cooktop. After the nightmares we had with the Electrolux EW30GF65GS range that (thankfully) we were able to invoke the \"lemon policy\", we are absolutely thrilled that this GE Cafe range actually performs the way it's supposed to! Yes, it was fairly expensive, but it has been worth every penny!", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "The cook top is just perfect. I have been suffering for a while with a glass top, and the superiority of gas is hard to describe. The different burner sizes give amazing control and I love it. The oven, however, is a problem. It won't get to temperature, and so the convection does not work. Apparently when it is on, there is also a slight gas leak. So slight, I had not noticed it. Left the house, came back in and was alarmed at the smell. Called GE, got a computer answering phone tree. They auto generated a service tech for a week later. WOW. My stove is now a very large paper weight until they come. LOUSY service. Went from being thrilled to terribly disappointed. I had used this range, in the dual fuel variety, in a rental unit a while back. That oven worked ok, but the fan noise was VERY obtrusive. This one is quieter, but still loud WHEN it works. Now if it just wasn't trying to kill me.....", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "Pro's: everything on it works and works well. In this day and age with poor quality workmanship in most appliances I feel lucky just having all the features work without bringing in a repair man. Nice looking range with sturdy quality components. Con's: large high power burner front right which is normally where I like to have a smaller simmer burner for delicate cooking so that I can keep a close eye on the dish. The high power burner is seldom needed except for boiling stuff and stocks which I usually have on the back burner. This is a poor design, but I can live with it. Also, fan is noisy, my wife complains of this, but I just turn the TV a little louder. Overall it is a quality range with a couple of design flaws I was familiar with prior to purchase which have not created a negative experience while cooking.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "We are very pleased with our new stove and its ease of operation. The only negative so far is that when the oven temperature goes over 350 an exhaust fan starts up which is fairly noisy with a warble sound in it. The griddle which comes with the stove work very well and easy to switch out for the middle grate and easy to clean.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "I love this stove! We looked at several with two ovens or an oven & a 'baking drawer' (like this one), but most of them had the large oven on the bottom. I couldn't imagine stooping to the floor to put a turkey in there & doubt I would be able to keep my dogs out as the bottom oven door opened to the floor. This one has the drawer on the bottom-perfect! We also like the look & durability of the cast iron grates. The middle burner has been useful and my husband (who is a chef) loves the simmer feature for his sauces. Would highly recommend : )", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "Be prepared: this range is HEAVY! Pros: gas burners boil water so much faster than my old electric. Oven is roomy and cooks evenly. Griddle is a fun bonus. This range is very attractive and gives the kitchen a high quality look without being ostentatious. Cons: little bottle of stainless steel brightener that came in the packaging leaked on some of the racks and caused some corrosion, but seller has promised replacements. Delivery driver didn't bring a partner to help him. Very tough job for one person.", "id": "3741411"}
{"review": "The part is an exact replacement-Nice!! The GE counter top mounted ceramic cook top is, however, another story, folks. I have resolved to NEVER purchase another GE Profile or any other Ge product. Thus far every one of the 5 Profile kitchen products we bought has crashed and needed repair. Lousy Chinese workmanship. They called it BUILT IN OBSOLESCENCE! Yep-keeping their techs busy by design, no less. Each and everyone has broken down. Thanks to the WWW. there are enough nice folks that did take the time to record their efforts of their own attempts at fixing these crap products. I could not find, however, any \"HOW TO\" ON HOW TO REPLACE THIS ONE! Took a bit of time, but got-er done. Even found the ever elusive wiring schematic INSIDE the cooking enclosure-STUPID PLACE to put paper inside a MULTI 2500 watts cooking enclosure. That alone speaks volumes about what their product is all about. If you need help with yours, watch the WWW.

{"review": "Not that they are super sturdy, but these covers are sturdier than I expected from other reviewers. I was worried they would show smudges or dust more than the steel looking ones, and they do show dust (not as bad as I expected though) but they are really pretty good about not showing smudges. They are not exactly matte but not super glossy either (have a \"grain\" to them that is nice). Good for the price and better than what I have been able to find in Target, etc.", "id": "3741411"}

{"review": "We originally purchased a compact fridge to keep downstairs. Rush, not full knowledge of how different these work,was #1 Priority when I became wheelchair bound and spent most of my time on the lower level of our home. The wrong decision (freezer never used) resulted in a freon leak because the freezer had never been defrosted. After getting the 3-yr-old mistake (not an Amazon product) outside, I went on a hunt for info on what would seem as an easy task. I followed the advice of NO freezer and use of metal shelves (keeps everything evenly cold). With those parameters in mind, I inserted my Amazon search criteria and instantaneously received the perfect result: Danby Designer DAR044A1BDD Compact All Refrigerator, 4.4 Cubic Feet. It only took a half a day to recognize its sizable storage capacity without the fear of ice build-up and the free flow of cold air passing through the laminated steel open shelves. Reasonably priced and Prime 2-day free delivery. If you are a parent looking for the best compact fridge for a dorm room, this most definitely what you want. Worth every penny of the approx. online price of 200 bucks.", "id": "3741361"}
{"review": "Unfortunately, confirmed by a phone call to Danby customer service, this fridge has a 41 degree max cold temperature when empty, and (per the user manual) floats up to 45 degrees under normal operation. I used a thermometer on each level, and when empty the top shelf registered 42, middle 45,and bottom 48. As a glance at any fridge thermometer or food storage recommendation to prevent spoilage will reveal, safe temp ranges from 35 to 40 degrees MAXIMUM. This is a problem with an all fridge unit folks; even though that little freezer section in the combo compact units is admittedly silly and almost useless, it drives down the ambient temp of the fridge to 35 to 37 degrees or so by leaking cold air inside the compartment (I have two of them), while a fridge only unit like this one has much higher temps. So its back to the combo unit for my third purchase. This will be fine for beverages only, but not acceptable for food. UPDATE July 30th - ordered the Haier 4 Cubic Foot fridge with (tiny) freezer, and its now at a cold 35 degrees from top to bottom at 6 of 7 cold setting.", "id": "3741361"}
{"review": "I decided on this refrigerator when I recently moved into a new place. I was looking for something to fit under my bar in my garage. I did not want a freezer to waste precious beer space, and this is one of the few without one. I like the adjustable shelves to accommodate bottles or cans however desired. But the metal wire is a little annoying; if you don't place the bottles on them just right, they lean or tip over. It definitely keeps things cold, in fact be careful how cold you set it. Being not too bright, I filled it with beer, set it as cold as it could go, and waited for the weekend. I had friends over for a housewarming and discovered I had a fridge full of frozen beer. Oops! So far so good on the function, we'll see how it does in a garage in AZ in the summer.", "id": "3741361"}

My staff and I are very pleased. All plusses; no negatives!", "id": "3741361"}

{"review": "Bought to convert to kegerator. Runs quietly, keeps kegs at about 42 degrees F with thermostat at the mid-range setting. After very minor modifications, refrigerator holds (2) 5-gallon cornelius kegs & 5LB. CO2 tank inside. No coolant lines in the top panel of the fridge between the light fixture and back panel made installing a keg tower tap easy.", "id": "3741361"}
{"review": "I'm not any particular expert on refrigerators, but I can say that this fridge does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it does it well. I've had it for a few months now and I love it. Pros: 1. Refrigerates drinks fairly quickly and keeps them at a comfortably cold temperature. 2. Internal design is very functional and allows you to store many different bottles and cans. 3. Operates very quietly. 4. No need to ever defrost. 5. The exterior design is simple, but pleasant. 6. It's fairly power efficient for a fridge of it's size. Cons: None that I can speak of. One minor note is to make sure you set the temperature right. If you set it too cold, it WILL freeze your drinks, even though it's labeled as strictly a refrigerator. I learned this the hard way.", "id": "3741361"}

{"review": "Evaluated from a functional perspective, the mini fridge gets 4 stars. The door pockets aren't gianormous, but are adequate for a fridge of its size. One shelf is adjustable with a fairly big range. It has leveling feet & the door's opening direction is reversible. The fit & finish is above average - the back is completely flush & none of the coils are exposed. I honestly can't think of anything more I could want in terms of the design. I'm docking it a star for the door's finish. I didn't read between the lines when I selected the model and assumed I knew what \"spotless\" steel meant. The picture make me expect that I was getting a STAINLESS steel finish. From the right angle, in the perfect light, at an adequate distance, it could pass for it. Just like a carefully selected \"selfie\" though, the actual package is less desirable. Most of the time, the fridge just looks like it has a gray door. Upon closer inspection, it's just a plastic or painted brush stroke veneer over a glossy gray finish. It's not offensive to the eyes by any means, but it definitely wasn't the sleek appliance I thought I had purchased.", "id": "3741361"}

In the door, I place coffee creamer and salad dressing. The only truly wasted space for me is the can dispenser in the door - I really don't have any use for that as I rarely drink sodas, and if I do, I don't drink I buy bottles (not cans).

As you know, small refrigerators lose their cooling very quickly, almost as fast as you open the door to get something. But this Danby has recovered quickly without my fearing something bad would happen to the food. We'll see how that works out over the next months, though. Many do not want to read anything about shipping and handling in the product review area. That's fine, but if Honda delivers a new car to my friend with a dent in the door and Honda won't fix the problem, I want to know about this from my friend. I say that here because several reviewers have reported problems like this with the Danby. Mine arrived so well packaged that it was hard to believe. No dents. Nothing like that.

{"review": "It fits right in where our RV fridge used to be. Cheaper than the parts to fix our old Dometic fridge. The cubic feet say it's slightly smaller, but we feel both the fridge and freezer section seem bigger somehow. Maybe better arrangement. LOVE the many slots to put the shelves into. Makes it easier to setup one section for tall things like milk gallons. VERY quiet. Runs on 120 watts. That's it!!! About like running two laptops. We run on solar frequently and it's nice to have such a low wattage. The Dometic needed 500watts AC when we weren't running on propane. Small drip tray in back was broken (probably from factory since the box and foam were in great shape). Contacted seller (Varouj Appliances), and they sent out a replacement immediately without having to return the old broken plastic like some sellers want you to do.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "Like other reviewers have wondered, I'm pretty sure this was a factory-damaged fridge that some seller got ahold of for cheap. Both the shipping box and the fridge box were in perfect condition, but there was a VERY large, noticeable dent on the lower of the fridge. I kept it only because it was an emergency fix for a camper fridge we need for a two-week vacation and it's getting tucked into a cabinet so the side won't be seen. If it wasn't the case, I'd be sending it right back. The fridge has been running for two full days and there's lots of condensation droplets in the fridge; I'm hoping they disappear. We also had to switch the swing of the doors which turned into a pain in the butt. The freezer seal doesn't seal completely, we're hoping it's just a result of changing the swing of the doors and the greater pressure point. If it's not, I'm certainly complaining to the seller. Find something better. I wish I wouldn't have paid $400 + for this. Super disappointed.", "id": "3741181"}

{"review": "In a moment urgency I needed a frig that would fit in the 5th wheel trailer and would be of good looks and lasting quality within hours of the frig that went out. The frig that went out ran on electricity and ammonia or propane gas which is the standard for motorhomes and trailers. They are super expensive for their size and short on endurance. I wanted to replace it with a good old fashion electric frig.

I looked at a lot of apartment size frigs' which would have cost about $1,500 and weren't narrow enough to fit through the door or fit in the existing space. I went to Amazon and saw this frig for $379.00 on sale from $699.00. Dimensions were exactly the right size and had free shipping. Ordered it right away. It showed up 3 days ahead of schedule! Before I even unpacked I knew I had a good quality product...How? This thing was packaged to withstand being dropped from an aircraft. Wow, By the time I got through 2 layers of box containers and 2 layers of foam and plastic protection I finally got to see what I purchased. Any company that would spend this much money and time on a shipping container and other protection for the product must be proud of what they built. The frig looked great, modern looking and inside had a lot more space than I ever imagined. Fit through the door, a truly memorable moment and then installed it, plugged it in and was up to operating temperature in about an half hour. Time will tell on operating quality but I suspect I got a pretty good product. And as always Amazon was top notch in the ease of ordering, the shipping and and followup on the order. The tenant was really pleased on the looks and room inside the frig also. He was amazed how fast I got the frig also, I didn't tell them how much I paid.

{"review": "I had an old Panasonic rice cooker which had performed faithfully for almost 20 years, but it didn't have a Teflon pot and tended to scorch rice on the bottom -- especially brown rice. After reading countless reviews of various rice cookers, I decided to chance the Aroma ARC-914SBD. My experience has confirmed some of the tips and observations of previous reviews: ~ To avoid calamities, follow the directions in the user's manual, not what's on the rice package or what you used to do when cooking on the stove top. I was particularly surprised that brown rice takes no more water than white rice, but turns out beautifully. ~ The term \"cup\" does not mean an 8 ounce cup. It's actually 3/4 of a cup (6 ounces). I quickly discovered that trying to convert this idiosyncratic measurement scheme to standard English measurement is more trouble than it's worth. Just do what the directions say. ~ There's good reasons for this cooker's taking longer than stovetop cooking or what my old rice cooker took. It intentionally heats brown rice more slowly and apparently cooks at a lower temperature than with white rice. That's fine with me, since the result is perfectly cooked brown rice! ~ The top assembly is slightly more awkward to clean than a simple removable glass or metal top would be. It's really not much of an issue, but others have noticed it also. ~ The maximum capacity is claimed to be eight cups of cooked rice, which is actually six - 8 ounce cups. This is fine for one or two people, but may not be large enough for more people. After only a few days of ownership, I'm very pleased with the performance of this unit, but obviously I'm not yet able to comment about reliability or customer service.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I love this rice cooker. I had a rice cooker before and know how to cook it on stove-top but this makes it so much more convenient and easy. Cooks rice perfectly and is great for making steamed food and even stews and soups. Check out their website for recipes or just do a Google search for rice cooker or even steamer recipes. This rice cooker does come with a rice spatula which I wish it was more clear on since amazon does suggest to buy another set. It's not of the highest quality but it's plenty good for most everyone and won't break any time soon. It also has a water/steam collection container behind the lid on the right side of the electronic interface. Be sure to empty it every now and then, not essentially vital but if you don't, it'll eventually start leaking from being overfilled. I didn't notice it at first so wanted to let you guys know. I know this is obvious but be careful not to touch the steam vent while it's on. I'm a curious cat and I touched it and almost instantly burnt myself. :( No worries though, it's far from the handle.

{"review": "I've had several rice cookers in the past, enjoyed them all and this is no exception. My last rice cooker, Zujirushi brand, only lasted 2 years before kicking the bucket, which was kinda odd since the past cookers lasted closer to 5. This is my first time trying the Aroma brand and so far, the experience is pretty nice. Coming from a guy who is use to the simple \"one-click\" function cookers, I thought this was easy to use. I've been using this on a weekly basis for about a month and so far no issues. Rice cooks a little bit longer than I'm accustomed to (about 20 mins for 3 cups of white rice), but the rice comes out great. Haven't use the steamer function yet. I've read some unhappy reviews about the rice being too dry, not cooked or too watery... I've had none of that. If it comes out too watery, you're probably adding too much water. Undercooked, it's probably broken. Too dry, you didn't add enough water. What most people don't understand, rice by different brands/variety will absorb water differently. You have to go judge how much water to put in by the rice you put in. I use Jasmine rice and the water marking on the pot is spot on. For $30-ish, I think this is a good deal.

It also makes a mess, spurting starchy water everywhere. I don't like the attached lid as it makes clean-up take longer. UPDATE: For anyone else who asks about cooking small amounts, I put in 1/2 cup dry brown rice and it cooked perfect.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I recently bought this to sharpen all of my kitchen knives which had gone dull over the years. At first, I didn't think it worked too well. But then I went to the Edgeware website and watched their YouTube video on how to use it, and realized that you may have to pull the knife throught the sharpener up to 10 times to get it sharp. (I was initially only pulling it through a couple times.) After pulling through the knives about 5 times, the knives did indeed get very sharp. For my knives, I pulled them through the \"course\" side 5-6 times, then through the \"fine\" side about 4 times. Seemed to work well for me. Another tip I learned by watching Edgeware's YouTube video, was to set the sharpener on the edge of the counter at a 45 degree angle. (That's apparently what the v-shaped groove is for on the bottom of the sharpener.) When the sharpener is on the edge, you can pull the knives straight through and down without worrying about hitting the countertop and scratching it or breaking the tip off your knife. Lastly, I'm not sure why some reviewers say that this only works on small knives. I used it on small knives, as well as all of my larger chef style knives. The process is exactly the same no matter the size of the knife. So it should work the same, and indeed it worked just fine on all of my small and large knives.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I have a small kitchen and just a few drawers. So, I need to save space, and this sharpener has the size that I was looking without losing quality. The first impression was that it wouldn't last long, but after 4 months it still works perfectly and my knives are always in the perfect shape.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is a magnificent little sharpener. As a former professional chef, I can honestly say if this product had been available twenty years ago I would have had one. When the blade dulls the work is slower and more likely to result in inferior cuts and accidental cuts. If you follow the instructions you'll have a razor sharp knife in about one minute. For the money, this is the BEST product for the kitchen I've seen in years! Thank you for making my food prep easier & better.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I purchased this knife sharpener because the price was right. I wanted a spare knife sharpener to keep at my camper. It will sharpen knives just as well as more expensive two stage sharpeners do. The cutters are fixed so you can't replace them. At the price who cares, buy a new one and save the aggravation of replacing cutters at $7 a pop.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I bought this specifically for some inexpensive \"Farberware Pro\" knives, for which it matched the factory bevel very well. I have not tried it with any other knives, but I imagine Farberware's grind is fairly typical of most kitchen knives being sold today. This sharpener is not comparable to a stone or similar systems when faced with varied or more complex grinds, and is not going anywhere near the cleaver, for example. However, the carbide bits are very aggressive, much better than typical \"coarse\" ceramic sharpeners, and could probably regrind a knife fairly quickly. The \"fine\" ceramic rods are standard fare. The grip looked small in the picture but, combined with the traction from the rubber bottom, proved comfortable and completely secure. Of the fixed angle, countertop sharpeners I have encountered, this is the best designed and I expect to replace it with same model when it wears out.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is a fantastic product. It's inexpensive, ergonomically friendly, and sharpens very well. Because it is both small and attractive, I can leave it on the kitchen counter beside my knife block for very quick, easy touch-up sharpening (use the ceramic slot for this purpose). You may or may not want to buy an expensive electric sharpener to sharpen all your knives a couple of times a year, but you definitely want to have a Smith's Edge Grip handy so you can easily keep your edges sharp on a day-to-day basis.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Man, this thing is tiny! I don't mention that because it affects it's performance, I was just surprised, as it appears larger in the pictures. This sharpener performs well, with plenty of rubber coating on it for a good hand grip and good traction on the counter.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "This item is easy to use, and works well, it needs to be over a cutting board to protect counter tops from slipping knives though and there is a learning curve to getting all of the blade sharp.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I was never a fan of the sharpening rod that came with my knives. It never seemed to get them as sharp as I hoped and not to mention it seemed to take a special skill to sharpen the knives without taking too much of the blade and to sharpen at the right angle so as I make things even. I always worried I was doing things wrong or taking too much metal off my knife. This does succeed in making knife sharpening easy. I like that it guides the knife through so there is less guesswork about angles. But I do worry at times that it is still taking too much off my knife and that I might be better off getting them professionally sharpened. This product does get my knives sharper, but it is not a miracle product. My knives, yes, are sharper, but still not close to what they were the day I pulled them out of the package.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is my second Black & Decker toaster oven in the past eight years, and I really couldn't be more satisfied. I've only replaced the first one because it did get a little dirty over time. Ours is next to the stove, so it got some splatters on it. Not a fault of the toaster oven. Does it work well? Yes. Toasts four pieces of toast quickly. Its a toaster and it does its job. As an oven is where it really comes in handy. If you have kids, its a great, quick way to heat up chicken nuggets or whatever. Excellent for leftovers. You can stick two slices of pizza in there and heat them up quickly. There is a crumb tray in the bottom that is easy to pull out and clean. Before you buy this toaster oven though, what I would alert you to is that its on the larger side. Takes up more space on the counter than some other units you might find. Check out the measurements and make sure it will work for you. The width and height are more the issue than the depth. My only small complaint with this toaster oven is the plug. It uses one of those large three prongs, so it is kind of a big plug that sticks out of the wall quite a bit. I think it would have been better for B&D to attach a right angle plug on the end just for appearances sake.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I've had several toaster ovens over the years. A few years back I got frustrated with trying to find one that actually worked like it was supposed to and made it a personal quest to find that perfect toaster/convection counter top oven. This one is in the smaller range that I didn't do much searching through since I was looking for one to take the place of my broken oven in my gas stove. As a basic, small toaster oven this is a pretty good one. It has a expanded back so that it can bake a small pizza up to 8\" dia. It has simple controls. One knob that you turn to set the temp that you want and a second knob to set the timer. That's it. No digital temp controls, no multiple functions to select one from. It preheats in just a minute or two so it's quick and easy to use and doesn't use a lot of electricity. My Oster Convection Toaster Oven is about twice the size of this one and is the one that I chose after test driving 7 or 8 different ones 2 or 3 years ago. There are a few things that this smaller one is more suitable to use instead of the bigger one so the two complement each other. And now I hardly use my microwave for anything other than re heating my cup of coffee. Just one thing to remember. This is a toaster OVEN. So don't expect it to toast your Bagels by just sticking them in it, turning it on to Toast, and go off to another room doing something else and expect your Bagels to toast and NOT get BURNED. That's why a normal toaster pops the toast up after its finished the toast cycle. So you have to watch this as it toasts what ever it is that you are toasting. So that you can remove it as soon as it is toasted to that perfect color that you like. I just mention this because in my research of toaster ovens I found that several people had wrote negative reviews on several toaster ovens because they almost burned their kitchen down when they went off doing something else after putting their Bagels in it to toast them. And of course, since they were not there to remove them when they were done, after the toaster oven turned off the Bagels continued to sit in the hot oven and started to burn. So they blamed the toaster oven instead of themselves for not paying attention to it. I'm pretty sure that in the directions on these things that it tells you in one way or another, do not leave it unattended. One other thing for those that are concerned about it. This one does have a grounded plugin on it. The cord is nice and heavy, if a little on the short side. Most of the toaster ovens that I've tried in the last several years have the polarized plugin. So if you have a older home that doesn't have grounded outlets in the kitchen you might want to look for another one or order a plugin adapter while you are ordering this. So if you are looking for a basic, simple, small toaster oven, this will probably fill that need. If you are looking for something to actually replace using your big oven in your stove for most of those smaller baking jobs then you probably wouldn't be happy with this. For that I would suggest the; Oster TSSTTVMNDG Digital Large Capacity Toaster Oven, Black/Polished Stainless Accents After I did my research on these a few years ago that was the one I decided was the keeper and I'm still happy with it.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "PROS *It' a great, small size and will fit easily into your kitchen. *It has what seems like a very short cord though it's three pronged for extra grounding. *It heats up fairly quickly; the sides get warm but still touchable even on the highest setting of 450 however the top gets much warmer so you'll want to be careful not to touch it and to keep it away from other surfaces. *It has a timer that can be set for anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes and it alarms you when the time is up unless you choose the `stay on' feature. *There are bake, broil and toast settings. *It comes with a detachable crumb tray, a baking rack and a small baking sheet. *The temperature gauge is accurate though it might run on the cool side but not by much. CONS *A regular, family size 11\" pizza will not fit in this oven though 4 slices of regular bread fit snugly. *It doesn't heat evenly though I've yet to find an oven, especially a toaster oven, that does. You'll need to keep turning the food as it cooks. *Though the lid, which opens out and down, closes easily there's not a snap to tell you it's in place so you'll need to be conscious of making sure you have it completely closed. GENERAL INFORMATION *The settings are in English and French. *It arrives protectively packed. *An instruction manual is included yet the design functions are intuitive.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This toaster works very well making four evenly toasted slices of bread and it seems to do so more quickly than most. The temperature seems to be accurate after pre-heating. Comes with a removable crumb tray, non-adjustable rack and broiler drip tray. Just the right size for a one layer ,8 in. square cake. They make a big deal about it being the right size for a nine inch pizza but I think 9 inches is about standard depth for a four-slice oven. It has a 30 minute timer but I like the \"stay-on\" feature for something that takes longer than 30 minutes ,like meat-loaf. Also works for keeping stuff warm. Reasonably priced and doesn't look as cheaply made as some Black and Decker products. By the way, Amazon has a very nice set of pans for toaster ovens. \"Chicago metallic non-stick pans\"", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Settled for this one for not being too big nor small. Does what it says and does it well. Pros; Efficient, size is great, heats fast and evenly.

{"review": "In my opinion, well designed, simple toaster oven. It does, in fact, produce a reasonably even toast...much better than my old, more expensive oven. The crumb tray covers the whole bottom, and is easy to remove for cleaning. A bonus feature that I didn't realize it had, they have wires so that you can actually suspend the broiler pan below the toasting rack to catch dripping stuff (cheese, fat, whatever) and keep it off the bottom element, useful for the broiling function. The timer does \"tick\" quietly, and the \"done\" bell is also not too loud. I haven't used it for baking, so I can't speak to that, but as for toasting and heating things up, it works very well. The toasting rack does not pop out when you open the door, which personally, I prefer.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Yes, I like this toaster oven. However, when they say 4-slice toaster they are pushing it a bit unless the bread slices are small. It does a nice job and is easy to keep clean. Also, the price was good and I have found their products to be reliable.", "id": "289913"}

With a family that eats at all different times of the day, this is the easiest way to go to heating up a variety of foods. It toasts, grills, broils, bakes...what else could you ask for?

{"review": "I got this for my 17 year old son to make smoothies. He made the most delicious peach smoothie from ice and the Big Train Fruit Tea Smoothie Blast syrup also bought on Amazon. The consistency was smooth and perfect, just like a professional frozen drink. I asked him to make me one. On the second smoothie the motor died. We thought maybe it needed a little \"rest\" but sadly, it was the end of the road for that blender. When pressed for details, my son admitted that he noticed a burning smell before the motor stopped dead, and yet he kept pressing that button! Bottom line: great design, lightweight, nice personal cup size, easy storage and cleanup. The motor is just not very powerful, and can't take long blending times. Still, we are going to order a replacement and see if a bit more TLC while blending gives this blender better shelf life. Seems like it worked for some of the other reviewers. Update: we got the new blender and it is working out great. You just have to be careful to pulse the blender as you go along, and stop for a few seconds (10?) if you start to smell the motor smell. Ice is blended into drinks very well, with no big chunks. The only downside is the no dishwasher requirement. I feel pretty tempted to try it, but as this is already the second blender I will resist.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I was looking for an inexpensive small personal blender that was powerful, easy to use, and could blend a perfect smoothie. I did a lot of research and looked into about a dozen other brands including the famed \"Magic Bullet\". What I found out was that not all personal blenders are made equal. The \"Magic Bullet\" didn't get very good reviews even though it is by far the most popular. After all my intense research, I settled on this one... The Hamilton Beach Single Serve Blender. Here's the scoop on what makes this surprising blender the \"cream of the crop\" :) Pros: -Simple and easy to use -Easy to Clean -Powerful enough to chop frozen fruits (and probably ice too) -Pulse button allows you more control because you can start or stop it. -Seems very sturdy and only has 3 parts to it. (lid, glass, and base) -This thing is freaking cheap... got mine for $15. -Blends Smoothies perfectly with no unchopped pieces of fruit. -Power cord can be tucked in and wrapped around bottom of base for storage. Cons: -Emits a slight 'burnt oil' odor while it is in operation... but it's not as bad as it sounds. -The Lid seems kind of flimsy. Conclusion: At $15 this little blender is not only a bargain, it gets the job done and does it well! In fact, it works just as well as my friend's personal blender which costs more than twice the amount I spent on this one. The elegance and simplicity of the design is also to be admired. The plastic blending container also doubles as a travel mug and the Lid to it doubles as a sipping lid when used as a travel mug. It's a nice surprise to see a product in which you can see that they put a lot of thought into it's design. It's positive aspects greatly outshine the few negatives... especially when considering the price. So if you need an amazing blender but you're on a budget, pick this one up and never look back! By the way, this thing is also available elsewhere... like \"Wally World\" and \"Target\" ...and at the same low price :)", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "The other day I impulsivley went and bought a Hamilton Beach Juicer. When I got it home I hemmed and hawed, wondering if I should use it or not. Did I really want it? I started looking around the internet and realized what I really wanted was something to make smoothies or other fruit concoctions. I researched a few things like the Magic Bullet and Ultimate Chopper but both had mixed reviews. I was tempted to buy the Tribest blender because it had some good reviews here at Amazon but I could only find it online and it's listed at $60 - much more than what I really wanted to spend. Instead, I went to my local Walmart and to see what they had. I saw the Hamilton Beach Personal Blender and it was priced for only $13.67 so I was interested. It's just me, so I don't need a huge and heavy unit taking up what little counter space I have. I also figured since that if I bought it at Walmart and that if I didn't like it I could easily return it. I brought it home, looked over the manual and attempted my first smoothie. I threw in milk, strawberries, frozen raspberries and hit the button. I needed to blend it some more because of the raspberries being frozen. Live and learn, I should have done those first. I put in some ice and blended it some more. It came out wonderful! The jar itself can be used as a serving glass. I probably will only use it in that manner at home. It has no handle so I'd be afraid I'd drop it when I was out. Then the blender would be worthless because the blade is in the jar. * Jar twists and locks into place on the base * Comes with a travel lid to take your drink on the go * Cord wraps around the base * Not intended for all food - manual says not to process hard foods such as cheese, crackers or meat. A maximum of 12 tablespoons can be ground at a time. Do not try to mash potatoes, mix stiff dough, whip egg whites, grind raw meat or extract juice from fruit or veggies. * Container cover has filler cap that can be removed to insert small objects when blending * Can not use big chunks of ice. You need to break them down. I have an ice tray where the shape is a small circle (half ball) and it was fine. Perhaps this is what you can use those holiday themed ice trays for. Some of those sizes which I have seem I think would work in this. * NOT dishwasher safe - but easy clean up - rinse, put water and soap in jar, blend for a minute, empty, rinse again and you're done. * No complicated speeds or choices - one push button * I can't find it on the box or in the manual but according to Amazon, the motor has 175 watts of power I just went and made another smoothie! Banana, Vanilla soy milk, little bit of chocolate syrup and instant coffee. Yummy! This one site has TONS of recipes that you can use with this blender. You just have to play with the recipes because a lot of them are meant to be multiple servings. [...] * this link no longer works. Try allrecipes.com - a search of \"smoothies\" brings up 200 results. There are books totally dedicated to smoothies. Google \"smoothie\" or just use your imagination. While this might not do what a full size blender can, this is a great blender for smoothies, drinks, shakes and to grind coffee. I love that it's small, the cord wraps around the base and I can use this thing at night and not wake up the neighbors! I just came back from the grocery store and picked up some more fruit... what else can I make???", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This product is an effective and useful single-serving drink mixer that comes with a few drawbacks. It is basically a tiny kitchen blender with a pulse-blend button and no other speed settings. The mixer jar works just like a blender: it is a plastic jar with ounce/ml graduations on the side that contains a built-in mixer blade with a lug on the bottom to spin it when it is on the motor; you put the jar on top of the motor unit, twist to lock it into place (be sure the lid is on tight!), and hit the pulse button on the motor. The motor screams like a dying gerbil and the blade in the jar spins to mix your stuff. When that's done, you just pull the jar off the mixer and take it with you - blade and all. The mixer jar doubles as your drink container. The lid has a slideable spout cover for drinking from, and there is a plastic rim on the bottom so you can stand it upright. The jar is about 7 inches tall by 3.5 inches wide - so about the size of a large coffee carry-container; it holds up to 16 ounces. It is not insulated. You cannot disassemble it for cleaning; you just wash with soap and water. (I've found that pulsing the jar with some soap and warm water inside works pretty well, but it takes some effort to get down around the very bottom of the mixing blades with a brush.) The lid has a lot of grooves and crannies but it cleans up pretty well; if you're some kind of sterility fanatic, it's hard to get under the sliding spout cover, but you can rinse it with soap and water to get it clean. As to functionality, as far as this unit goes, it's fine. The mixing action is quite good, and the lid stays tightly on the jar. I've mostly used it for light powder mixes, nothing heavy; it does well with that, and takes very little pulsing to get a good mix. The directions state that it is not to be used for hot drinks, or heavy solid foods. It can probably handle fruit chunks, but it is far from a powerhouse. A few drawbacks: as noted, the motor is not strong. Others have complained that it burns out with long use; I have only used it in quick-pulse mode, and that is what I would recommend. It runs at very high speed and vibrates if you don't hold it while pulsing; I don't know how long you can expect it to last - it really does seem to be laboring with even light duty. My real complaint is the lid: the only lids provided are the \"drink-through\" type with a hole in the lid near the drinking spout, and a flat sliding cover that opens and closes the hole (it is not a positive-cover system, like some spring-loaded types - it is just a flat cover that slides in a groove back and forth over the hole). The cover is nowhere near watertight, and there is also a small airhole on the other side of the lid that has no cover at all. This means that the drink will seep out easily if you tip the jar, even with the lid on and the cover closed. Liquid also oozes up around the hole cover while you are pulsing the mixer, so the lid gets wet and dirty before you even finish making your drink. If you are carrying it in a bag or purse, you have got to be very careful never to tip the bag, and probably should enclose the drink cup in a plastic bag. This is a pain, and really detracts from the usefulness of the system, which is, obviously, intended to be portable. I don't understand why they built a product expressly for the purpose of creating liquid drinks to take out of the home with you, and made the container leaky. I would prefer a simple completely closed cover that you could remove to drink; I understand that many people prefer the sip covers, especially in their cars, but, compared to other to-go containers on the market, this one is unusually cheesy. If you are using this system to make drinks to take with you for lunch or a workout later in the day, you essentially have to spend your entire day worrying about leaks and remembering to hold your container carefully upright - which is the opposite of making things easier for you. In short, the system works well enough and is very convenient in terms of speed and ease of use. It takes only minutes to mix up a drink, and then you don't have to find a container to put it in (or have two separate containers to clean). Having two mixer jars is great for couples or for making two drinks to have with you at different times of the day. However, there are questions about the durability of the motor, and the leaky lid creates a serious hassle. The latter is particularly regrettable, because otherwise it's a great system.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is probably the best $15 I ever spent for the kitchen. I had a bigger standard blender, but never used it. Now, with this little blender, the little jar is always filled with something or in the dish drainer. It never gets a chance to be put away in the cabinet. The blender base is always on the counter - the only appliance of any sort that has that status. It's simple and it works. It makes no more than two servings, and it does a real good job with single servings. I can make one kind of smoothie or shake and my son can make his own. All of a sudden, we go to the store looking for \"smoothie fodder\" and we don't have to agree on what that is. I am buying my second mostly for the second jar and lids. It is so inexpensive that they do not sell the replacement parts.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is an amazing value for the price! I have a full-sized blender, but it was just too much for what I needed (1 serving smoothie), and was annoying to clean such a large thing afterwards... so I wanted something smaller. I LOVE the design of this blender - it's a very simple 1-button machine that allows me to throw everything in it, blend, and then just twist off and GO! The lid slides open to allow for drinking my smoothie directly out of it (so it serves a double purpose). The design of the lid is very good - it's very easy to sip the smoothie from this (it has a nicely designed drinking lip), and the size of the container is perfect for my car cup holder. After you are done with base, the cord twists and locks into a recessed area in the bottom of the blender, making cleanup even easier. The blender looks awesome just sitting on my countertop, ready to make smoothies at any time! The only thing I could possibly wish for is more power. Pros: 1) This is a perfect smoothie maker! Has been able to handle almost anything (see Cons below for more about this) I've put in there, even frozen fruit. 2) The design is just genius to me. I'm able to make a smoothie and go in 5 minutes. After blending, just twist off and go, and lid slides open to allow you to drink/sip... it's totally portable. Device itself is very small, takes up little space on your counter, and does look nice (especially since the cord is pretty much concealed at base of blender). I actually like that it only has 1 button - makes it easier for me. 3) Cleanup is a breeze. Splash some water and a little soap in there and swish around, dump out and air dry, or just let water sit/soak for a few minutes if the food is harder to get off. I've read from other reviews that the lid can become a little flimsy, so I always handwash it. Dishwashers can warp some delicate plastics sometimes... Cons: 1) As stated on some other people's reviews, there IS a burning smell if you push button for too long or if you throw something in there that it cannot handle. Always pulse this thing for maybe 20-30 seconds at a time, do NOT just keep your finger on the button for too long. This is basically just a baby blender, so it's a little more delicate than many of us are used to. 2) This little blender is not able to handle large & hard items very well - I wish it had more power. Examples of things the blender has had trouble with: big pieces of cubed ice, whole frozen strawberries. I used the crushed ice dispenser from my fridge when I need ice, and cut the whole frozen strawberries in half when I need those. If you stick something in there that it cannot handle, the blade is just going to freeze up on you (i.e. get stuck). 3) The blade is small, so it's not always as easy as \"blend & go\" - sometimes I have to pulse a couple of times and then \"help\" it by mixing the things at the top into it with a spoon so that everything is able to make it to the blade at the bottom and get blended properly. This isn't a big deal to me, although I know that the super expensive blenders that people use for smoothies, like VitaMix or BlendTec, don't require help from spoons as much as this one :) 4) This blender does not blend as well as more professional blenders. I've had a green smoothie (i.e. has spinach in it) from a pro blender and it's perfectly smooth and blended, you don't see any food particles at all, looks beautiful. With this blender, you do see the small pieces of chopped up spinach mixed in it (they ARE small, however). This doesn't bother me at all personally, although it grosses some of my co-workers out :) TIPS! 1) Because this blender is not very powerful, I've found that it works better if you put the liquid and/or soft items in FIRST and then begin to blend in the frozen items and ice. 2) Remember to pulse, do not continuously blend for more than 20-30 seconds I'd say (or you will get the burning smell!). I actually pulse for about 10-15 seconds myself (I want this thing to last me a long time!) Conclusion: Despite the cons, this VERY inexpensive blender has still been an amazing purchase for me. You definitely get more than your money's worth, in my opinion. I have owned and have used it everyday for 2 months now and it works fine as long as I remember that it isn't super powerful and might need some \"help\" sometimes. The design of the blender is amazing though and is what makes this stand out from other blenders. It makes it so easy to create a smoothie and go. I am kind of lazy but wanted to change my diet. I have a full-sized blender but it was burdensome - too much - too big - a pain to clean. This blender has made it SO easy that I'm now drinking extremely healthy smoothies everyday, full of things like spinach, veggies, fruit, yogurt, flaxseed oil, and organic raw egg yolks. I've lost 7 pounds and am FULL of energy now also. I'm so happy!! This little blender has made a large positive impact on my health. I'm sure I'll eventually get a VitaMix one day since I'm eating the smoothies so much now, but only when this one dies on me (let's see how long it lasts). UPDATE Aug 2010: Originally bought this blender May 2010. It's August 2010, and the lid finally cracked - well, I guess I got what I paid for. The crack is getting bigger and starts to leak liquid now as I blend. I've used it almost daily now for 3 months... since I know that smoothies are going to stay a part of my diet now, I am considering upgrading to a Vitamix blender. UPDATE Aug 2011: I have officially trashed this little blender and am downgrading my rating to 3 stars because it's no good for long term use. I bought another one soon after the lid cracked on the previous one (hey, at under $20 a pop, I didn't think much of it to just buy another). WELL, a couple of months after purchasing that 2nd blender, the bottom of the plastic cup cracked! Grrr... The mechanism/motor of the units worked just fine each time, it was the VERY cheaply-made plastic container/cup that makes this product a bad idea for long term use. I have purchased a Ninja Prep Pro system and although it's not a Vitamix, it's a HUGE improvement over this little blender (and the Ninja is also Consumer Reports' #2 blender right now, right behind Vitamix!)", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This blender is good for the price. You get what you pay for. I paid $15.00 for it to travel with to make smoothies. If you hold down the button too long, there is a little burning smell coming from the motor, so it would be easy to burn it out. I have just blended protein powder, milk, and bananas with this and it has worked well for me. It's better to pulse the start button than to keep it running.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I'm about to buy my 3rd one. I've got one at home, and one I take on the road with me. I'm buying a new one because the one I've had for a little over a year has finally gotten a small crack at the bottom and leaks slightly; I don't know if it's because I had stored it for a short time in sub-freezing temperatures, or just because I've used it until it cracked. Who cares? It's $12, that comes out to a buck a month. I use it anywhere from 2-10 times a week, depending on how warm it is and what I'm in the mood for. I was reading some of the other reviews complaining about several things, and I wanted to address my thoughts on those issues after having used one of these for about 2 years. Leaking around the lid: I just now filled it 3/4 full of water to test it out, since I usually make smoothies or shakes with it, and they are much too thick to leak. Yes, it will leak a bit around the slide cover of the travel lid, if you are blending thin liquids. It wasn't very bad, and if you hold your hand over the lid it won't get everywhere. All I can think of is that some of the reviewers aren't snapping the lid on completely and it's leaking around it. I've never had a smoothie leak through or around the lid. Not blending anything solid/only blending stuff on the bottom. People, if your mixture is too thick, it can't get down to the bottom to blend up correctly. A large kitchen blender will blend thicker stuff because (a) it's got a more powerful motor, and (b) a much larger blending container. When you are using this, it's better to put the liquids in first, and then the harder stuff up top; otherwise, you are going to have a very thick mixture on the bottom that can't rotate up and let the thinner stuff down. This isn't a design defect, it's just physics and the way things are. When I make smoothies, I put the ice in last, and it grinds up large chunks of ice very smoothly. If it's still a bit too thick to blend up, I add a bit more milk or juice or whatever so it will work properly. Once it gets going, it has a nice whirlpool effect and everything gets blended well. As far as the smoking motors, I have had no problem with either of mine. You can smell the motor bushings when you use it, but it's the same smell you get from every electric motor, just ask anyone who owned a model train as a kid. I only blend for less than 20 secs at a time, so maybe that's why I have never burned the motor up. You can't leave it going continuously like you might a large kitchen blender. People, this is a one serving blender, and for $12, you get more than what you pay for. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but not for even twice the price of this one; if I have to buy a new one every year, I can live with that. You can't compare it to a full sized kitchen blender and expect it to do everything the big one does. I thought about taking one star from it for a couple of things I would recommend changing about it (I think a blending lid would be a good idea, and it would make it easier to clean if you could separate the blades from the bottom), but in the end I decided that I couldn't expect those things from, once again, a $12 blender. In conclusion, it does what it professes to do (makes smoothies and shakes), does it very well if used properly, and does it for what I consider to be a bargain price. That should be the gold standard for 5 stars, in my humble opinion.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "[Update: Motor burned out in 5th month, but I may have become unrealistic in my expectations of the little machine, bullying it more than necessary. It easily outlasted a Blender Express, and unlike the bad design of the Blender Express, the elegant simplicity of this Hamilton Beach insures not only much quicker but spill-free, dripless smoothies. I've ordered another. Lessons learned: Make sure liquid gets to the bottom along with the ice; turn it off at first sign of heat or electric odor; keep a close watch on the 25c-piece-sized lid.] If you're an experienced and regular smoothie maker, you know already that anything over a year's use from a non-professional machine is a bonus. I recently returned a lightweight Blender Express (by Back to the Basics) that failed after a single use! (The banana was too much for it.) This Hamilton Beach is the smallest, lightest blender I've seen yet, but it promises to perform for a while at least. Ingeniously, the makers have avoided any reference to ice cubes in either the instruction manual or recipes (I get the point, though I still insist on using them). Also, there is no \"on\" switch; instead, the unit has only a \"pulse\" switch, thereby insuring that your hands must remain on the unit, preventing it from dancing off the counter and insuring that the motor gets stopped the instant excessive resistance is met. For under twenty bucks and six months' use, you can count this one a decent value--though keep those smoothies small and simple. And if you plan to take the container \"on the road,\" be extra careful about misplacing the quarter-sized center lid (mine disappeared faster than a quarter).", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I was looking for an inexpensive small personal blender that was powerful, easy to use, and could blend a perfect smoothie. I did a lot of research and looked into about a dozen other brands including the famed \"Magic Bullet\". What I found out was that not all personal blenders are made equal. The \"Magic Bullet\" didn't get very good reviews even though it is by far the most popular. After all my intense research, I settled on this one... The Hamilton Beach Single Serve Blender. Here's the scoop on what makes this surprising blender the \"cream of the crop\" :) Pros: -Simple and easy to use -Easy to Clean -Powerful enough to chop frozen fruits (and probably ice too) -Pulse button allows you more control because you can start or stop it. -Seems very sturdy and only has 3 parts to it. (lid, glass, and base) -This thing is freaking cheap... got mine for $15. -Blends Smoothies perfectly with no unchopped pieces of fruit. -Power cord can be tucked in and wrapped around bottom of base for storage. Cons: -Emits a slight 'burnt oil' odor while it is in operation... but it's not as bad as it sounds. -The Lid seems kind of flimsy. Conclusion: At $15 this little blender is not only a bargain, it gets the job done and does it well! In fact, it works just as well as my friend's personal blender which costs more than twice the amount I spent on this one. The elegance and simplicity of the design is also to be admired. The plastic blending container also doubles as a travel mug and the Lid to it doubles as a sipping lid when used as a travel mug. It's a nice surprise to see a product in which you can see that they put a lot of thought into it's design. It's positive aspects greatly outshine the few negatives... especially when considering the price. So if you need an amazing blender but you're on a budget, pick this one up and never look back! By the way, this thing is also available elsewhere... like \"Wally World\" and \"Target\" ...and at the same low price :)", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "OK - I don't usually write reviews, but I do read a ton of them and yes, some of them sound like they are written by manufacturers of the product while others sound like they may be from the competition. If you weed through enough of them though, you can basically get the down and dirty of what the product can and can't do. I am here to tell you what I found out. I read a lot of reviews on numerous websites about this little product after seeing the infomercial on it. I never did the MagicBullet, but heard good things about it from some friends who owned one. After hitting the juice craze recently, I became quickly frustrated with the tossing out of all that good pulp which I was sure was being wasted and could be good nutrients for the body, just being tossed out. Prep time on top of that and the clean up was becoming quickly a chore. I am convinced on the benefits of fruits and veggies and to date have lost more than 50lbs since Jan incorporating juicing into my Weight Watchers routine. OK - so I read a lot of reviews - when it came right down to it - the only real gripe I saw that people were having was this \"leak\" issue. For those that say this is just a blender - I would beg to differ - my fancy Cuisinart blender doesn't pulverize FLAX seeds and coffee beans the way this thing does. Just try putting some small flax seeds in your blender with some fruit and tell me you get the smooth consistency that this little work horse puts out. OK - so it is more than a blender - now the overall: Power: no problem - scared me a bit the first time I pushed down on it with it's force, but was nice to know it does sound powerful. I have put carrots, ice, apples and FLAX seeds all at once in here and it comes out smooth as silk - no problem. Remember - this is not a \"JUICER\" this makes JUICE SMOOTHIES with PULP - Clean Up: A snap....a breeze - sooooooo much easier than my juicer. Love it. I can go into the kitchen, make a smoothie, clean up and be out in about 5 minutes. Juicing took 10-15 minutes of prep time alone, then another 5 minutes or so of cleanup. Took half my lunch hour to make a juice.... Recipes: There are lots of good recipes and ideas in the book that came with it - don't think I got the extras they talk about on the TV which is sad - but I am sure I can dig those up on line somewhere. Leak Issue: OK - Here is the deal....for all you people who cannot read the instructions in the manual that comes with the unit. DO NOT OVERFILL - SCREW BASE ON SECURELY. If you didn't understand that, then here let me state it this way - HEY! SCREW THE BASE ON TIGHT AND DON'T PUT TOO MUCH STUFF IN IT. Still don't understand - how about this - DO NOT FILL ABOVE THE LINE MARKED ON THE CONTAINER WHICH STATES - MAX FILL LINE I don't know how much clearer I can be without demoralizing someone at this point. It's simple folks - you need to leave enough room (airspace) in the container to allow blending to occur. If there is not airspace - liquid will push out at any seam it finds - consequently - it will leak. Follow the instructions, do not overfill and screw the base on securely and it will work beautifully. Here is another tip - because I have gone a little over on the fill once or twice. If while blending you keep an eye on the base where it meets the clear plastic container - you can see the leak working its way up through the threads of the base. If you see this happening, stop the unit and take some out and re-blend. Simple. Best practice is though to NOT OVERFILL - DO NOT FILL ABOUT MAX FILL LINE - TIGHTEN BASE SECURELY. Got it???? Price: I purchased mine at Target for $99 as most customers were complaining about the leak issue and if I had to return it, better to do it at the store where I bought it. Most times, I would go through Amazon, but this one had me thinking with all the banter about the darn leak issue, so I played it safe. I hear they sell them at some Bed Bath and Beyond's too if you are looking locally. And yes, far better than dropping hundreds on a Vitamix or Blendtec. Comparisons to other: I did look at the Ninja Pulse unit as well. I was on the fence right up till I went to the store on which one I was going to get. I looked at both of the displays and found the Nutribullet was far beefier than the Ninja. The Ninja was light and \"plasticky\" and took up a little more space than the Bullet. And then here was the kicker for me. I looked down and there were no Nutribullet's on the shelf and 4 or 5 Ninjas. So - I was off to the next Target across town only to find they were sold out there as well. I asked the lady in the department when they expected more and she said - \"We cannot keep them in stock, they sell out very quickly\". OK - so that cinched the deal with me with the decision on which one to get. I then went to Target's online website, looked it up there and did a \"Stock Check\" for stores in my area - All were sold out except one which was about 30 miles away - so I made the trek up and go there to find ONE last unit on the shelf - MINE!!! I spoke to my sister in Denver and she was looking for one out there and found the same problem - sold out all over Denver, but found hers at BB&Beyond. When checking out the lady at the register said she was amazed at how many of these were selling recently. So ...this is a hot item folks....you may have to look around to find it in your town. Check the Target site for \"Locate Locally\"...it will save you some time - or just buy it on line from Amazon. You shouldn't need to return it because it doesn't leak if your remember to NOT FILL ABOVE MAX FILL LINE and TIGHTEN BASE SECURELY. Overall Opinion: Have had this unit about a week and have done several dozen drinks with it so far and have absolutely no complaints - works great, is powerful and does not leak if your remember to NOT OVERFILL and NOT FILL ABOVE MAX FILL LINE.....lol. I love having my pulp back - - - Happy Smoothing Everyone!!! P.S. My apologies to those who may be offended by my over stating the \"common sense\" aspect of the proper usage of this product. I realize \"common sense\" has lost its way in many areas of our society these days and when people cannot read the instruction manual which clearly says \"Read First Before Using\" then I start to wonder if maybe \"literacy\" is more the issue than \"common sense\". Either way - if you are reading this and feel offended by my comments about you not being able to understand what it means to NOT FILL ABOVE MAX FILL LINE or TIGHTEN BASE SECURELY, then I am sorry.....for you. [Update:] Nov 3, 2012 - Just checking in after seeing the last reply to my post and thought I would post an update here. First let me say I am very surprised at all the replies to my post, glad to see I am not the only one who thinks out things sensibly still. So, with the help of the NB and Weight Watchers, I am down 102 lbs since last January 1 in my quest to lose 165 by mid summer 2013. Since purchasing the NB in June, I have dropped about 40 additional lbs. (Averaging about 10lbs per month). I contribute much of the success to the NB and all the good things I can put in there and the benefits of having all of the stuff back in my drink rather than tossing it from using my old Juiceman Juicer. The NB itself is still working quite well, I have had no problems, 1 or 2 minor leaks (teaspoon or less), but it was due to my own errors of packing in a little too much or on a sleepy morning not tightening it quite tight enough. All in all, so very happy with the unit still and still highly recommend. Good luck everyone and I hope you can enjoy this little gem of an appliance as much as I have. - DH [Update:} Nov 21, 2013 - OK folks, time for me to chime in on this \"rust and blade issue\". I have been meaning to do this for awhile, but it seems people are really freakin on this rust and which blades to be looking for etc. I see some have posted some pictures of the newer style base. I am going to add mine with comments in red showing you difference between old and new styles. I find it very hard to believe this is rust in these other pictures - are you all not drying your unit after you wash it and then just leaving it in the cabinet for 3 or 4 months before taking it to use again and then NOT washing it before you use it? I mean really....I take glasses out of the cabinet which we use each year at Christmas time and I ALWAYS wash them cause I don't like the taste of dust. If I looked and saw rust on blades I think I would either wash the heck out of it or not use it at all. I somehow think this might be fruit sedament which has not been cleaned off or washed and then let to sit. There could not possibly be grease inside this thing, maybe some light oil on the bearings...if it even uses bearings. I don't know what to tell you....I wash mine because I like clean utensils before I used them, sorry....personal preference. OK, so yes as I mentioned in a reply to someone - I did have a loud sound like grinding almost, start about a year after I had it and I called customer service and for the price of shipping and handling ($6 I think) they sent me a new base. Immediately I saw the differences in blade configuration and in construction. Then when I tried it - wow - much much quieter....but I think mine was really getting louder over time. SO yes, the new blade extractor base is far \"beefier\" in construction and seems to be much quieter than the original ever was and also just seems \"tighter\". Yes!! This is the same original unit I bought and it is still working fabulously and I use it ....8-10 times a week and my wife also uses it. I have been traveling a lot for work the last couple months so my regiment has been slightly adjusted on my weight loss program. So bottom line on this update - I still love it, new base is best, make sure you get one with new base. And for all the nice commenting folks congratulating me on my weight loss - here's an update. I am down it total 140 pounds. I did not make my goal of 220 by my 50th, but I have not put back on any...well a few here and there, but then lost them again...up and down a bit, but not focusing on my WW meetings as much and etc etc.... but I still feel great and much more active, swimming and working out. I contribute the success to WW and the NB....and of course \"discipline\". Hope this helps - Check out the new pics I am adding now. - DH", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I had not seen the infomercial when I purchased this. I was looking for a powerful smoothie maker after my smoothie blender died. The base is MUCH heavier/substantial and well made than the Magic Bullet. It also looks more expensive/nice. I know this because I was at Target examining them both closely. The 600 watts of power has been great to tear through kale, chard, frozen berries, almonds, chia seeds. I love the consistency of the smoothie when I am done. it is not a complete liquid, but really well blended. I love that you keep the nutrition of the pulp. It is not like my first old juicer that left the pulp out of the juice, but also the nutrition. It was a NIGHTMARE to clean. Then I bought the smoothie blender that is now kaput! The Nutri Bullet literally rinses clean in ten seconds. Obviously rinse it right after you are done using it. My daughter won't touch anything green and we put kale, chard, broccoli and fruit,berries to make it NOT green and she likes it. Honestly we are NOT a family that likes kale, chard, broccoli, prunes, but feel so much better now that we are ingesting them. It took about two weeks for me to notice a difference and feel better. My husband and I have been having two a day and I have lost 4 lbs in 18 days without trying. They just keep you full and satisfied. It has taken the edge off my sweet tooth. They will keep you \"regular.\" I don't know why they don't just give you two large smoothie cups. We only use the big size. Do not fill past the max line with fruit or water. It will leak out of the seal and down into the blender and out the bottom. There is no way to clean out where the smoothie leaks through. We overcrammed it the first few times and learned our lesson. It doesn't \"liquify\" or make it as smooth as when you use less. Also you save a fortune when buying greens and frozen fruit from the big box stores. The smoothie tastes SO much better really cold. Our first green smoothie was not a success because it was warm! I would recommend defrosting the frozen fruit just slightly. It just blends it up better. (I think part of the problem were the frozen strawberries. They were huge and rock solid/hard to \"liquify\" completely.) We had such a big container of spinach/greens we ended up freezing it and it works/tastes great! My daughter complained it wasn't sweet enough, we tried honey, had to use too much, stevia, just didn't taste that great and then read about the health benefits of prunes. We tried 2-3 per big smoothie, enough for two glasses and it is perfect. A little sweetness and no prune taste at all. We also purchased the almonds, chia seeds and prunes at a huge savings from the big box store. I highly recommend this Nutri-Bullet. It takes me about two-three minutes to make a smoothie and clean up. (I blend it for about thirty seconds.) We are trying/experimenting with foods we would NEVER eat. The directions and nutrition booklets are great to read through for health/diet info. I just love that this Bullet takes up less than half the space of my dead smoothie blender and 1/10 the space of my monster sized juicer that is going on Craigslist!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Love to read reviews but rarely do I take the time to write them. From the moment I saw the NutriBullet on TV, I was on a mission to find one locally. Target $99, $105 included tax. Mine came with the Quick Start booklet, the User guide and Recipe booklet, as well as all the mixing/drinking cups, lids, rims, etc. One reviewer mentioned how eating salads was becoming monotonous/bunny food. Agree. Even though I dressed them up with tilapia, salmon, etc., it still just got old. Now, on to my REVIEW: I started with the Phase I Toxin Cleansing Blast. I had one on Tuesday, May 1. OMGosh it was so good and was liquefied, no gritty bits, so no worries there. Day two, I had two of the same (Toxin Cleansing Blast) drinks. Both nights I saturated my sheets with sweat (TMI?). I lost three pounds but chalked it up to water loss. The remaining of the week I have been drinking three NutriBlasts a day, alternating between the Vita-Berry and Nutty Nectar blasts as I have still not used up all of my spinach. Today (Tuesday, May 8) has been one week and I am down 9.5 lbs. Still drinking water in between, but what is nice is besides all the nutrients via vegetables, fruits, etc., it is blended with water, so you get plenty of what your body needs and craves. Now, for you nay-sayers that will say \"as soon as you start eating, the weight will come back on\", you are probably right, and I plan to start incorporating food back into my plan. Also, nowhere does the NutriBlast booklet tell you NOT to eat solid foods in week one or at anytime, but I don't feel hungry. NutriBlasts are very filling, maybe the aeration helps. The only other thing I do is add Flax Seed to my Blasts since I had a complimentary jar of it from GNC and didn't know what to do with it until I saw the recipe booklet. I was going to wait a month to see if this purchase was worth posting a review, but I am so thrilled that if this continues I will add to my post in one month. My Doctor suggested I lose 20 lbs as menopause and weight gain had snuck up on me so I hope I have finally found something to help out with that. The three flavored Blasts I mentioned above are delish. I have not tried Kale or Collard Greens yet as a base. Now that kind of scares me, but the spinach as a base is awesome. Oh, and besides my excitement of weight loss....the NutriBullet is compact enought to sit on your counter. Has awesome power and looks so nice out of the box, you almost don't want to use it. However, it cleans right up with a good hot water rinsing and a paper towel dries it off nicely. I have not yet put mine in a dishwasher (so far, not necessary). Hope this helps. UPDATE June 12: A little late on my update. Busy with graduations, etc. Today I am down an additional eight lbs. I did go back on my salads, fish, broccoli/asparagus, etc. meals once a day. Still doing my nutriblasts at least once a day, maybe twice, depending on how hungry I feel. Still using Flax seed in the Blasts. On to the Nutribullet itself....I absolutely love this item and for the price it can't be beat. Rarely do I use the Recipe book anymore. I toss in whatever fruits I have. Melon, grapes, pears, strawberries, apples, a banana (always)...whatever you have works. I am still using spinach as a base. I may not be as adventurous as others, I have not made a pure veggie blast nor have I tried Kale or Collards. Anyway, all is good with my NutriBullet, no leaks, no problems whatsoever. For me, it does what is advertised.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I loved the NutriBullet when I got it, I used it every day. I purchased mine directly from their website. I even posted on my blog how awesome it was and recommended it to others. After having it about a month it sprung a leak, I had smoothie all over my counter and dripping down through the power base. I unplugged it and sent an email to customer service. I received no answer from them after three days so I tried to call them, after wading through a sea of voice prompts I finally received a message that said their customer service queue was full and to call back later - wow, no answer to email and they won't even take my calls. After about 5 days I received an email saying they'd replace the unit and even waive shipping since it was less than a month old. Cool, that worked for me, problem solved... or so I thought. When I replied back to thank them for the replacement I received another reply asking me a bunch of questions about what I was doing when it broke. Each time I replied to one of their emails it took at least two days to get a reply. They would ask me something and I'd answer, then I'd get a reply asking the same thing a different way. It was almost as if they were intentionally stalling to keep from replacing my NutriBullet. I tried calling again and this time the phone would ring twice and go to a fast busy signal, I tried several times over the course of a day and then emailed again. After a few more days of trying I was able to leave a voice mail and was told they'd call me back. Finally I received a call saying they were sending my replacement out and they'd just need a credit card to charge the shipping to even though I was told I wouldn't be charged for shipping... since they stalled for two weeks now I was past my 30 days but eventually did get it shipped without paying. That was over 2 weeks ago and I was told I would receive my replacement in 7-10 days. It's been over a month since I had the problem and first contacted them. I've made half a dozen phone calls and traded a dozen emails with them and still don't have a replacement. If you decide to get a NutriBullet just be aware that if it breaks and you don't have a local retail store that will swap it out for you that you are in for one of the most frustrating experiences you've ever had. I still don't know when I'll get my replacement and most definitely wouldn't recommend others to buy one. Stupid NutriBullet. **UPDATE:** On 10/17/12... after 21 emails, 4 phone calls and 5 weeks I received my replacement. I've used it a few times but to be honest after the ordeal to get it replaced I'm a bit burnt out on it. I'll definitely not purchase anything from this company again.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I don't have much to add to the glowing reviews of this product. I love mine and have been telling anyone who will listen that they should buy one. I have noticed things about it that may help you enjoy it as much as most people do and avoid the negative experiences some have had. First: The max fill line. The max fill line is in reference to the amount of WATER that you put in. Your fruits and veggies and whatever else can be piled way above that, all the way to the tip top. I do that twice a day, every day with no problem. It will not leak if you screw the blade on securely and keep the water at or below the max fill line. When you do get your ingredients loaded up and and your water added up to the max fill line and your blade securely screwed on, give the cup a vigorous shake. If it doesn't leak then, it isn't going to leak when you make your blast. Unless: I had my first ever leak the other day and it prompted me to write these tips. I made a smoothie of two handfuls of kale, some grapes and 4 chunks each of watermelon, canteloupe, honeydew melon and pineapple. Added water to the max line, tightened the blade on, gave a vigorous shake, no problem. Started making my blast and guess what: leakage. What happened?? It was the ingredients. All of that melon, pineapple and grapes? All of those fruits contain a great deal of WATER. So even though I stopped at the max line, I had too much water in the bullet once I started blending. I now know how and why the bullet leaks and what to look for. Be aware of these things and you'll be fine. First, when you start blending, the nutribullet makes noise but it should not sound rough. If it sounds rough, stop. What is happening there is there is too much volume in the cup. You can see this by looking at the top during blending. Is there a clearly formed vortex (for lack of a better word)? If there isn't, and you hear/feel that roughness it's because there is too much liquid volume. That causes a downward pressure that does two things. It makes it harder for the motor to turn the blade (the roughness) and the pressure starts looking for the only place it can escape (the leaking). Simply stop, pour out a bit of the contents to give the bullet room to blend and you'll be golden. You will also get drinks that are much smoother. Also, I never run the bullet for more than about 30 seconds. There really isn't a need to. Especially under the type of load that would lead to leaking. I can see how that would damage one of these quickly. With some awareness and care I think the unit can last for a duration commensurate with it's price tag. I hope this helps. Enjoy your nutribullet! **UPDATE 06/20/2013** So my nutribullet is still going strong. I started doing a dring for breakfast and then blending up a second one to take for lunch, then eating as healthy a dinner as possible. Easily lost 20 pounds in three weeks doing that. make no mistake, the nutribullet didn't do that, the food did, but the nutribullet helps make it easy. I go to the store and buy a huge fruit tray of pineapple chunks, grapes, sliced apples, cantaloupe, watermelon, or whatever. I also grab a bag of kale or baby spinach. I make my drinks very green heavy. A few handfuls of the greens, a few chunks of each of the fruits in the fruit tray and that's it. Maybe some flax seed. Don't be scared to pack the cup pretty full, just keep the liquid below the line and pour it in AFTER you have packed everything in. The only performance issue I've ever had was with some huge frozen strawberries I had. The nutribullet was obviously having a hard time with them. That brings me to another point. I believe it's up to the user to mitigate and help the device last as long as possible. If you hear it struggling with something you are doing, stop. And don't do it again. No matter what another reviewer or the infomercial says. Take care of it, be smart about using it, and it will last.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "My Husband has always loved to juice. For him the more earthy tasting the better but hated wasting the pulp. So he absolutely loved the concept. We have had no leaking or problems with the motor. It blends beautiful. However, the quality of the cups leave a lot to be desired. Within two weeks of daily usage both small cups were broken. One of the small plastic protrusions (There are three) broke off leaving them useless to the machine. Since I had registered my product with them I contacted the company and offered to send them back to them for replacements. I was promptly was reassured that \"We have a 100% satisfaction guarantee and they would replace them \"FREE OF CHARGE\". Now for the kicker, even though it was registered with them they demanded the original receipt, OK, Found that. Then they said I had to pay handling charges that would cost more for the 2 small cups alone than what I could order a complete set from there website that included 1-small Cup, 1- Large cup, 1- Extractor blade and one Handel. When I complained \"David Victor\" never returned my e-mails and it has now been 3 weeks. Bottom Line, buy a warrantee external to the company or get from a big box so you can frequently return for new replacements, Nutribullets business model a \"soak them as you can\" policy. What a shame, a pretty good product is tainted by a company run like this one.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Ok people, I am very analytical. So when I saw an infomercial about this, I dove deep into each health claim it made. Further, I dug into all the Amazon reviews about the actual feedback of users. I will detail my concerns before my purchase, and 1 month after using it ~2 times per day. So roughly 60 uses. \"it sounds like a military jet engine when it is running\" -> Not so. It sounds as loud as loud as any blender I have ever used. Does not come close to the sound of a jet engine. \"the plastic cup broke when screwing on tightly\" -> Not yet. I have tightened the lid tight enough to prevent leakage, and tight enough that my wife cannot open it. There is a rubber ring that gets compressed to prevent leakage and probably absorbs some force when tightening. Would say i put it pretty tight, and it has not broken. \"it smells like grease or electronics burning when using\" -> Yes. The first use it did smell like electronics smoking. As a guy, i am not super sensitive to smells. That said, it was noticeable, but not very strong. It dissipated over the course of a few uses. I would imagine there is some lubricants that were burring off initially. No smells at this point. I hope this helps. Also, a note on my health/weight loss. I drink a big one at b-fast, eat like crap at lunch (company buys lunch every day), and big one for dinner. I am down 15lbs, and have ALOT of energy in AM and PM. I still get food comma after lunch - but i eat like crap so that is to be expected. Take care.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I was excited to buy this product when I saw the infomercial, as I've been wanting to start either juicing or making green smoothies. I decided on a smoothie maker, because a good juicer is much more expensive and involves a lot more cleanup. I received it about a week ago, and I'm returning it. I tested it against the Oster BLSTCC-BFP 6-Cup Glass Jar 12-Speed Blender Plus 3-Cup Food Processor, Black that I've had for years, and the Nutribullet failed miserably: 1) Much of it is made out of plastic, even parts of the power base! The user guide says to be sure not to use it for more than 60 seconds because it can permanently damage the motor. If it overheats and the motor stops working, you have to unplug it and let it cool down for an hour. When I used it for only 30 seconds, I noticed a strong burning plastic smell, even though everything I put in it was soft or liquid, with the exception of 3 ice cubes. I wasn't sure it would make it and was afraid it would burn out. My blender has an all metal drive, with a glass jar. I've had it for years and use it all the time. Many times, I've had it blending for over 2 minutes at a time, with no problem at all. 2) The Nutribullet is supposed to be such a cinch to clean, but it's not any easier than my trusty blender (in case you're wondering: no, I do not work for Oster!). In fact, I'd say my blender is easier because it doesn't leak, can withstand high temperatures, I've cleaned it in the dishwasher countless times, and it looks and works like I bought it yesterday. Plus, the power base is way easier to clean - doesn't have all the Nutribullet's plastic nooks and crannies that are nearly impossible to get into to clean. 2) The Nutribullet leaks too easily. You have to screw the lid/blade on top of the cup, then turn it upside down and insert it into the base where the motor is. If you don't screw it on just right, it will leak. This is not an ever an issue with a regular blender. 3) It comes with all sorts of accessories, so you think you're getting a great deal for the money, but you're really not. It comes with 1 tall cup, 2 short cups, lids, handles, etc. I don't use or need the handle. I don't need or use the lids. I don't need or use the 2 short cups - they're an absolute waste, unless you're making a smoothie that's sized for a baby. It's a waste of plastic and a storage nightmare. 4)I tested it against my blender. I use the exact same ingredients, at the same time: ice, blackberries, banana, almond milk, protein powder, sesame seeds, and cold water. They both blended well, had fairly the same consistency. Neither product was able to \"pulverize\" the blackberry seeds (which the Nutribullet claims to do, and I quote, straight from their website: \"the NutriBullet comes with the all-new Extractor Blade that emulsifies even the toughest of ingredients including seeds, nuts and stems.\" Well, it most certainly does NO such thing. The only significant difference was that the smoothie from the Nutribullet was cool, bordering on tepid, while the smoothie from my blender was ICE COLD. This was the straw that broke the camel's back. #1, I like my smoothies ice cold. #2, it just goes to show that the Nutribullet so easily overheats, while my blender stays cool as a cucumber. Now, here is the kicker: My blender is $49.99 AND comes with a food processor The Nutribullet is $119.94 It's a no-brainer. By the way, like most of you, I'm a busy person. I rarely take an hour to write a product review, unless I strongly feel that I'm doing a public service by doing so. This is one of those times. You can spend far less money and get a far superior product.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "First, I want to say that I was the owner of an omega juicer, which was great, except that when juicing, you get the pulp separated from the juice and so you lose all of that fiber. When i saw this infomercial, it intrigued me, because I like my children (2,4 & 9) to get their veggies in, but they will not just eat them plain, usually. So, I cook things with broccoli in it, I find other ways to sneak in their veggies, but when I bought my omega juicer, I was hoping for something more. It was a great juicer, but again, the fiber issue and the bulkiness and hassle of cleanup is what kept it in my cupboard and not using it. I was very skeptical about the nutribullet and my husband refused, at first, to let me purchase it, because he said to me \"you've been watching infomercials again, haven't you?\" lol anyway, I knew when i tried greens in my regular blender, the greens would get stuck on the blade and it just never worked, so when i saw you could use greens in the nutribullet, I immediately wanted one. I sold my omega juicer that i paid 229 dollars on craigslist for 150. Then, i convinced my husband to let me purchase this. He caved. I went to walmart and picked one up for 99 dollars and the first time I tried it, my husband was actually impressed! A week later, he's using it by himself while I'm sleeping for breakfast! We tried spinach, , carrots, kale, banana, orange, pineapple, apple, blueberries, grapes and strawberries, ice and flax seed whole. At first i kept wondering why they had such little flavor, but then i figured out it was becuase of the water. Think about it like this - if you juice a pineapple, and add water to it, you are getting watered down flavor. So, i tried doing half juice, half water and WOW!! the taste improved significantly. The best part about it, is that my kids LOVE IT!!! When i had my juicer, they did not like the green juices I would make, I'd have to mix it with regular juice to get them to drink it down. They beg me to make nutriblasts! Now, after all the raving I've done, I WILL say a few things that kind of concerns me. One, it leaked a few drops twice so far. I just take a napkin and I wipe it up right away, and it's not anything more than a few drops, so for now, I'm assuming it was my fault for not screwing on the blade tight enough. (i never overfill above MAX line, so i know it's not that) Two - I am scared to run it for too long because it's my baby and I don't want to mess the motor up! lol Three- It does not pulverize the flax seed as good as i thought it would and there are tiny peices of skin from some fruits, but definitely so small that it doesn't even matter. I am SHOCKED at how this thing turns a peice of lettuce into liquid. There are no chunks whatsoever and any skin or seed that you can see are smaller than the size of a dot you'd make on a piece of paper with crayon. You can't even taste it. Even with my juicer, i'd get bigger chunks/thicker product than the nutribullet!! No complaints from the kids or hubby about it. We are LOVING this thing! right now it's on amazon for 159. That is too much money, in my opinion. Try walmart or bed bath and beyond for 99. and make sure to fill out your warranty card online, then you get an extra 3 month warranty! We've been using it daily for well over a week now and it really is a fantastic product. It makes me full enough to not eat ( i could stand to lose a lot of lbs) and so that is one thing I am really digging about it. And we all know fiber is important in our diets, which is something the nutriblasts offers that my expensive juicer can not. Great products, if my kids are begging for it like it's a treat, then I would most certainly recommend this!! I've consumed more greens in the past week using my nutriblast than I have in the past year :) I'm sold. Definitely consider this gadget for your home!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I purchased a NutriBullet on February 3, 2013 through Home Shopping Network. After using the NutriBullet 5-6 times, it stopped working. I called the customer service number for NutriBullet and explained the issue. The customer service representative asked me to troubleshoot with him over the phone, which I did. Following the troubleshooting, which took about 40 minutes, the NutriBullet did work again. The customer service representative then ask me if I would like to purchased a new blade at a discounted price. I agreed and purchased the new blade. The NutriBullet was still under the original warranty at the time, however I went ahead purchased an extended warranty also. After a week of not using the NutriBullet, I tried to make a shake and again, it did not work. I did the exact same thing the customer service representative had me do during the previous troubleshooting call and it did finally work. I then called NutriBullet to ask them to please send me a new because I do not think I should have to troubleshoot to get it to work every time I want to use it. They have refused and I'm frustrated. I now own a product which I paid over $100.00 for plus purchased extened warranty on and Nutri Bullet refuses to replace it.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Purchased this coffee maker at local retailer after trying but returning a KitchenAid with thermal carafe. The Mr Coffee is 1/2 the price and twice the function. The optional thermal carafe can be substituted for the glass carafe and the machine automatically detects the carafe and adjusts by turning the hot plate on (glass) or off (thermal. Has all the functions of the best coffee makers. Makes great coffee at a temperature that is hot enough to make the coffee taste good without being so hot that it burns the coffee. I have had some issues with Mr Coffee designs in other older machines but this machine seems to be well designed. As an example, the water spout that delivers hot water to the coffee grounds is automatically placed over the coffee when the cover is closed. (You must move the spout to remove the coffee grounds basket and this feature ensures that it is always placed back at the proper location. The option of glass for 12 cups or thermal for 8 cups of coffee allows great flexibility. I highly recommend this coffee maker.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Nothing worse than a good sounding review wasting your time by the \"Cons\" of the Product. So out with it. Cons: Only \"One\" noticeable thing, pouring coffee into cup, with pot lid down/closed causes dripping. Simply lift lid a little when pouring to solve. No Biggy... Otherwise, I'm satisfied with it. I had very little to no noticeable problem with \"Plastic\" taste tainting the coffee even on the first brew. Note: Mine did have a small \"dent\" in the chrome faceplate. Barely nothing to make a fuss about or drop the rating for. Hardly noticeable... No Leaks from coffee maker itself! Buttons work really well. Lights are bright and colorful. Coffee Pot fits in and pulls out of station with no troubles. Handle and lid are good. Controls are simple. Water drip ARM automatically repositions when filling lid is closed. Filling the water reservoir takes a little AIM and Precision, but nothing collegiate. Uses standard small paper filters. I use a permanent filter myself. Regular brew or strong brew with the push of a button. Of course HOT coffee with automatic shutoff after 2 hours(beeps when it shuts off) 3 Beeps when coffee is ready - I like that! All around it's a good coffee maker so far after like 8 uses. Simple effective coffee maker. Nothing to worry about or wonder about? Does what it's supposed to do. That is, brand new it does what it's supposed to do. Nice and solid!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "After using this Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT coffeemaker for a week, I thought I would attempt to address some of the complaints that other reviewers had on this coffeemaker. Some of the complaints are valid, others, well, it seems like they're describing a different unit altogether, or at the very least a defective one or a different production run than mine. Here we go: 1. Coffee overflowing out of the basket and into the reservoir and out to the countertop: I did not experience this. This could theoretically happen if one were to accidentally use 2 paper filters, which could reduce the rate of coffee going through the basket, which would then create an overflow situation. This scenario would not be limited to this coffeemaker, then. Overflow could also happen if one were to accidentally allow grounds to go into or remain in the plastic basket, which could clog it. Again, not particular to this coffeemaker. Could also happen if the carafe were incorrectly placed in the coffeemaker: not likely at all (see below). 2. Length of brew time too long: No reviewers stated how many minutes per batch, or how many cups and minutes per batch. This unit seemed to take a reasonable amount of time - the same amount of time that my Cuisinart maker takes. 3. Brewed coffee not hot enough: Using a good candy thermometer, I measured the temperature of a brewed pot of coffee (while in its glass carafe) immediately after brewing: 175 degrees. Scalding hot. Temperature dropped to 155 degrees within 5 minutes. Suggestion: to keep your coffee hot, move coffee to a hot-charged, insulated carafe immediately after brewing. 4. Plastic smell while brewing, plastic taste of brewed coffee: I definitely got the strong plastic smell with the first couple of water-only \"prep\" no-coffee brew cycles, and a bit less with the first few coffee cycles. This smell is no longer present after 6 days of use. Plastic taste: I did notice a slight plastic aftertaste with the first few coffee batches, but no longer. I suppose I may have gotten used to it, or it is no longer happening, or a combination of both. I think that it is the latter case. 5. Coffee leaks from basket onto the warming plate while using \"pause and serve\" feature (sneaking a cup of coffee during brewing cycle): I saw two or three drops of coffee go onto the warming plate: not too bad. Quick swipe with a damp paper towel keeps the plate clean. Not a defect. 6. Warming plate not hot enough, no temperature setting for plate: I do not use the warming plate - my coffee goes directly from the pot to an insulated carafe right after brewing. Applied post-brewed heat is the enemy of brewed coffee. The longer you keep your brewed coffee on *any* warming plate - regardless of temperature - the worse it will taste. 7. Correct carafe placement onto warming plate is difficult and likely to cause basket overflow: Despite my best, repeated efforts, I could not *incorrectly* place the pot onto the plate. The pot placed itself into its home 100 percent of the time. The only way I could get it to *not* place itself correctly was to barely balance it on the front edge of the maker, which was difficult in itself. 8. LCD Clock display not illuminated: True. A definite shortcoming of this unit, especially considering this is a programmable unit. A missed necessity. 9. Condensation on clock and buttons on front operating panel: True. Could have long-term reliability consequences. 10. Water spout not positioned properly over grounds: Impossible! The closure of the unit's lid forces (rotates) the spout into the correct position - that is of course unless one does not close the lid. 11. Filter paper collapse and fold-over onto grounds in basket, causing clog and overspill: It could happen, since I have experienced this with other drip makers. Not particular to this unit, then. 12. 2 hours post-brew auto-shutoff - too soon?: Nope. Coffee cooking for 2 hours on a warming plate would taste horrible. Want hot coffee two hours later? Move it from the pot to an insulated carafe directly after completion of brewing cycle. I would actually prefer that there were no warming unit on this machine. 13. Power cord length too short: It measures exactly 24 inches from the back middle of the unit to the male power plug. Dealbreaker? Not for many, I'm guessing. 14. Water filter placement onto top of brewing basket is difficult: Agreed. Must be done carefully. I chose to not use the filter at all, since I use purified water already. Plus, by not using the water filter, it's one more step I don't need to perform. Hot water seems to distribute nicely onto grounds without it - all of the grounds in the basket are soaking wet after the brewing cycle is complete. 15. Amount of coffee brewed is much less than amount of water used: After multiple 8-cup water brews, I consistently yielded 7.75 cups per batch. That's about 3 percent water loss to evaporation. Insignificant. Any more loss than that, then there must be some other cause at play. I could not cajole my unit to lose any more water than was lost to evaporation. 16. Condensation of water in reservoir after brewing creates musty or mildew smell: It could happen in theory. I leave the lid open after brewing for a while to avoid this possibility. Again, this scenario would not be limited to this unit. 17. Reliability after several months: Unknown. Only had it a week. 18. Amount of coffee needed to produce a given coffee strength: My unit yields similar strength as on my Cuisinart maker given the same amount of grounds/water/grind fine-ness. Summary: It seems that some of the complaints are totally unrealistic (IMHO), but others are totally valid. I hope this helps!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "We recently purchased the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programable Coffee Maker and have been extremely pleased with its performance so far. We were fed up with our last coffee maker because it failed to make anything hotter than luke warm coffee. We have had several Mr. Coffee coffee makers over the years, some produced great coffee, others were less impressive. After shopping at our local department store and scanning Amazon reviews we settled on this coffee maker. It has several nice features including a water filter, brew strength adjustments (regular or strong), delay brew, and an optional metal carafe (reduces the number of cups per brew to 8, but keeps the coffee hotter longer). Best of all it produces hot coffee, hotter than any other machine in its price range (that I have tried, and I have tried a lot). Overall it makes good coffee and is probably the highest quality coffee maker in its price range. If you are a true coffee aficionado then you will want to spring for a more upscale coffee maker (look at the Cuisinarts), but for the average coffee drinker this machine works great!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "The reviews are so polar on this item that I can only assume something changed in the production of this item. I decided to buy hoping that the bad reviewers were wrong about the acrid, horrible smell. The coffee maker is quite nice to use, and I would keep it if the smell wasn't there. I, too, found that it puts off a terrible smell that continued pot after pot of water that I ran through it. I must have done 10 pots of water and made several batches of coffee that had the smell. It seemed to just get worse. I took the little tube out that ran the water up to the basket, and found out why it brews so slowly. There are probably supposed to be o-rings around the tube to seal the tube against the swiveling spout, but they were missing. When brewing, a lot of water leaks back into the water reservoir instead of going out of the spout. That tube or something related may have changed and may also be the source of the terrible smell. I can only assume that the production of this product changed at some point, perhaps to save money. Instead they have created an unusable product that I returned.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Our old reliable and inexpensive Mr. Coffee maker had served us well for almost 12 years, but finally the plastic started to show it's age and could no longer resist the daily abuse. The result was the carafe handle and the one of the filter pegs recently breaking. The coffee maker still worked great but clearly it was time for a new one... Let me preface this review by saying that I had two very important criteria when I was looking for a new coffeemaker: 1. Must have a thermal carafe. (wife wanted it) 2. Must use basket filters. (I still have several hundred of them, bought in bulk long ago, so I want to use them!) Price was also a criteria, of course, but I was open to spending over $100 if necessary to get a good one. I have a soft spot for Mr. Coffee based on the long and reliable life of our old one, but I looked at all the brands with models matching the above two criteria. Those two criteria really managed to limit the number of models I had to consider and I didn't see any real outstanding reviews on any of them, even the ones priced over $100. Then I stumbled upon this little gem. The reviews were good, it uses basket filters, and provides the option of buying a thermal carafe. The price is so low that even with the extra bucks to buy the thermal carafe it was still cheaper than pretty much all of the other models I had looked at. Plus it is Mr. Coffee, which has served us so well for so many years. Sold. So, with the story of how I came to purchase it out of the way I can get on to the heart of the review... First off the coffee maker looks great; sleek and compact. It actually takes up less space than the old Mr. Coffee model that it replaced. The instructions are very straightforward and it is very simple to operate. It doesn't have a lot of fancy settings or other complications. It includes a water filter but since we already filter our water I opted not to use it. Before using you are advised to run it through a brew cycle with just water to get rid of any manufacturing residues. You can definitely pick up some chemical smells right out of the box so I opted to run a couple of brew cycles just to be safe. After two cycles it was ready to make coffee. Making coffee is a snap. The filter basket lifts out easily - you just rotate the spray arm out of the way and lift out. This makes it easy to add the ground coffee and to clean up afterwards. After you have the filter basket loaded up with ground coffee you just put it back in and rotate the spray arm back into place. You add the water into the reservoir through the same opening in the top and there is plenty of room to pour. The cup markings are on the right side of the machine and may be a little difficult to see in low light, but I haven't had any trouble. If you measure your water before adding it then it won't matter in any case. Once you have added the water you just press one button to start brewing. If you want to change the brew strength you press one more. The machine will beep when it is done. Easy. The unit automatically senses whether you are using the glass or thermal carafe. The heating element turns on only for the glass carafe since the whole idea of the thermal carafe is to keep the coffee warm without continually heating it. We typically use the glass carafe when we are going to drink up the coffee quickly and the thermal when we have more time and want to drink coffee at our leisure. The thermal carafe easily keeps the coffee warm enough for us for a couple of hours. The instructions advise pre-heating the carafe with hot water to help maintain the temperature but we usually don't bother. This machine brews great tasting coffee quickly and easily. If that is what you want in a coffeemaker then I highly recommend it. If you want lots of fancy settings to fiddle around with then it isn't for you. The clock on the machine is not illuminated so you can't see it at night. If you really want/need an illuminated clock then you will want to find another model. This coffeemaker suits our needs perfectly and the price can't be beat. The optional thermal carafe is great for keeping coffee warm without cooking it - perfect for extended coffee drinking sessions.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "RECOMMEND Mr Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT 12 Cup Programmable Coffeemaker. This coffee maker works great and looks good too. For the price, this is the best 12 cup programmable coffee maker being sold. I read the reviews and this is what I found upon use: 1. Yes there are two slots in the back and if you over fill the reservoir, which would be 12 1/2 - 13 cups, it will run all over your counter like some complained. 2. The coffee finishes brewing on the Strong setting at 160 degrees in your cup when poured as measured with my instant read thermometer. If some need to nuke that to get it hot enough for them, they have a strong tongue. 3. The area to fill the reservoir is behind the basket with a dimension of about 2\" x 5\". You will be pouring into the 2\" dimension from the side of the coffeemaker. I use a Brita water filter pitcher and have no problem. Even the coffee pot works well if you pour it responsibly. 4. The coffee basket uses standard 10-12 cup paper filters and is keyed and only goes in 1 way to be able to close the top. The top swings the water spout over the coffee basket when closed. 5. The water filter that you place on top of the basket needs to be replaced on a schedule and the water filter retainer has a plastic movable indicator to point to the month when replacement is deemed necessary. 6. Yes - water condensates on the lid and if you open it while the hot plate is still on, it will spurt and spit steam into the basket. Luckily the water spout is pointing down when you raise the top. (unlike my last coffeemaker that had the spout in the lid and it spit at you when you opened the top while it was on) 7. The buttons do NOT feel cheap. They feel solid and the indicator lites work well and there are 3 pleasant beeps when the coffee is ready. 8. Yes - there is a plastic smell when new. I wiped the plastic parts first with a wet rag as recommended and used a couple oz. of vinegar in the water and two rinse cycles. Did this twice with 12 cups of water and it came out OK. But I agree - they could steam clean it or something at the factory before shipping. 9. No - the coffee pot doesn't dribble when you pour. (like my last coffeemaker did every time!) 10. The basket doesn't drip on the plate if I pull it half way out first and hold for 1-2 seconds before taking it out all the way to give the basket time to close the valve and the drips clear. 11. MY ONLY COMPLAINT (as with others) is that my cabinets are 19\" from the counter top and the coffeemaker lid needs 20 1/4\" to swing open. They could have made it slide to the left or accordion fold the top. Overall - the best coffeemaker for the price. Works great. Agree with C. heister review above. Amazon ships this product in it's original box. So if this is a gift, you better let then know or the box will be covered w/ shipping stickers.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "I make coffee every morning. It's one spot I'll spend a bit more for a device to make it a better experience. On the + side... 1. It's fast. I don't know how, but even on 'strong' mode, this thing makes my pot of coffee before I finish putting on my socks/shoes and making a cup of yogurt. Very nice. 2. As others noticed, it does look very modern with pretty button colors. 3. Very simple to use. 4. Pot seems to be easy to pour (no drips/spills). Things I found a bit off... 1. The water filter thingy is above the coffee grounds. I have big meat-hook fingers that I need to pinch the filter onto the top without dropping it into the grounds. I have become more nimble at this so now it's just a nuisance because I have 3 things to wash in the morning before brewing (water filter, grounds holder, and pot). 2. Not a cone drip. I had a cone drip. Is it better? I don't know. But, psychologically, I always thought the coffee filtering through a larger % of coffee grounds might give me better coffee. Again, that's probably not true. I noticed most places (Starbucks) use a flat filter. So, it's my own hangup. You can probably ignore this. I've compensated by using twice the amount of coffee when I brew. Actually, I think I'm using the same amount but I never really measured. 3. Shiny metal vs. brushed. Most metal in our kitchen is a flat/dull brushed aluminum. This uses a shiny metal. Just FYI as it may go against your Feng shui. I didn't notice any off taste but I ran two pots of water before I ever used it. Could you pay more for a better maker? Probably. But, I don't know which one that would be. You'd be better off with better coffee grounds, better filters, and better water than spending more on another maker. I'd be the first to buy a better coffee machine that is ... actually better. I've had it a month, no problems and I think this is a keeper at a great price. I can't give it 5 stars because I don't 'love' it -- but, I sure do like it.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is a nice programmable coffee 12-cup coffee maker that accepts both a 12-cup carafe and an 8-cup thermal carafe. With the brew strength option, you can satisfy most tastes. Good design; easy pour carafe. The product is well packaged, but ours was lacking the filter disk for the included water filter system. A quick email to their customer service got a polite response within the stated 2-business days and the filter a week later. The challenge with this product is one voiced about many coffee makers these days - an acute plastic smell taste, even after following the initial cleaning directions. (but since so many models/brands seem to have this problem we thoguht it worth the effort to try to work past it) It took two days of effort to rid ourselves of this plastic taste ... we did 2 rounds of cleaning with vinegar-water followed by clean water and then two rounds of cleaning with baking soda in water (3T to 12 cups, letting it sit in the resevoir for 30 minutes before brewing, followed by clean water. We used a paper filter and not our permanent filter for this. After the first day, the odor was noticeably reduced, but still detectable. We left water in the resvoir overnight and the hatch open and then repeated the process again the next day. Since then, we've had very good tasting coffee and a very nice functioning machine.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I bought this blender primarily for protein and fruit smoothies, crushing ice, and grinding coffee. Out of box experience was good, well packaged, simple. Tested it by using the Easyclean feature, and it worked like a champ. While it is noisy, it is quieter than I expected. Just don't expect to be listening to something on TV in another room if you are blending in the kitchen. The Pros: My first smoothie was done in seconds, no fuss, no muss. A cup of ice, two big scoops of protein powder, fresh strawberries not cut up, and 12 ounces water. I put in the ice and strawberries first, and pulsed about 3 times on ice to get a very nice puree of ice slush and strawberry, only a few seconds each. It's got power to spare. Added the powder and water, hit smoothie, and about 15 seconds later I had very happy happy milk-shaky-like goodness to enjoy. Cleanup and storage could not have been easier. So it's a keeper. The cons: I can see how with so much plastic used, SOMETHING will give out over time and use. HB does not warrant glass breakage, but they say NOTHING about plastics, so if a lid or vent or base go, the 3 year warranty will be worth keeping track of. Summary and impressions: It suits my needs, it meets or exceeds expectations, and it was cheap. So cheap that if it dies after warranty, I won't blink and won't miss it. So after browsing through HUNDREDS of reviews, personal blenders, and Ninja's and such, and nearly going for a Cuisinart personal blender, I figure this one takes up roughly the same amount of space, 700 watts beats 300 any old day, and certainly 185, and why mess around when I don't want to have to worry, I want to blend. Very Worth While. If it had more sturdy and durable looking plastics, or they were some other non-bound-to-fail material, it would get 5 stars. For under $25.00 you can't beat it with a stick. I hope this helps if you're reading this!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "My older Hamilton Beach blender was dying. I did not like a previous Kitchen Aid blender I owned. The bottom of the line Oster I tried made a viciously ear piercing racket. In my dreams I own a Vitamix. Well..in the meantime I need something NOW. I looked at all the reviews of various strata and then said \"just try this one\" ..if it sucks well then it's a backup. Because if you are a morning smoothie addict like me you need a backup. So it shows up. The base is taller than my old Hamilton Beach but the motor is more powerful (700 watts). I like that the buttons face forward and require a bit more of a positive force to engage. I think this is a good thing. You are less likely to accidentally hit them and spray chocolate soymilk or whatever your beverage thing is all over the kitchen by mistake. This blender has \"oomph\" as they say. It fearlessly grinds large frozen blueberries to make a puffy aireated (bubbly) chocolate blueberry banana smoothy which is how I get through swallowing all my various vitamins including the \"horse pills\". It has a real, high quality glass top. Some of the blenders in this price range don't - they instead use that crappy plastic that discolors and cracks. They are honest about the buttons. No fancy schmancy: You get LOW, HIGH. PULSE LOW & PULSE HIGH. 4 buttons. I've never needed anything else. The springs on the pulse buttons and the size of the buttons provide a substantial tactile feedback. All those extra buttons - it's just frippery, added cost and more to go wrong. I want either to get started (low) or go all out (high). Why kid myself? The motor base of the blender is mostly plastic but at this price who's complaining? The styling of the blender is not bad. It doesn't pretend to be something it's not but it's not hard to look at either. It doesn't \"walk\" or jump about the counter - it stays put. I have yet to make Hummous (or hummus) in this blender. Will report back if I have problems with that. Complaints: I tried making Orange Juice and it got a bit messy. I strongly recommend just using 1 can of water and using Low. Then add the remaining 2 cans into your juice pitcher later. When you pour the blended OJ into the juice pitcher do it over a sink. This may have been user error. : ) I've only had this blender for 2 weeks now. The blender will not accept my older Hamilton Beach glass blender top from the mid 1990's. One design decision about the glass blender top on this unit that you may or may not like is ..the inner bottom area (near the blade) has a wider area around the blade..so it needs a bit more liquid (not a ton more) than I was used to with the old blender. Also, I don't know how this wider area around the blade will figure into making hummous. Again I will report back on that later. I have to wait until the hummous making mood strikes. I do not make vegetable smoothies except for my cucumber tzatziki yogurt sauce on rare occasion. So I can't tell you whether this will blenderize celery or Kale. All in all, for my specific purpose (soy & fruit smoothies) I am quite satisfied with this blender and feel I paid a fair price for it ($25.71) You could buy 12 of these for the price of a Vitamix and you can be using it NOW! You can always keep it as a backup or make it the vacation place blender. UPDATE #2 3-30-2013: Still going strong. No hassles. I * did * make hummus (or hummous) recently and found that I had to make a double batch to get it started and get it all blended right - but that's not a big deal in my book. For smoothies the requirements for a good blend are much less demanding. I see some reviews complaining about the motor overheating, or a burning smell. I haven't experienced that. Maybe mine was made on a Wednesday? I just know it works great and continues to do so. Over and out! : ) P.P.S. If you look very carefully at the bottom of the glass blender top right where it tapers to meet the base, you'll see a sort of line in the glass that might \"LOOK\" like a scratch or break. It's not. It's some kind of little ridge left over from the forming or casting of the glass. I figured this out after much visual inspection as I was initially concerned about it. Update: August 17th, 2013 Still going strong... Update #3: Jan 29th, 2014 ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY! Still going strong...", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I bought this blender 2 weeks ago on sale for $19. I do believe it's worth that much. However, I probably wouldn't have spent any more than that on this particular model. I bought it to replace my Oster that recently burned out while I save for a Ninja or NutriBullet. If all you are looking for is a means to blend a basic smoothie or a bisque (which is what I was looking for), this blender will get the job done. By 'basic smoothie' I mean: liquid with some frozen/fresh fruit, protein powder, etc. Raw/hard veggies will not blend well. I was a little disappointed that I could not get Kale to blend into my smoothies to a pleasant consistency. Be sure to put the stuff in and let it run for a bit. Don't be too quick to decide that you need to get in there and move stuff around with a spoon. Be patient. A few people mentioned that its loud. It's actually quieter than my now dead Oster. It is no louder than any other blender I've used or seen used, even a Ninja. All in all, for $19 I couldn't go wrong. But in my opinion, the wattage and the heavy glass jar are wasted on very cheap plastic parts and a blade that leaves much to be desired.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I bought this blender because I wanted to start making smoothies and protien drinks. My smoothies came out thick and nice with no leakage from the blender. The blade is very sharp on this blender for it crushes ice in seconds. The blender is 700 watt, with 12 blending fuctions, which I have not try all yet. The blender is not fanciest but it does have some sleekness to it, but it get's the job done. I am happy about the glass container because some blenders with plastic containers contain BPA. It also comes with convenient cord storage underneath the blender. The blender is extremely loud, not to be used early in the morning if you live with other people, but not loud enough to wake up the neighbors.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I'm a meticulous sort. I check reviews, make comparisons, and try out as many items as I can before purchasing. I was in need of a blender, but did not want to spend a lot of money. I looked on eBay and in various stores, and eventually settled on this Hamilton Beach because of its 700 watts power, glass jar AND low price. It arrived, and I immediately put it to the test, and lo and behold, it is as good as Ninja! I put whole pieces of carrot, pepper, tomato and radishes, with a tiny bit of water (1/4 c) just to test its power, and it made a \"smoothie\" of sorts (it tasted terrible - I forgot the salt - but it was smooth!). That convinced me. If it can crush carrots, it can do anything! I'm a believer!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Yes, you can make a green smoothie with this. Put water in first. Then Kale, spinach, collards, 1 green apple bite sized chunks , 1 orange, 1 banana, oat meal, whole baby carrots and apple cider vinegar. People act like this thing won't blend but it will. If you put water in first and actually let it blend for 1 minute, that's it! Done! This is why you need to decide things for yourself. I'm glad I didn't buy a $500 blender. What is wrong with people? That is rent money and I just want to blend leaves and soft ass fruit.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I am so thrilled with this blender. I was looking at the more expensive models but thought for the price I would take a chance. I am beyond happy that I did. I love the fact that it has a glass container. The blades are designed to mill small items as well as agitate everything inside. I used it to crush hard peppermint candy and it whipped them into a fine powder in a matter of seconds. Yes you can buy one with more watts but how much is enough. For me this serves the needs I have very well while leaving me a chunk of change left for more toys!!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I think this is an excellent blender for the price! I got mine for under $25 shipped (prime shipping). I use it to make smoothies and it handles my frozen fruit (and frozen spinach) quite well. The wave action works well. I usually pour some almond milk in it, then add my frozen items and let it sit for a few minutes to soften before blending. I like that the base of the blender jar is wide. It (and the other parts) are very easy to clean. I don't use the top pour spout so I don't have extra crevices to clean. I just take the top off and pour right out of the blender. Very happy with my purchase.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I really shopped around for a powerful blender that can crush ice with ease and this baby is the ticket! It has a powerful 700-watt motor and kicks the tar out of ice. This is no wimpy blender. Steer clear of the allegedly powerful 450-watt models you may encounter at a similar price. I also like Hamilton Beach products in general. I have a Brew 'N Go coffee maker and a 6-quart slow cooker that I just love. If you go with this blender, I swear you won't be disappointed. Oh yeah, it also has an easy-pour spout that will spoil you for life. Buy this blender!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "This is actually my first blender purchase and it's been a good one. The blender looks good on my counter and it's so sturdy. I don't feel like I have to baby it when I use it. I may buy another one as a gift. I thought about buying another blender device but at $99.00 plus it was too much for a first purchase. The pulse features breaks down the chunky items so that blending a nice smoothie is easier. I was hesitant to try spinach in my smoothie but it was perfect. The consistency of the smoothies are great and I'm excited to try new variations of smoothies. I would recommend this product to any first time buyer. It's a great way to start trying smoothies and not overspend on a product that may not get the job done.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Over the years, I have purchased hundreds of items from Amazon, and for the most part, got what I expected. I never reviewed any of them. But from the moment I received my Instant Pot, I felt that I had purchased something that not only exceeded my expectations, but will make my life easier (and more delicious)! I am a holistic nutritionist and a follower of a lower carb/paleo/primal lifestyle (and yes, it is not only a food regimen, but a lifestyle). Many of the meals I prepare require advance planning and preparation, and I am OK with that, realizing that it is an investment in my family's health and wellbeing. I was looking for something that would support my food choices and perhaps make it a little less time-consuming. I have used a crockpot extensively over the past years and while I appreciate the ease of use and the ability to put a meal on the table soon after I got home in the evening, there is that \"everything tastes the same\" factor I was running into with my family. So I began thinking about ways to cook my meals faster and realized that a pressure cooker may be the answer. But, I am scared of pressure cookers. Even though my head tells me that people have been using them for many years with no problems, my heart said there was a strong chance I could blow up the entire kitchen, myself included. I had no idea there were electric, programmable pressure cookers out there that would virtually eliminate that worry until I began researching them, first on Amazon, and then on other websites. I eventually purchased the Instant Pot over the others because of the stainless steel insert (no aluminum), the size of the pot (I wanted a larger capacity), and the ease of use. The day it arrived, I plugged it in and began reading the manual. The manual was very helpful, even included a suggested trial run to familiarize one with the basics. My first meal was potato soup (I know potatoes are not low carb or paleo, but once in a while you gotta have potato soup). I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was to make this soup that would normally take a couple of hours. I just coarsely chopped the vegetables, threw those in the pot, added the seasonings and the liquid, started the pressure cooker option, and in 20 minutes all I had to do was use my immersion blender to puree the soup, add some cheese, stir and it was ready to eat. AND the soup was every bit as good as my slower version that keeps me tied to the kitchen to stir and monitor until it's done. That is the hidden beauty of this appliance, that while it's cooking your food, you are free to do other things such as harass your kids to get their homework done. No more watching over a pot! My second recipe was lemon pepper chicken wings. There is a searing option, so first I browned the wings in a bit of butter, then added lemon pepper, salt, and 2 more tablespoons of butter. Put on the lid, set the pressure cooker for 25 minutes, and out came the most delicious, fall-of-the-bone wings just loaded with flavor. The family went wild! I also made mushroom gravy (no flour) pork chops in 30 minutes in the pressure cooker - the gravy was so good my son ate in on top of some gluten free noodles the next day for lunch - and a breakfast meat loaf in the slow cooker, also a winner. I am also using this to reheat food since we don't use the microwave anymore and I'm finding that it seems easier and makes less of a mess than going stovetop. That's a pretty long review for a first-timer but I am so enthusiastic about this product that I just had to share.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "I received an advance copy of this electric pressure cooker so I could film an instructional and recipe videos for Instant Pot. I was all set to buy myself a yogurt maker for Christmas and this cooker ruined my plans - in a good way! Instant Pot DUO has all of the things I look for in an electric pressure cooker: stainless steel cooking surface, browning function (at three temperatures), dual pressure settings (high and low pressure), manual programming and delay feature. Additional functions include Rice Cooker, Slow Cooker (low, medium and high settings), Steamer and Yogurt maker. I rarely use the built-in cooking programs (preferring to put the timing in myself with the manual setting button), but for those who do this cooker also has buttons for Soup, Bean/Chili, Meat/Stew, Chicken, Multi-grains and Porridge. I'm only giving this cooker four out of five stars because although the stainless steel cooking surface is FANTASTIC compared to non-stick surfaces, it has a thin aluminum disk to distribute heat evenly only at the bottom of the cooking insert. This means that my favorite pressure cooker pasta and tomato sauce recipe that works on stove top pressure cookers or electrics with a non-stick insert will scorch in this one. Not making ONE recipe is a small price to pay for the peace of mind of not having non-stick coating and chemichals peeling off into dinner. On the plus side, the stainless steel surface REALLY browns meat - and that's a huge advantage over non-stick liners that generally prevent foods from browning well. The stainless steel insert is rugged and I don't have to worry about pressure cooking any sharp foods or using special utensils. Those who prefer the convenience of a non-stick insert can order one seperately from manufacturer. Another nice touch is that you can rest the lid open, by inserting a tab in the handle. Electric pressure cooker lids tend to collect more condensation than stove-top models and hide them in their nooks and crannies.

My family consumes a lot of yogurt (we use it in place of sour cream and milk in most recipes, plus eat it straight with a dab of home-made jam) and thanks to this Instant Pot I can now make a week's worth of yogurt overnight.

{"review": "My mom, the greatest cook on the planet, is the only person I personally know that routinely uses a pressure cooker (stove-top). As much as I enjoy the food she makes while using it, the reason she has it is because my grandmother was too afraid to use it herself. This cautionary tale always gave me pause to think that the risk vs reward of using a pressure cooker was just not there. Why should I use something that you need to babysit or else something bad could happen? That's what I used to think. This is not my first purchase of an Instant Pot. For Christmas, I purchased the LUX-60 model for my partner after receiving an email that it was on sale. After I got the email, I started to do my obligatory research... \"WHAT?... There's such a thing as an electric pressure cooker, it's easy to use, safe, set it and forget it (kind of), AND it can do all this other stuff too?\", I said to myself. I looked at the ratings, and could over 650 people be wrong about this thing? Is it really as easy and wonderful as everyone's saying?? Yes, and then some. So now I own this one because the LUX-60 model was discontinued and improved upon. From what I can tell, the differences in this model are that it has a new \"low pressure\" setting and it also has a \"Yogurt\" function button. I do love yogurt, especially the Greek style and I'm sure I'll try making some at least once. It's pretty prevalent in the stores now and therefore convenient to just go out and buy, but who knows... maybe homemade is better. Also I'm certainly NOT a pressure cooking expert so I don't know what the low-pressure setting is supposed to be for, but from what can gather it seems many people asked for it in this model. I'm sure I'll eventually find recipes where this setting is important. The first recipe I ever made in the new pot was Lamb Vindaloo from Miss Vicky's big book of Pressure Cooker recipes. Lamb chunks, peppers, onions, spices, wine, etc. It took all of 30 minutes to prep, and only 15 minutes to cook. That's amazing - the cooking time was actually LESS than the time it took to prep the ingredients. The recipe came out perfectly delicious except for a few things... a little too much vinegar for my taste, because of the efficiency of this machine there was practically no liquid evaporation (I'll substantially cut back on the water next time), and the recipe didn't call for salt. Other than those niggles, I did enjoy the recipe very much. The machine did a wonderful job of browning and sauteing the ingredients in the all stainless steel inner pot before the lid went on. Push the button that says, \"Saute\" and wait for it to come to temperature (yes, it's that easy). I'm all for \"one pot\" meals because that means less cleanup and there's really no need to brown the meat in anything other than the Instant Pot pot. Next, all ingredients in, set the pressure cooking time and that's pretty much all you need to do... slow cooked-like, fall off the bone meat in 15 minutes... I'm there. No more braising for 2 hours or, \"gee I can't make that because I didn't set up the slow cooker this morning\". The sheer speed of pressure cooking opens up a world of possibilities because you really need a lot less advanced planning to make a great meal. CHANGE IN EATING STRATEGY FOR 2014... (this is NOT a New Year's resolution - they pretty much all fail)... Here's my issue... I eat way too much pasta, rice, beans, potatoes, etc. My current diet is carb heavy and subsequently, so am I (heavy, that is). I need to lose about 35 lbs. to get back to my \"sure I'll go to the beach\" body. All the homemade pizza I make isn't getting me there fast, so I need to do something. There's no way I'm completely giving up my beloved homemade pizza so I'll limit that to one day per month, and basically just eat meats, veggies, and some fruit for the other 29 so so days. Enter this machine: This seems to me to be the PERFECT tool for making low-carb meals (eliminate the rice and potatoes in most recipes and double-up on the veggies). As a matter of fact for me, zucchini and yellow squash make excellent potato substitutes. They're flavor neutral and therefore will likely go nicely in most recipes, but I'll certainly be looking for other starch alternatives as well. I'm looking forward to making food that I've never made before including... Osso Buco, Lamb Shank, Duck, Coniglio, and Cacciatore, etc (sono rigazzo l'taliano). THE ENERGY SAVINGS ARE REAL... Simply put, less cooking time = less energy used. My range-top and oven are electric so it's not to too hard to understand how it will save energy and $$$. Plus when the power goes out and my generator goes on, I may not be able to run the range or oven, but I can still have nice hot meals using this appliance. It only draws 1000 watts, which is less power than my coffee maker or microwave oven. CONCLUSION: This is a great purchase for you if you want the following... Simplicity, Speed, and Versatility. Yes, the machine is a pressure cooker but it also does slow cooking, yogurt, and has a lot of pre-programmed, easy to use buttons. Like I said, 650+ people can't be wrong and the ratings for this brand are way high (including my own). Sort search results by \"average customer review\" and you'll see that Instant Pot comes out on top of the list of the electric models. If you're new to this (as I am)... I'd also recommend a cookbook or at the very least, an internet search for some pressure cooker recipes and websites (check out [...] for some really interesting, Italian-centric recipes). Caio! WAIT... 1/17/2014 UPDATE... A GIFT FOR YOU... My own recipe for baby back ribs... BIG DISCLAIMER: There is a second cooking step involving the broiler on your oven (baby back ribs aren't what they should be unless you crisp them up a bit). INGREDIENTS: (1) Full rack of pork baby back ribs - about 3 lbs. (1) 12 oz. container of beer Emeril's Essence Your favorite bottled or homemade BBQ sauce YES, THAT'S IT PREP: Cut the rack of ribs into 4 even pieces of about 3-5 ribs per piece Rinse the ribs with cold water Dust both sides of the ribs liberally with Emeril's Essence, dust off any loose seasoning DONE PRESSURE COOKING: Pour the can of beer into the bottom of the pressure cooker Place the steamer rack in the pressure cooker Stand the rib pieces up inside the pressure cooker so that the bones go up and down Squirt about 2 - 3 tablespoons of the BBQ sauce into the beer and on the ribs Set the cooker to MANUAL, HIGH PRESSURE, 35 MINUTES (go have a nice glass of wine) use the NATURAL DEPRESSURIZATION METHOD While depressurizing, set the oven to BROIL, HIGH FINISHING: Take the ribs out and place on a foil lined broiler pan, meat side up (E-Z cleanup) Mix 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and 1/2 cup of the juice that's leftover in the pressure cooker NOTE: Save the remaining pressure cooker liquid in the freezer to use in another Pork recipe where is calls for broth - waste not, want not) Put the broiler pan on the 2nd highest rack - crack the oven door Baste the ribs with the BBQ/dripping mixture every 2 minutes or so until the ribs are crispy, slightly charred, and you have one basting left (approximately 3-5 times) Remove the ribs from the oven Baste with the remaining liquid one last time Let stand about 10 minutes before eating (if you have the willpower to wait that long) PREP TIME: under 5 minutes COOK TIME: 45 minutes (including depressurization time) FINISH TIME: 15 minutes TOTAL: about 1 hour - not bad at all!!! VARIATIONS: Add 1-2 tablespoons of Liquid Smoke to the Beer prior to cooking Add 2-3 tablespoons of Molasses to the BBQ sauce for basting... add more broth to keep the same viscosity Even better - Instead of the broiler, throw them on your outdoor grill (winters are cold in NJ... I'll use both methods) RE THE RECIPE: This was my first attempt at ribs in the Instant Pot and it came out GREAT.

{"review": "I do not believe that traditional stove top pressure cookers are that difficult and the newer ones have many updated safety features so a digital, electric pressure cooker almost seems like an extravagant purchase, except.... It is very nice to just put the food in, push a few buttons, and not have to concern yourself until it beeps to let you know the pressure cooking is finished and the warming periods has begun. No more 'watching' and adjusting the pressure. Prepare, set/adjust settings, walk way, cook/depressurize, eat yummy and simple foods. I now use this machine at least once a day, sometimes twice. I can do with this almost everything I can do with the traditional stove top pressure cooker. The only issues is size. These machines are small (six quarts is fine for daily meals or small batch processing). I also can and make large batches of sauces, stews, broths, etc. for canning. None of the digital machines are large enough for this (none that I know of, at least.) Clean up is easy. The only maintenance is inspecting the pressure valve, the screen and the gasket. All of these are very simple. The gasket does retain smells which is frustrating. I do not have this issue with my stove top cooker. The first thing I made was broth. The smell will NOT come out of the gasket. Instant Pot even recognizes this issue and on their website they recommend purchasing additional gaskets just because of this issue. Maybe this is their intent to keep us buying gaskets as if they are consumables? I believe they can do much better with this issue! Why only four stars? It is nice, is is convenient, I use it very frequently, but it is small. The gasket retains odors. Also, I think that Instant Pot could and should include the glass lid and the steaming container. These are 'essential' accessories and it just makes no sense not to have them included. Would I recommend this? Yes, and I have already asked my mom if she would like one.

{"review": "I received my Instant Pot right before the end of the year as I had pre-ordered it. I had done a good amount of research on the previous model and was convinced it could replace my small slow cooker as well as diversify my cooking and reduce my time in the kitchen. The main improvements I liked on this model over the previous model was the holder for the lid on both sides of the handles of the pot, the larger display, and the main improvement I was interested in was the dual pressure setting (mainly comes in handy for veggies for me). At first use it took a little getting used to this new appliance. Some of the features which take some getting used to for me were the pressure release valve, and how to use the electronic controls. When cooking in a pressure cooker using traditional methods it is necessary to set the pressure release valve to closed, this allows pressure to build up in the pot during cooking. During the first few times I had forgotten to twist the pressure release valve to closed. Not doing this will eventually cause a light whistling sound and steam to come out of the release. Twist it back and all is well. I mention this because I read a review giving this pot a 1 star rating, and I could tell they hadn't closed their pressure valve based on the results they said they achieved. Once you have used it a few times you will remember to shut the valve, as I have. Once the valve is closed then the second part I found took some getting used to was the controls, but now I realize they couldn't be easier. This is truly set it and forget style here people. Once you close the valve on the lid and lock the lid in place (you will hear an electronic \"chime\" letting you know the lid is closed) then it's as easy as hitting the button labeled \"manual\" and choosing an amount of time with the selector. This will allow you to follow recipes for times if you'd like. You can also hit the \"pressure\" button to adjust between high and low pressure. There are also a whole bunch of pre programmed recipes, a slow cooker option and a convenient \"sauté\" function which I have used a number of times. 10 seconds after choosing your options the cooker will beep 3 times and the pot will start to heat up. (make sure again you have the pressure release valve closed here) It takes varying amounts of time for the pot to heat up but usually it's between 5 and 10 minutes for the pot to create enough pressure to where it pushes up a metal lock on the back of the unit, this prevents you from opening the pot until the pot is at a safe pressure. Once the lock sets it's only a few minutes till the timer will count down on the pot letting you know how much time is left. So keep in mind it takes 20 minutes or so from start to finish to cook 10 minutes cook time on the pressure cooker. Sometimes it seems like nothing is happening, but if you listen carefully you will hear boiling in the pot whenever it is in cycle. Once the time is up the pot will stay locked until you release the pressure by twisting the pressure release valve, or by waiting for 10 minutes to an hour for the pressure to release naturally. This will drop the metal lock in the back so you can open up the pot. One feature i love is the keep warm function. After any cooking is completed the system automatically goes to \"keep warm.\" One night i forgot my chili in the pot after cooking it, but woke up late at night on the couch to realize it was kept warm all night! Pressing the off button will toggle the keep warm function on and off. The stainless steel cooking pot is very easy to clean, however 6 of 10 on the unit for ease of clean. I love the stainless steel insert especially, it is very thick and of high quality. I just ordered a second one so i can more easily cook and store a variety of different things without having to constantly be cleaning and moving containers and food. It does take a bit of getting used to this seemingly complex cooker, but after a little reading of the manual (which is great by the way) and some experience you will be able to cook just about anything in the instant pot. I just started cooking in the last year and I'm cooking up some amazing soups, chilies, meats, rices, pastas, and vegetables all in my first couple weeks, and i'm a beginner! After looking into the pressure settings (it runs at around 11.x PSI on high) I am able to better plan my cook times. Note: Many recipes I found for pressure cooking on high are for 15 PSI so I have had to add a few minutes to most recipes. I also live in Denver, CO so I have to add some cook time due to the higher altitude as well. I found some good info using google on how to adjust pressure cooking for altitude. I would highly recommend picking up a food slicer with the instant pot as well. I am dicing onions, celery, carrots, pineapple, potatoes, and more in seconds instead of minutes, then with the help of the instant pot I've got that stuff cooked quick and served hot. The slicer in combination with the instant pot cuts my cook and prep time by a third to a half I would estimate, in some cases more. I got a top rated Borner slicer off Amazon for about $30, and it's worth every penny. Most importantly the food tastes amazing, meats are tender, rice is well cooked, veggies are incredible. I would recommend this Pressure cooker to anyone in the market for a replacement slow cooker, someone looking to cook more quickly, anyone looking to eat healthier, and for any person without access to a stove. I plan on purchasing more as gifts for family in the future. For those of you ordering an Instant Pot: Your only regret will be that you didn't get one sooner!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I received my Instant Pot right before the end of the year as I had pre-ordered it. I had done a good amount of research on the previous model and was convinced it could replace my small slow cooker as well as diversify my cooking and reduce my time in the kitchen. The main improvements I liked on this model over the previous model was the holder for the lid on both sides of the handles of the pot, the larger display, and the main improvement I was interested in was the dual pressure setting (mainly comes in handy for veggies for me). At first use it took a little getting used to this new appliance. Some of the features which take some getting used to for me were the pressure release valve, and how to use the electronic controls. When cooking in a pressure cooker using traditional methods it is necessary to set the pressure release valve to closed, this allows pressure to build up in the pot during cooking. During the first few times I had forgotten to twist the pressure release valve to closed. Not doing this will eventually cause a light whistling sound and steam to come out of the release. Twist it back and all is well. I mention this because I read a review giving this pot a 1 star rating, and I could tell they hadn't closed their pressure valve based on the results they said they achieved. Once you have used it a few times you will remember to shut the valve, as I have. Once the valve is closed then the second part I found took some getting used to was the controls, but now I realize they couldn't be easier. This is truly set it and forget style here people.

{"review": "As the title may suggest - I love this little machine! Not only is it an awesome pressure cooker, it also takes over the function of a rice cooker, slow cooker/crock pot, sous vide and *drum roll*... yogurt maker! I have had this machine for about 6 weeks now and not a day has gone by where I haven't used it! Sometimes I use it several times a day! The perfect soft and hard boiled eggs - easily peeled, even from totally fresh eggs! Dairy and non-dairy yogurts! Nourishing, rich broth from bones in less than an hour! Cooking dinner from frozen barely adds a few minutes! Spaghetti squash - moist, oh so flavorful at just the right texture in just 8 minutes! I'm pretty much completely a from-scratch cook. We don't do processed food in our house, so in many ways, the time involvement I have with our nourishing foods is pretty high! And that's ok - it's absolutely worth it. However, if and when I can find something that makes my life easier while still allowing me to prepare nourishing, healthy and flavorful meals, I am ALL for it! This kind of FAST food, I can totally get behind! :) The instant pot is highly customizable to just about anything you might want to cook! You can adjust the time, you can adjust the pressure (high and low,) you have many pre-programmed settings if you so choose, you have the saute function and of course the yogurt setting. All the pre-programmed functions are also customizable, so you're never stuck with something you may not be able to use! Oh, and there is a timer and time-delay function! Totally awesome! Just make sure you closed the venting valve before you leave the house! I've been known to forget that! ;) And one of the best parts - it's not your Mama's scary pressure cooker! This thing is so safe and so easy to operate! No scariness of exploding lids and not knowing if you're up to pressure or not or if you've cooled everything down enough. If there is still any kind of pressure, the lid on the instant pot will NOT open! Oh, and the insert and pot are stainless steel and a nice large capacity - also something that was important to me as I've been slowly switching out my cookware for healthier options! The keep warm function is great, too. I use it to keep food warm as well as a souse vide setting. It doesn't work for everything, but it does work for some souse vide options! Sometimes I also use it for warming food up, as we don't use a microwave any more. I love that meat comes out tender, without that more \"cooked to death\" mouth feel that can sometimes happen with a slow cooker. It's definitely a way to make cheaper cuts of meat work! The browning/Sautee/Searing settings on the Instant Pot is awesome too! It really allows it to be a one pot venture! You can saute/brown in the same pot as you then pressure or slow cook! Oh, another really nice feature on the Instant Pot is that you can rest the lid on the pot itself after opening. You can set it into a slot to the side of the handle once you open it. This comes in really handy, as pressure cooker lids are usually hot and have a lot of condensation on them. So instead of having to find a suitable place to put it, while making sure you don't burn yourself on the dripping water, you can just slot it in there and the vertical position of the lid will take care of any drips. Now to the yogurt function! This was the whole reason why I waited for this model and didn't go with one of the earlier models, and the wait was so worth it. It works beautifully! You can make the yogurt either straight in the stainless steel pot, which is great if you need a large quantity, or you can choose to make the yogurt in little jars, stacked inside. Yes, you can make yogurt in mason jars!! I have made several batches of yogurt so far, both in jars and in the pot itself, both dairy-free and regular! All of it has come out perfect! I have also made cheese cake, dairy-free for that matter and it came out beautifully! A little 7 inch springform pan fits inside beautifully. Note however, I took the handles off the insert, as they were more in the way for me than anything else. I prefer to use a foil sling to get items in and out. If you are not modifying the trivet, a 6-inch springform pan will fit! Even though this isn't a canning pressure cooker, I have used it for smaller batches of particular things. Like, for example garlic confit. What usually takes a constant watchful eye and stirring, is now done in the time it takes to put your ingredients in a jar, place them in the pressure cooker, set it and let it do it's thing. And it won't need refrigerating after you are done, unlike the non-pressure cooker counterpart. Another thing I really love is that it doesn't heat up the kitchen! Yes, if I use the quick release for the steam, there is some heat from that, but it is nowhere near what I would get from the stove! I live in Phoenix, AZ and for many months of the year it is VERY hot here. The last thing you want is have your kitchen any hotter than it has to be! The instant pot barely changes the temperature! I wasn't sure just how my regular recipes would adapt to a pressure cooker, and yes, some of it can be a little trial and error. You do get an guide with the instant pot that gives you some guidelines and also some recipes. Beyond that I have found that you can use any kind of pressure cooking recipe for the instant pot, you can adapt any kind of slow cooker recipe without too much trouble too. And failing that, there are some awesome websites out there like pressurecookingtoday.com and hippressurecooking.com that have you covered with great recipes. hippressurecooking.com even has recipes that are specifically for the Instant Pot, including a video on how to make yogurt in the Instant Pot!", "id": "289913"}

And it won't need refrigerating after you are done, unlike the non-pressure cooker counterpart. Another thing I really love is that it doesn't heat up the kitchen! Yes, if I use the quick release for the steam, there is some heat from that, but it is nowhere near what I would get from the stove! I live in Phoenix, AZ and for many months of the year it is VERY hot here. The last thing you want is have your kitchen any hotter than it has to be! The instant pot barely changes the temperature! I wasn't sure just how my regular recipes would adapt to a pressure cooker, and yes, some of it can be a little trial and error. You do get an guide with the instant pot that gives you some guidelines and also some recipes. Beyond that I have found that you can use any kind of pressure cooking recipe for the instant pot, you can adapt any kind of slow cooker recipe without too much trouble too. And failing that, there are some awesome websites out there like pressurecookingtoday.com and hippressurecooking.com that have you covered with great recipes. hippressurecooking.com even has recipes that are specifically for the Instant Pot, including a video on how to make yogurt in the Instant Pot!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I purchased this because of the stainless steel inner pot, and the many other wonderful options/modes. I'm now more aware of teflon coating/flaking/aluminum cookware, and the related diseases/health concerns. I especially like my IP DUO 7:1 lid's feature - I can lift the entire lid up and away from the unit, and rest it in the fin slot on either side. A very handy feature for this southpaw. I also love the small footprint this unit has, compared to my hulking 8qt Elite pc; using the 'pot' mode, I've made bistek (a Filipino beef and onion dish), tinola, kobacha and long beans, teriyaki chicken and green beans, basmati & jasmine rice, all the above without malfunctions, and no scorching; the 'sauté' feature works so very well, I sear, brown and cook all in the same pot. I've made hard boiled eggs 3xs using the pressure mode (4 min!); the shells peel off easily; whether the eggs are purchased the same day, or in the fridge for a while, they come out perfect! There are no smells from previously cooked foods, which is a constant problem w/my Elite 8qt; its so easy to clean, if something does stick, a simple fix of white vinegar and baking soda fizzes it right off, unlike the multiple attempts w/my Elite 8qt pc. Its a shame the IP DUO 7:1 can't do pancakes! I've used the slow cooker function to make a vegetarian chili, and find it to be user friendly. Just as it touts, this unit is whisper quiet. If I do notice steam or hissing, a quick press on the lid renders it silent, and I've only had to do that once. I used my Elite pc heavily, and never liked the tricky lid. You get used to it, but after using the IP DUO, I'm not going back. I also did not like how the bottom of my Elite pc is so hard to clean if foods are stuck/burnt. Not so with my IP DUO 7:1; I put my Elite 8qt. digital pressure cooker into storage, and will donate it to our church, or give it away, as I have no need for it. No regrets! My family isn't huge on yogurt, so I've not used that function yet; I am curious to see how homemade yogurt tastes, vs the store bought variety. I especially like how there are videos on YouTube to help get started, and the included recipe book has helpful guidelines re: steaming fresh veggies. I'm going to the try fish curry recipe later in the week. I will also attempt to make clotted cream; I've made clotted cream with my Hamilton Beach slow cooker (using the 'warm' feature to slowly scald the fresh cream); I will experiment with my IP DUO when I have a hankering for clotted cream, and will update my review. When/if IP comes out with an 8qt DUO, I will purchase immediately! As another reviewer suggested, I purchased an extra s/s inner pot, and the corresponding glass lid --- which I use when in slow cooker mode. Thank you, Instant Pot!

Honestly I am a pretty good cook. Im just a little forgetful. (I won't claim this this cuts cooking time to the degree that some people claim. The \"cooking\" times you see in the instructions are what you set the pressure cooker to, i.e how much time the cooker is at its programmed pressure. It takes time to get up to pressure and it takes time to get back down from high pressure, so keep that in mind) When I told people that I bought this I received two reactions 1. \"So you know those things are super dangerous right\" I think people are referring to the stove top ones. I mean, granted, there is an incredible amount of potential energy in a pressure cooker. For reference, these thing goes about 10 P.S.I. That doesn't sound like a look, but realize that thats 10 pounds per square inch. If you took a scale and measured out a square inch, you would only need to put ten pounds on it to have 10 PSI, in that little space. But if your scale is normal, and probably a square foot in area, you would have 144 square inches. To get 10 PSI you would need to balance a large elephant on it, 14,400 lbs to get 10 PSI on that scale. I am probably making this all up, but you can see why a poorly maintained pressure cooker can be dangerous. Luckily this thing has about 100 safety features and easy to follow maintenance instructions. I am not greatly concerned about blowing myself up 2. \"So you are probably on a CIA watchlist now\" Well aren't we all at this point?

Cooking chili involves placing some type of bean, tomato paste, tomato sauce, spices(cummin, smoked paprika,salt,pepper) some hot sauce, your vegies, and some vegetable broth in the pan, setting the time, come back when it is done(under an hour) and eat(perhaps add some additional veggies at this point so they are crunchy) The rice recipe is something like add rice, add water, set time to 4 minutes, release pressure after 10 minutes. Eat the best rice you have eaten in your home It is easy to clean, you just have a normal dirty pan when you are done that pops right out. There are tons of recipes to follow when you start out.

{"review": "UPDATE: Many people are reporting problems with the blades, even after a redesign of the seals. Heavy use may result in the blade getting liquid into the seal area causing rust, or blades can break. I have not had this happen, but read ALL the reviews. Some people have had a bad experience. I have had good luck but there seem to be many who have not. The Nutribullet is a mini-blender that blends right into a mug or small vessel. It's a less expensive than blenders that liquify (like Vitamix.) It makes one or two servings at a time. When making smoothies, I want one cup, not a quart. I'm not alone in this--just about all of use want that, so the Nutribullet was invented and it was a huge hit. BUT...it had issues. The motor, being relatively lightweight at 600watts, would burn out if you used it too heavily. This type of blender is best used in pulses and if you read the fine print, the manufacturer tells you that five second bursts are about as long as you should leave it on. I've never had issues, but some people report that they've had problems with the 600 version. I don't use mine for smoothies every day, and I'm single, so I am not a heavy user. However, if you are big on smoothies, have a family or spouse that also drinks them, and if you plan to use it a lot, you'd be better off with the 900 version for better blending and for the heavier motor. Some new additions, based on suggestions from owners: a flip lid and a \"colossal cup\" for those of you who are drinking 32 oz of smoothies and hitting the road. Also, if you are making smoothies for breakfast for more than one person, the 32 oz vessel is great--one for you, one for your mate and you do not need to do two batches. Blend, pour out into the other two cups. The blades are updated to have better seals, as in some newer 600 watt models. The cups are BPA-free. One thing people wanted was 2 extractor blades, because if you are making smoothies, that's the blade you use. The milling blade (single blade) is used for chopping or grinding. So the Nutribullet now comes with two extractor blades so you can set up two smoothies at the same time. The cutting up and preparation is probably the slowest part of the operation. So having two cups ready to go can be helpful. *UPDATE* I have never had \"blade issues\" but many people across the Web and in the comment section below report blades that only last a few months. If it isn't \"user error\" (because you need to use water with each batch you blend) then there are possibly defective blades OR extended use leads to metal fatigue or failure of some other part. In the light of this data, which is out there but not what I've experienced personally, my warning is that if you are going to be a heavy user of a liquifying blender, you might consider a stronger machine such as a Vitamix. You can buy replacement blades for about ten bucks (not including shipping) but if you have to replace blades frequently, this is not a budget choice after all. And it is why I knocked off one star. Cost and function it gets FIVE stars, but durability reports take it down to FOUR. I also use my Nutribullet to grind coffee. I was absolutely bowled over that the single blade works better than coffee grinders I've owned in the past and is faster. I thought it would be too rough on the beans but it isn't. While a \"burr grinder\" is the gourmet way to grind your own beans, I've never found one I liked. So now you'd have to buy an accessory milling blade. It's clearly being geared to the smoothie users (nothing wrong with that) but I also loved it for the single blade. I hope Nutribullet makes this available again or more easily attainable (I suppose if you email them, you'd get a part number and blades seem to cost around ten bucks before shipping.) I don't find their website very detailed; it's geared to quick ordering and simple information, which is good for ninety-nine percent of people and I get that--a good, uncluttered design, but it could have more detail for more experienced owners. If you don't want to own a bazillion appliances, the Nutribullet substitutes for: 1. Coffee Grinder 2. Blender 3. Drink maker 4. Smoothie maker 5. Juicer (kinda sorta, you get the pulp in a liquified puree, though that is good for fiber) 6. Chopper for bread crumbs, seeds, nuts 7. Mixer (for eggs or crepe batter.) Most people buy this for making vegetable-fruit smoothies to incorporate more raw fresh food into their diet, in a digestible form and that's good, but I was pleasantly impressed that the Nutribullet replaces other appliances as well. Downsides: the five-second rule. While the motor is heavier, I would still observe the five-second rule and run this in pulses, not leave it on for minutes on end. It just isn't designed for lengthy running. Also, there are plastic parts (where the blade connects to the motor.) If you do NOT wait until the motor has stopped before removing the cup, you may run a risk of damaging parts some day. A few simple safety precautions will insure a long, happy life. I believe a lot of the unhappiness (units that fail) could be due to \"operator error\" but it's understandable, as we all have used blenders, and those are typically run continuously. Pros: Heavier motor (50pct more wattage) Colossal cup 32oz Flip lid for travel Two cups for serving out smoothies Lids for storage Can replace some other kitchen small appliances (ie coffee grinder) 2 extractor blades for making more smoothies quickly (can set up two cups at the same time) Cons More expensive than the 600 model Comes with 2 extractor blades (the cross shape) but not the milling blade Can't find milling blade on website accessory order page Summary: If you don't own a Vitamix or the older Nutribullet, this is a terrific way to make liquified vegetable-fruit foods. It also makes baby food and can substitute for some other kitchen appliances (if you obtain a single blade.) If you already own a VItamix or a previous Nutribullet, you are only missing out on a more powerful motor that may handle very tough stuff like celery much better, and a larger capacity vessel (which you might be able to order as an accessory.) Since it costs more, you can save money by buying the previous version if you are not going to be a heavy user.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I love this handy little blender, it's lightweight, powerful, and easy to clean. This model has sharper blades than my old blender and it doesn't take up too much space on my counter top. Since upgrading my old blender to the Nutribullet 900 watt I've been using it everyday to make dips, protein shakes and smoothies. The machine blends root veggies, frozen fruit, chia seeds, flax seeds, and ice cubes to a smooth consistency without any lumps. I haven't experienced any leaks like some reviewers have mentioned, I think the trick is not to overfill it with too much food or liquid beyond the max fill mark. So far so good, touch wood! My only complaint is I wish the package included more small cups, but despite this I highly recommend this product to anyone interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle without breaking the bank on a $500 blender. P.S. My nutribullet also included a recipe book with some tasty ideas for beverages, for example, spinach, celery, green apple and banana smoothie. In addition to this I'm also using a fantastic book called Superfruit Smoothies: 50 Healthy Smoothie Recipes for Weight Loss, Energy & Optimum Health. If you're stuck for ideas this book is great.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "OK this is an awesome machine. Obviously better than my 600 watts Nutribullet. The 2 extractor blades are really improved by getting it well sealed inside and out. By saying that it is relative to what people own. I had mine couple months after the inception of the first Nutribullet 600 model and I know that the blades has been modified/improved since then and before the Nutribullet 900 came in to the market. Check on youtube \" NUTRIBULLET IMPROVEMENTS NEW VS OLD\" and a guy (not me) shows how it was improved and these are both 600 models. Back to the 900 series, the 32 oz. colossal cup fits more stuff and that's a big plus. The flip top lid for me is just ok am likely going to use it less. So here's the difference in my experience. I use celery on my older model and I just cant get it extracted really well. So I stop using celery on my smoothie. But when I tried it on this 900 watt series I just cant tell and see the fibers of the celery. The smoothie is smoother than the one done on my 600 watt model. Worth the money. Spoiler though ..... I bought another one as a gift at Kohls for $85. They had the Nutribullet 900 series model for $99.99 sale online (must be a mistake) last Tuesday, Nov 19th. I went to the store and with my cellphone on hand I showed the kohls website price to the manager. He honored the price and have me signed a kohls card for additional 20% discount. Lucky me cause the sale was gone online the next day.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I bought this Nutribullet Pro 900 from Amazon as a Christmas present for my wife back on 07 December 2013 (sold by Speed of Light Distributors). It was delivered quickly, but then sat under the tree, unused, until 26 December 2013. Initially, my wife enjoyed it quite a bit. But, on 10 January 2014, after about 10 uses, the gasket ring on one of the blade assemblies came off. Thinking it trivial, we didn't pay too much attention to it. But, we noted that the manual specifically states that the gasket ring should not be removed and if it does come off, we should contact the company for a replacement blade assembly. My wife confirmed that statement by asking on their Facebook page and they told her how to contact support. She emailed support, told them the story, and gave them a copy of Amazon's invoice. Today, Nutribullet emailed back and told her they wouldn't honor the warranty because the seller (Speed of Light) isn't an \"authorized vendor.\" They told her she could buy a replacement at full price. Needless to say, we declined their offer and are returning the unit to Amazon (even though it's beyond the normal Amazon 30 day return period, it appears that Amazon will allow her to return the broken unit for a refund). So, here I am with a review. Now, on its own, the above is reason enough never to buy anything from Nutribullet LLC. But, on the off chance that you poo-poo that statement, here are some comments on the Nutribullet Pro 900, itself. Due to the joy of the holiday spirit, I paid way too much for this: about $190 (it's much cheaper now). Prior to the Nutribullet, my wife was using a $40 Oster blender to make smoothies. From the glowing reviews here (including reviews that said the Pro 900 version was wonderful for blending ice and frozen fruit), I assumed the almost-five-times more expensive item would be better than the cheaper item. Well, it's not. Though the Nutribullet does handle frozen materials, it does it no better than the old Oster: in both units, the frozen stuff wants to sit in one congealed blob and not blend. She had to fight with it just as much as she did before. For fresh fruit and vegetables, the Nutribullet works fine. But, if it works any better than that $40 blender, it's a subtle difference. The one good thing about the Nutribullet over the Oster is that it seems just a tad less noisy: perhaps the difference between a jack hammer and a jet engine. I'd also like to note that the Nutribullet comes with a boat-load of documentation. Unfortunately, 99% of it is, essentially, infomercial fluff. Plus, the tiny bit of actual information in that documentation seems to be wrong. The thing that immediately leaped out at us (besides failure to honor the stated warranty after about two weeks of use) is that the manual specifically states that you shouldn't fill the cups beyond the fill-line. Yet, that fill-line is approximately at the 2/3 level. Trying to follow the included recipes, my wife found that she couldn't fit half the materials specified into the cup. After consulting the Nutribullet Facebook page, she determined that it's the added fluid that should stop at the fill-line. The solid material could go up to the top since it will blend down to a fraction of its size immediately after the unit is turned on. So, there you have it. An infomercial level of equipment and documentation, breaks in a way specifically warned of in the manual after 10 uses, refusal to honor the warranty after 10 uses, and works no better than a blender costing 1/5th as much. I think that's definitely worth a Terrible rating of 1 star out of 5 and a warning to never do business with the Nutribullet company. My thanks to Amazon for allowing my wife to return this fine Christmas present I got her. EDIT (08/19/2014): We've been using a Nutri Ninja Pro (BL450) for about the last three months without issue. It doesn't have as many attachments, but no one seems to be having gasket problems with it. Also, the blade seems better designed than the Nutribullet's and it handles frozen material much better.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "The people who love it have not had it much past the 30 day trial period. They are cheaply made and designed to fail after the trial period, it is the marketing plan. The little plastic tabs are doomed to break, the gaskets can not be removed to be cleaned properly, numerous complaints about oil leaking from the blade assembly, leaking the drink even though they were not overfilled, burning smells, and motor failures. They do not last. They also do not handle frozen fruit or ice, which most people want in their smoothies. You get what you pay for. This is made in China and not of quality parts. If you are going to use it on a daily basis, then you need to spend the money for a Vitamix or Blendtec and get the real thing. Power, quality, made in USA, good customer support. The Ninja is reported to not work great either. Wasting money or two or three cheaper blenders is what it is, wasting your money, then you finally buy the good one. Get it from the start and be happy. My other concerns with the 900 Pro are: 1. No extended warranty is available. Makes one wonder on the longevity of it. 2. The gasket in the blade assembly is not suppose to be removed to clean it underneath. Food seeps under it and dries. Then it can leach out and contaminate your next drink from it. It is a faulty design. All blenders have gaskets that are expected to be removed and cleaned, along with the other parts, before using again. I returned it and bought the lesser model, the 600 watt, which I see no real difference to justify the extra fifty bucks, plus it has the extended warranty available. It does, however, have the faulty gasket problem. I may return it too if the problem is not resolved by the manufacturer. Who wants a machine that cannot be cleaned properly. Nutribullet tries giving lame methods of cleaning it without removing it, but it does not work. It is a health hazard. Edited: I returned the 600 watt machine after reading all the poor reviews. It seems that after the 30 day trial period is up that the machines start to fail one way or another. I want a machine that will last as I use it most every day. I considered a reconditioned Vitamix with a 5 year warranty. Why waste money with Nutribullet and then have terrible customer service for the warranty period, and then run the risk of being told that it is a wear and tear item and not covered under warranty. It is a cheaply, made in China, unit that is not designed for every day use and does not handle ice or frozen fruit easily, which is what I need it for. I ended up getting the Hamilton Beach Single Serve Blender for $15.00 at Target, and I love it!!! Easier to clean (one item), very quiet, mixes everything I put in the Nutribullet (crushed ice, partially frozen fruit, yogurt, spinach, kale, protein mix, and ground flax seeds. It pulverized it almost as well as the Nutribullet. For fifteen bucks, what do you have to loose to try it first.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I've had my 600 for 8 months without any real issues except the brown goo coming from the blade bearing after a while. To allow better drainage, I now set it on it's edge after rinsing. In addition, I did order a replacement blade for $10 a few months back because the shaft actually becomes wobbly. I'm a big fan of the \"600\" as it actually does a really great job. I've even bought one for a sister, and HIGHLY recommended to numerous others. Two weeks ago, however I purchased the NEW \"900\" from HSN for a TOTAL of $139 including shipping. I knew I'd eventually need a replacement, and with this price and the other extras they were throwing in, I couldn't go wrong, or so I thought!! During the first use, I noticed an electrical smell, but assumed It was just new! The second day, the smell was still there, but in addition, the cup leaked at the rubber seal while blasting! Mind you, I consider myself pretty good at operating my Bullet since I blast at least once a day! My 600 did leak when I first got it, but I quickly learned that was because I filled with liquid above the MAX line. It says multiple places \"NOT to overfill with liquids\"! On my \"3rd\" blast with my BRAND NEW 900, smoke began pouring out of the base after 30 seconds! My normal blend time is 30 to 50 seconds. More than a minute is not frowned upon!! I have seen many complaints over the past year about the lack of customer service, so perhaps I'm lucky I got this through HSN as they take back items within 30 days without issue. On another note, I have learned David Wolfe is more than just their salesman. Turns out he really is a nutrition expert and you can find him ALL OVER youtube. He's been promoting healthy eating long before NutriBullet and seems to know what he's talking about. If the bullet was not supported by him, I might have to give up on my personal promotion of this product. I'm hoping they're just getting too big too quickly and will correct all this. Great item \"When it works\"!! My advice...... hold off on the new 900 for a while, and go with the original 600. They're actually selling them 2 for 1 on the NutriBullet site. I assume to deplete the remaining 600's. Maybe I should grab two more!!", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Returned our Nutribullet to the store because of gasket falling out and spilling the liquid out. We spoke with a Nutri Rep. She wanted us to email/fax a store receipt, even though we registered it, and we would get an improved blade assembly in about 5-7 days. We bought this on March 19, 2014, and only used it a few times. They've known about this problem for a long time yet they continue to sell them. The Nutri Rep said she would send us a new blade assembly as a courtesy. LMAO. A \"courtesy!\" That's their obligation, not a courtesy, and I told her that. Thanks but no thanks. I won't tolerate brand new malfunctioning equipment. We'll find another brand that does not have gasket problems. These Nutris have been on the market for quite some time, and their engineers are late in getting improved blade assemblies. Not the sort of company I would want to buy products again. I should have done more research before I bought this product. A number of websites record the same gasket problem and also other malfunctioning incidents. I recommend others to investigate before buying one.", "id": "289913"}

This then screwed into the cheapest, smallest plastic I've seen that looked like a toy from china! This being one of the MOST USED PRESSURE points by design of pushing the top down & turning gives me pause with regard to being well thought out!

{"review": "We love our Nutribullet Pro 900. However, it appears to have one design flaw: The rubber gasket in the blade assembly falls out and can get cut and ruined (see at least one other comment here that mentions that, plus when I got through to the Nutribullet corporate office they admitted knowing about the flaw). The unit comes with two blade assemblies, so losing one won't be an immediate disaster, but good luck on getting a replacement blade assembly or gasket (they don't appear to sell the gasket separately; you have to buy an entire blade assembly for that broken 25 cent part). Even if you want to pay for it, there doesn't seem to be a way to get it. Nutribullet's customer support is a joke and meant to be a runaround system to make you give up trying to get support. So, but at your own risk. Eventually you'll have a ruined gasket too, and you'll end up spending a lot of time and effort trying to get it replaced. - - - - - Since originally posting the above, I finally got through to a different product support person, and she told me that the parts they sell on their site work with all models of the Nutribullet, including the 900. So, indeed the blade assemblies are obtainable. She confirmed that you have to buy an entire assembly (about $12) just to get the 25 cent gasket. She seemed to acknowledge that they know the gasket is a problem in the design and she read a list of tips they have to avoid the gasket falling out (e.g., don't overfill, make sure gasket is seated all the way down, don't put lots of powders in the initial mix (put powder in after the first blend and then blend a second time), don't run longer than one minute). So, I've upped my original one-star rating to four stars. Nothing is perfect, so as long as the gaskets can be replaced if necessary, then the Nutribullet is wonderful.", "id": "289913"}

My wife likes her tea and guess what? She needs boiling water for that too. Well this cool T-fal electric kettle boils 1 liter of water in just bout 4 minutes and 30 seconds. And 1 liter of water is the perfect amount for my both my French Press and her large tea cup. The electric kettle is two pieces: a lightweight plastic base with a cord wrap underneath and then the Kettle which sits on top of the base. The base has a short-ish cord about 3 feet long. But if your kitchen has an electric outlet really close to where the kettle will be sitting, you can wrap the excess cord around the cord wrap on the bottom of the base... I really like that because it keeps the excess cord hidden away and keeps things neat and tidy (my wife would laugh hysterically if she heard me use the words \"neat and tidy\" because she thinks I'm a slob. But that's another story for another day.) The kettle can be turned 360degrees while on its base. Water level is easily seen through a large water level \"window\" that has a clear mark indicating the maximum water level (1 liter.) It's a little weird that the window extends much higher than the allowable actual water level so you do have to pay attention to the 1liter mark as you fill the kettle or you could easily overfill it causing water to bubble out of the spout when boiling. The lid has a very easy to use button to unlock the lid for easy filling and cleaning. And speaking of cleaning, if you develop mineral scale inside the kettle because of the type of water you have, you can clean it using vinegar. The handle of the kettle is easy to hold on to and has a perfectly placed and quite good sized on/off switch. Of course, the kettle shuts itself off automatically once the desired temperature is reached, but it's nice to know that you can turn it off manually if you wish. And you can also simply remove the kettle from the base to turn it off as well. In my timed test, this brough cold tap water to a rapid boil in just 4 minutes and 30 seconds or so. Not bad. Faster than in the microwave for the same volume of water. We like this electric kettle a lot. It's nice looking, fast at boiling water and is really easy to use.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "My compactor is a 1983 Kitchen Aid by Hobart model and is 18 inches across. The box has the buttons on the side. I have been using plastic bags found at the grocery store, but the bags continue to fall into the box when the compactor is used. Purchased these, they fit, have almost filled the entire bag (with compacting it daily) and the bag has not torn or dropped off of the sides into the box. So far, so good. Very nice to not have to adjust the bag every time. After reading other posts, I learned that you can simply poke holes in the other bags (duh) and those would work in a bind. So in the event these run out or I can't find them anymore...will do that..poke holes in other bags. But these work great. As far as thickness goes, I only have one other brand (Kroger store brand) to compare and the thickness is comparable. If these tear, I will update my review. The size is adequate for my compactor, which is a little larger than the current ones on the market which are typically 15\"... a few brands are 18, so just to clarify that this does fit my 18\" Kitchen Aid/Hobart nicely.", "id": "3741451"}

These heavy duty bags have holes that match the buttons and you hook the buttons into the holes (very easy to do). This way when you compress the trash inside, only the trash is compressed - the buttons hold the sides of the bag in place so they don't slide in and get mashed too!

So I purchased this as a third stick vac. I love it. It is very powerful, I don't understand these people saying it doesn't pick up messes. It totally picks up messes big and small!!!

It's never going to be your only vacuum if you have a big house (the wheel base is small, so you'd be doing a lot of walking back & forth), but if you have a little apartment, or want to keep a seperate vacuum upstairs, or in different rooms of your house, this vacuum is perfect for that! It's basically a hand-held vac, that has a detachable stick-handle, vacuum/wheel base, and crevice tool. Unlike the cordless hand-vacs, it doesn't lose power after 30 seconds, because it's electric. The crevice tool works great, and it's as light weight as one of those kids' toy vacuums. Also, when I emptied it (you will have to empty it pretty much every time you use it, but what do you expect?) I was shocked at how much dirt was in it- I'd just vacuumed with my expensive vacuum, the other day. I'm definitely glad I got this.

{"review": "While it is obvious this very cheap and small vacuum is not the ideal main vacuum of choice for regular vacuum days or actual houses, this is an absolute perfect product for small jobs or, better yet, smaller spaces (especially if you have). It's lightweight and multiple use design and very good suction power all add up to a great deal that work extremely well. I live in a college dorm and got it on sale (Amazon probably won't let me say much else), and could not have been happier. Given the space I live (I live in a one person room) in, it is perfect and spending any more money on a \"proper\" vacuum would be an utter waste of money. This is perfect for small bedrooms, smaller areas, dorms, and quick clean up jobs, with multi function to suit many needs and situations. Performance wise, it works great. I don't have much else to say here. The vacuum sucks up crumbs and other types of debris with ease, so there's nothing else to say here. Sure, the vacuum doesn't actually suck up, ummm, egg yolks, or something, but it will no doubt suck up the majority of typical debris you would expect you would need to vacuum up. Add this to a variety of ways you can vacuum via design and you have quite a good performance product. As far as the design of the vacuum itself, well, I was very satisfied. First off, the thing is very light, which makes it easy to carry, lift, and transport. It's easy to put together, and you can store it by just removing the head and the handle at the end. This also means that you can use more than one vacuum. You can use a regular vacuum, or you can use it as a hand vacuum as well. The hand vacuum also comes with a small attachment for getting into tight spaces, intended for use with the hand vacuum. A few things to know before you purchase this vacuum. As you might expect, a vacuum this small is not for an actual house, so don't bother with this vacuum if you want to make it a vacuum you would use in a regular home. Another thing I HIGHLY recommends is to always clean the filter and empty the vacuum after every use. Being small, it takes no time whatsoever and should not detract you from purchasing it, but is a precaution that should be always taken to ensure that the vacuum is not damaged. Once again, I can't recommend this vacuum enough. For its designed purpose, it works extremely well. Pick it up, it's inexpensive and works wonders for your situations. *Since it is obvious that ALL products have the potential to stop working, I will update this review if the vacuum stops working. However, the vacuum is still working fine so far. This is just a notification to show that this still works after a health amount of use (I purchased it at the beginning of the school year and have used it a healthy amount of times).", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Here in my apt. I find that dust accumulates very quickly and attaches to corners as dust balls. I also have a cat, which simply put adds to the problem terribly. I NEEDED a vacuum that was very cheap so that I could solve this without much fuss. I was tired of using a broomstick, which just makes the dust fly all over! So, let me explain what the Dirt Devil Vacuum does. A usual scenario: My floor has one layer of tiny dust particles attached to it and on top, the dust that moves around and collect as dust balls and cat hair with that. The vacuum picks up this moving dust/hair layer. My point being that, you cannot expect to remove the tiny dust attached to the floor, which you'd remove with a mop. You coould kind of do it, but you'd have to move the vacuum slowly over the floor (I don't have the time for that, so it doesn't do it for me). The vacuum works for what I bought it for, quickly remove general dust and cat hair (which it does really well). - The vacuum is VERY light, which is great for moving it around fast. The little wheels move smoothly, though it is too bad they only move back and forth (...not a big problem, since the vacuum is light you can slide it over the floor left and right just fine). - The attachment to clean corners, that thin tube you see in the picture, is pretty nice. I like that it has a flat shape all throughout, not round with a circular end. HOWEVER, it should be longer!! It's too small! Sure you can reach window corners like in the picture, but you can't reach behind tight areas. You'd have been able to if the tube was just longer or came with an extension. - The vacuum is small and comfortable to hold. - I find that the absorption area at the bottom should be bigger so that I can suck in a larger surface area. Well yea, nice product. You should get it if you are not looking for something very fancy and just want a quick solution for a problem like mine.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Bought it at Target during black Friday for $9.99, then read that Walmart had it for $8. Boo! That said, it's a great little vacuum, so long as you adjust your expectation accordingly. Know that the actual suction opening does not run the entire span of the base, it's a small hole in the middle. I bought it hoping I can use it for the stairs but I think it'll take too long for it to cover the entire area; however, I must say that it works wonders in the bathroom and kitchen picking up cat litter, hair, and minor debris.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I read reviews here for days before I settled on this little stick vac. And, from what I read, I was able to determine that I was able to use this as my only vac in a studio apt. with separate bedroom. I have not been disappointed. In fact, everytime I use it, I want to come and write more and more reviews about how great this machine is! I am, frankly, shocked and stunned. I use it for carpetless floors and also carpeted bedroom and living room. I also use it on the couch and on my bed. I have two cats in this small space so there is a lot to pick up! I recently started suffering with allergies for the first time in my life, so I've been vacuuming a lot to try to clean my environment as best I can. I have gone over the carpets twice in one day and each time the cup comes away full of hair, dirt, and unbelievably what must be the former tenants carpet fresh powder. Yes, it really does SUCK that hard. I am telling you, this is amazing! I have tried many, especially the cheap Eureka, which always lose power after only a couple of years. DD is just as inexpensive but superior in quality. I've been using this power stick for 8 months now and no loss in power in the least. I picked up a penny the other day when I was vacuuming. It picks up cat litter, too. Anyway, I need to buy a sealed HEPA filter vac now because of the mystery allergies, but I will never buy anything other than a Dust Devil from now on. In fact, I'm foregoing buying an air purifier because I am so confident that Dirt Devil products will get the job done. If you are tempted to buy, I will be selling my stick at a good price, so look for me in the Used prices. It is still phenomenal and like new.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I just assembled and used this vaccuum for the 1st time, lastnight (ie: April 5, 2013). For one thing, I Loved how easy it was to assemble! Basically, stuff just pops into the sockets where they belong. You will only need a philips screwdriver to tighten 2 screws on the handle (which are included). Besides that, I think the cord is a very nice length! Granted, I live in an 880-sq.ft apartment, so there isn't a whole lot of ground to cover, but I only had to unplug it once in order to reach all areas of my apartment. Besides that, my girlfriend & I were amazed to see just how much dirt & stuff this thing picked up!!!!! This vacuum does make a fair amount of noise, but that's because it has a sweet motor which obviously does exactly what a GOOD vaccuum is expected to do! Finally, it was so easy to remove the \"dirt canister\", empty it & put it back in place! Also, it has a dial on the front which adjusts the vacuum's height, and the machine is very easy to manuever. I love it, so far! I will follow up here if this vaccuum malfunctions in time, but for now, I'm highly impressed! ***UPDATE*** Today is May 29, 2013. I've owned this vacuum almost 2 months and have used it once per week to clean my apartment. I have NO complaints so far. It's still going strong, and I really like how the canister is so easy to dump out & replace. I'll be sure to post here again if/when this thing lets me down. ***UPDATE*** Today is December 15, 2013. It's still working great, and I still love it. No complaints! :) ***UPDATE*** Today is June 18, 2014. It's been about 14 months now and I continue to use this vaccuum frequently. NO complaints. It still operates as expected, and Very easy to use. I'm extremely pleased! NOTE: I learned a very important lesson!! I recently began using a powder deodorizer on my carpet (the last 3 times I've cleaned), and I noticed that the vacuum's base area (motor?) was getting unusually warm. Of course I became concerned so I called a local vacuum repair shop just to ask if this sounded typical. The shop worker immediately told me that using any powder product with a vacuum is THE WORSE thing you can do! The powder is so fine, it gets into the vac's motor and will eventually causes it to overheat! Using these kind of powder products, kills vacuums! I immediately discontinued using the deodorizer, and so far, my vacuum seems fine. So, beware.....NO powder deodorizers! :)", "id": "510106"}

I had vacuumed the rugs/carpet and they still had a fine layer of dog hair over them which I could remove with a dog brush....that is a lot if work. I scanned the products available and came across this one for $80. I vacuumed the kitchen rugs with the Oreck and immediately did a follow up with the Bissell....I filled the Bissell cup ! The Oreck ( and the expensive bags ) is out. This is it for me and I could buy three more and still pay less than the Oreck.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I am a vacuum cleaner guru and 'snob'. I've owned about 20 different 'bagless' models in the past 15 years, and am always happy to review the great ones, in order to 'get the word out'. If you want an excellent, everyday bagless vac without breaking the bank, this is it! This 'CleanView OnePass' model has excellent suction (you can feel the suction) and edge pickup abilities, carpet and hard floor performance, and is not as loud as other vacs. The dirt bin is a good size that holds a lot of dirt, and it is easy to empty and snap back onto the machine. I use 2 main vacs in my house, which are my current favorites. The Bissell and my Shark 'Navigator NV22L'. I've had my Shark almost 2 years now, but the hose that connects into the sweeper base cracked, and I cannot find a replacement, so I used duct tape to seal it as best I can. I was going to purchase yet another Shark, but I don't like the somewhat narrow path compared to the wider Bissell, and i'm afraid the hose will crack again prematurely. It takes me much less time to vacuum with the Bissell. Also, the Bissell has manual height adjustment settings, which is always a good feature. The Bissell also cost half of what the Shark Navigator does. In summation, you cannot do better for about 70 dollars! 4.5 stars. 5/23/13 update: It is now one day after I wrote this review, and I wanted to tell everyone about a simple mod (modification) I did to this vac to make it perform even better! There is always a bit of leakage in vacuum hose assemblies that robs a vac of some of it's suction, so I applied some white 'DAP Alex Plus Easy Caulk' around the hose where the flexible part meets the connectors to completely seal the slight gap that exists. I gave it a day to dry and cure, and I noticed an increase in suction power! What was once an already excellent vac, with excellent suction, is now a MONSTER! I would not be surprised if suction increased on the order of 10 to 20 percent!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I bought this vac for my wife on March 23rd, 2013 and today (about 4 1/2 months later) it goes to the trash can. It worked well until about a month ago when it started going through belts. Today, my wife told me it had been smoking when she used it (I thought it's too young to be smoking). Being an engineer, I took this as a challenge and decided it was time to get to the bottom of it. I ran the vac with the bottom cover removed and observed that the belt migrates over to the end of the motor shaft and begins rubbing on the metal rub plate. I wondered why the belt moves off the center of the motor shaft. A close look revealed that the motor shaft is no longer parallel to the beater brush. I suspected something had slipped out of place inside the motor housing so I unplugged it and took it apart to see if I could fix it. As I was taking it apart I noticed that the plastic housing surrounding the motor shaft was deformed from excessive heating. In fact, after about fifteen minutes of disassembly time, the motor was still too hot to touch. At that point I realized there was no fixing this. They've taken too much cost out of the motor (not enough iron and copper) which makes the motor run too hot which in turn softens the plastic housing causing it to deform. It's a shame, if they had spent about five bucks more on the motor it would have lasted for years.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I bought this vacuum as a secondary machine for light duty in some rooms. Our primary vacuum is a 6-year-old Dyson that is still working like a champ. For what this vacuum is... it's a great deal. I'm not sure if you can find a better machine on the market for 80 bucks or less. Its cyclone is very rudimentary, but it does have decent suction and vacuums almost as well as our Dyson. The attachments are decent for a vacuum that costs less than a hundred bucks and its overall design and build quality is impressive for a machine in its class. Bissell has really stepped up their game with these newer machines. Some nit-picks I have about it: - Although the pre-motor filter is washable and \"doesn't need replacement\" according to Bissell, I would be surprised if it lasts for over a year before needing to be replaced. It is made from cheap single density foam and I've noticed that it traps dirt into the foam fibers even after washing it. Also, given the rudimentary nature of the cyclone, roughly half of the fine particle dust ends up right in the filter, slowing the suction down. So if you live in a dusty home, or have pets, you will be cleaning and washing the filter every single time you empty the canister… which I am resorted to doing. - Bissell chose to use stickers on the vacuum which leave behind glue residue when you remove them. This is a colossal fail in my opinion and lowers the overall quality of the vacuum. - The “One Pass” technology is just marketing drivel, let’s just call it what it is. There is nothing special about the design of the brush bar on this vacuum. - Although not surprising in this price range, and I don’t think Bissell claims that it has it anyway, but this vacuum does not have a sealed HEPA cycle. This means that although it has a HEPA filter, it is possible for fine dust particles and allergens to escape the filter through gaps in the vacuum itself, or in the seal of the HEPA filter. It seems to do an OK job filtering particles, but I can still smell dust when I use it.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "If you are looking for a great vacuum to get the dirty job done quickly and still stay within a budget, then the BISSELL CleanView with One Pass Technology is for you! It is quite comparable to much higher priced Vacuums in the quality of cleaning. It just has a few design flaws that could be altered to make this vacuum more user friendly; Thus the 4 stars. PROS: - Very easy assembly. No Husband required! Had it assembled in less than 15 minutes. That includes pulling it all out of the box. - Bagless! love this feature! No changing of bags - Washable Filters! N0 need to replace a lot of parts weekly/monthly/etc. - All accessories easily dock on the vacuum! No extra storage space required. - This vacuum is much quieter than any other vacuum I've ever used. Not whisper quiet, but a lot more than other vacuums. - Moves very easily across all levels of carpet thickness. I don't feel like I have to put much effort into pushing it across the floor at all. - It is very lightweight and easy to carry up and down flights of stairs - Easy to adjust height level of brush for thicker or thinner carpets - Handles Cat/Pet hair very well! Easily picks up and removes cat hair from the cat bed, carpet floor, and furniture. - The Turbo Brush is well powered and does a very good job cleaning up little spills. - Cleans up more in one pass than any other vacuum I've used. I crumbled a lot of Ritz crackers onto the floor and pushed then into the carpet a bit just to see how well it worked. In one pass over, you couldn't see any crackers left behind! This definitely saves me time cleaning! CONS: - I wish this vacuum had a better cord winding system. I am just silly and hate winding up the cord after every time I vacuum. I'd love a fast auto-winding feature. So I was sad to see this model doesn't have that. - The Hose can actually extend up to 6 feet. Now this could just be because my vacuum is still so new, but it doesn't like to extend well without pulling the entire vacuum unit over. I have to have someone hold the vacuum in place while I pull on the hose to reach the crevices or do the stairs. - The actual vacuum unit tips over far too easily when using the hose. I can see this issue becoming less prevalent as I use the vacuum more and stretch out the hose, but I don't see it going away completely even after a lot of use. - Power switch is not in a user friendly location. The power switch is on the side of the vacuum and you have to bend over to reach, instead of a simple push with the foot with other power foot buttons at the bottom. - The power chord seems a little short. I have to constantly stop, unplug and move the cord to a new outlet so I can keep vacuuming through my house. It's about just 2 feet short of what I would prefer. I can almost do my entire living room and hallway; but I just barely pull short of the end of the hallway, so I have to move the plug to finish off. Overall: Even with the few cons, I am still in love with my BISSELL! And it is still light years ahead of my old vacuum! And really you can't beat the price for the quality of clean you are getting. I couldn't be happier to have a quality vacuum that really cuts down on the time spent vacuuming, so I can spend it on more important things like my kids, reading, cooking dinner, or just taking that 10 minutes to catch some special \"me\" time! BISSELL's CleanView Vacuum with OnePass Technology speeds up the monotonous chore of vacuuming so you can spend more time doing things you love and spend less time cleaning.

{"review": "If you're considering this vacuum, look at the tendencies in the ratings. The positive ones tend to be written immediately after the vacuum arrives. And yes, the first 3-4 months you use this vacuum you will probably be impressed, given the price. However, it is incredibly cheaply made and will disappoint quickly. My problem with it is that the belt slips almost off almost immediately after I put it back on. I disassembled the machine and found that there is absolutely nothing holding the belt on to the rod upon which it fits. That could have been solved in the engineering literally for 50 cents. It appears that I'll be needing to replace the belt every couple of months, maybe a belt with maximum tension might not fall off so quickly, but I'm not hopeful.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I bought this vacuum in desperation as we were moving out of a house we were selling and our older vacuum gave out. I ran to a local store that only had small, inexpensive vacuums, and grabbed this one. It worked fine for a very short amount of time. Now, a couple of months later, it's going in the garbage. The brush quit working, and I thought the belt must have broken---strange that would happen so soon, but an easy enough fix. Upon removing the bottom cover, I discovered that the belt was NOT broken, but had slipped off the metal rod from the motor. I put it back on, and went back to vacuuming. Not 30 seconds later, it was off again. So, to vacuum my house, I go through the process of vacuuming for 30 seconds, put the vacuum on a table, remove all 7 screws, put the belt back on, replace all 7 screws, vacuum for 30 seconds, etc. When the belt is on (for 30 seconds at a time) it works quite well. But, I don't have the time or patience for this process of replacing the belt every 30 seconds. Ridiculous. This is an obvious design flaw. Do not purchase this machine!", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "Length:: 5:36 Mins UPDATE: 7/29/2013 - A few people were asking how long the steam mop will operate on a tank of water so I ran a test. I filled the tank, put it on high steam output and it ran continuously for 15 minutes. So there you have it. It would presumably run for a bit longer at lower steam settings. --- The Bissell PowerFresh Steam Mop is a very easy to handle and effective tool to clean and sanitize hard floors. By hard floors, I mean ceramic tile, vinyl, laminate, marble, stone and sealed hard wood floors. Concerning hard wood floors, you would be well-advised to try it in a small inconspicuous area first to ensure your floor can handle the heat and steam. Some \"sealed\" hard-wood floors may be less tolerant of the heat and steam which could have negative consequences. The Steam Mop is something a little different than what I was accustomed to using previously to clean my floors. Unlike other devices, this does not use soap, detergent or any type of cleaning agent. It simply uses steam and a microfiber cleaning pad. The steam loosens the gunk on your floor while the cleaning pad lifts it away. It's amazingly effective and my sealed hard-wood floors look shinier. The steam action has cut through the grime of old scum, wax and who knows whatever else to leave a much shinier surface. I like the idea of not having to buy special solutions, such as what you have to do when you use a Swiffer Procter & Gamble 29914 Swiffer WetJet Mop or similar thing. And honestly, the Bissell Steam Mop will pay for itself since you do not have to purchase additional supplies for it other than the optional fragrance discs, that I don't even use. Assembly of the SteamMop is quite simple. The handle inserts into the lower body and is secured by a single screw. On my steam mop, the screw was inside a small clear zip-bag that was taped to the handle. The next step is to attach the lower body to the mop head by snapping it into place. The mop head can be easily removed from the handle assembly by depressing the QuickRelease tab on the mop head. This facilitates the removal of the microfiber mop pads for cleaning. Two cleaning pads are included. One of the pads is for heavier duty cleaning and has a more abrasive weave that is more adept at cleaning heavily soiled, sticky or otherwise more difficult to clean areas. The other pad is for normal, lighter duty cleaning. The mop pads can be machine washed using liquid detergents. It is not recommended to use fabric softeners or bleach. It is also recommended that you air-dry the pads rather than using a dryer. Each pad has a little mesh pocket on the inside into which a \"fragrance disc\" can be inserted. You do not need to actually use a fragrance disc. But if you do like the idea of using the fragrance disc but would prefer a less strong scent, you can simply cut the disc in half and only insert half of a disc into the mesh pouch. A nice feature of the mop head is the integrated brush on the trailing back edge. The brush can be engaged when needed for heavily soiled areas or to better clean grout. The brush is easily engaged by your foot or hand and just as easily dis-engaged by pushing the button. Once everything is assembled, you fill the water reservoir with room temperature water; distilled water is recommended to prevent mineral buildup in the machine. As soon as you plug the machine in, a light on the Steam Control panel will begin to blink for about 30 seconds. When the blinking stops you can begin using the machine. There are three levels of steaming action that are selectable by successive pushing of the Steam Level Button...low, medium and high. Before you actually start using the steam mop you do want to thoroughly sweep or vacume the floor. Steam is practically instantaneously generated and you can begin cleaning right away. For sanitizing areas of the floor, you simply move the steam mop over the area and let it sit for 15 but no more than 20 seconds. You may want to reconsider doing this on a hard-wood floor however until you are sure your sealed hard-wood floor can withstand that amount of heat and moisture. I'm really liking the Bissell Powerfresh Steam Mop. It's really easy to use, is highly maneuverable, and is easy to clean & store. It does not take up much space either. The cord is is 23' long which is very generous and wraps out of the way on the handle mounted cord wrap. No harsh chemicals, detergents or other cleaning agents are necessary so that reduces the cost of operation. It's a winner and does a fantastic job on tile and other hard floors. It almost makes cleaning your floors fun... almost :-)", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I don't like old fashioned mops, as they clean surface dirt but I don't think they effectively kill bacteria. I'm not opposed to using chemicals, but prefer not to when I can reasonably avoid doing so. So I've progressed from avoiding mops as much as I could, to using a Swiffer mop, then finally opting to use a steam mop. I prefer the steam mop over the other two. The Bissell Powerfresh steam mop, made in China, features includes an easy scrubber, 23 ft power cord, two washable Microban microfiber mop pads, and a two year limited warranty. The box contains the handle, lower body, mop head, fragrance discs, and two mop pads. The SmartSet steam control provides three settings from light to medium, and sanitizes with steam to kill 99.9% bacteria, and is safe to use on marble, ceramic, stone, vinyl, laminate, linoleum, and sealed hardwood floors. Assembly requires snapping the main pieces together and screwing the handle into place. To use, put on a mop pad, add water to the tank and plug in. There may be some knocking sounds the first time the steam mops used, this is normal. Once the ready light is illuminated, select a steam setting and start mopping. I dislike perfumes and dyes, so the concept of using a fragrance disc to make the floors smell like a spring breeze seems odd. I want my floors to be clean, not scented. I guess Bissell thinks you'll miss the fragrances from chemicals used for regular mopping or the Swiffer. Adding fragrance for the sake of scenting flooring materials just doesn't make sense to me. Fortunately placing the scented discs into the mop pad pocket is not required. While mopping, the steam is always on. My other steam mop has a switch to turn on steam when needed. I like being able to control the steam, and without this feature the mop pad on the Bissell Powerfresh steam mop becomes saturated with moisture. Additionally, taking a pause requires turning off the steam mop. Plus, a tray isn't included to set the steam mop into to protect the floor while pausing or during cool down. The mop head is a 13\" wide by 7.5\" deep arched back rectangle connected with a swivel joint. The mop head is larger than the one on my other steam mop, but seems to fit in the same tight spaces. The real difference comes from my other steam mop using a ball joint which provides better maneuverability. The Bissell Powerfresh steam mop is a decent basic floor cleaning tool. However, after using the Hoover TwinTank steam mop, I greatly dislike using the Bissell Powerfresh steam mop. Both are effective at cleaning floors, however the Bissell Powerfresh steam mop lacks the features which make the Hoover TwinTank steam mop so much better. PROS: Easy scrubber reaches down into grout and crevices SmartSet steam control for light to heavy cleaning Sanitizes and kills 99.9% of harmful bacteria Washable Microban microfiber mop pads Safe to use on marble, ceramic, stone, vinyl, laminate, linoleum, and sealed hardwood floors Two year limited warranty CONS: Leaves the floor with streaky appearance Swivel joint at mop head Steam is always on", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I`ve wanted a steamer for hard floors for years and purchased the Wagner 905 1,500-Watt On-Demand Power Steamer and Cleaner in early 2011. It worked OK, but I wasn't crazy about it. Although small, the canister proved tedious to drag around and Wagner didn't make it easy to buy replacement pads. Actually, I've never found replacement pads, and had to substitute something else. I resolved that I would replace that Wagner with a stick steam mop by a manufacturer that supports its products with replacement parts, accessories, and supplies a little more. Having had excellent experiences with Bissell, it was a no-brainer to try out the BISSELL Powerfresh Steam Mop, White, 1940. The Bissell 1940 is almost ridiculously simple to use. It is light, easy to push, compact to store, and I can buy supplies for it from Amazon, Bissell, or a variety of other local and online stores. My home has linoleum in the kitchen, dining room, and two bathrooms. Although the water reservoir seems small, I was able to do all of these rooms with only two fill ups, with a little water left over. I also used quite a bit more steam in some areas. The mop comes with two pads, one that is smooth and another with treads that help clean more stubborn spots. I used the one with treads and was very pleased. The mop also has a scrub brush that can be easily flipped down with your foot to tackle stuck on dirt. When you plug it in, the mop turns on. It doesn't emit steam, however, until you choose your steam setting (there are three settings.) This mop is ready to go within 30 seconds of plugging it in. Removing the mop pads and putting them on is very easy, as is slipping a scent disk in the pocket inside the pad. The scent disks aren't necessary for cleaning, but they do emit a wonderful, fresh aroma that I quite enjoyed. When you finish mopping, the pad can be washed in your washing machine and then air dried, reducing cost by allowing you to reuse the pads until they wear out. I was worried when I began that this mop would have trouble in smaller areas such as between the commode and the wall, but it worked almost as well sideways as it did normally. Also, I was very happy to find that the water reservoir remains pretty cool, making it easy to refill when I ran out of water without having to wait for it to completely cool down. Of course, you should always exercise caution when working with hot steam, but Bissell did a very good job designing this to help reduce the possibility of accidents with this task. After using it, my floors look and feel very nice and clean. They dried quickly and left no sticky residue behind. I cannot praise this steam mop enough. It lived up to all my expectations.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Hi. I'm an artist. Which means I don't earn much... but all the chores of a house husband. I don't mind most chores. I do windows, despise dusting, and resent mopping. But you have to mop the porcelain floors or you can't invite guests over. It took a long time for me to figure out how to mop properly. I used one of those sponge mops (which you can pull back into itself to ring out the dirty water). Instead of ringing out into the same bucket, I'd ring into the sink and even wash the sponge. Picture this. Even in a moderately sized condo, I'd rinse the mop at least 20 times during once mopping. That's a lot of hot water. So is the two gallon bucket I'd have to fill with Simple Green. Gallons of water and chemicals. And when I was done? MEH said the floor. It was better but not optimal. So my mop broke and I went to replace it. Couldn't. The Rollomatic was no longer at OSH. Which sucks because I have a replacement head that's now useless. I went to Amazon to see if they carry it. They do, but they also carry this Bissell baby. It looks like cheap plastic. Know why? To keep it light. If it were metal you'd never use it. This light design is just right and about 1/4th of the work of the Rollomatic. And there's no bucket to move around. The 'bucket' is a small reservoir that could hold two cans of Coke in it. Maybe one and half. When you open the box, assembly should be easy but for one thing: when you attach the handle to the unit, the handle can be slid in upside down. Which means when you go to put the one screw in it mysteriously won't work. I'm not the handyman type but I know 'engineers' can paint on a little red line on the handle and unit and tell us to make them 'match' each other to avoid this mistake. Or shape the rod in such a way that it can only slide in the correct way. A silly little design flaw. Okay. There's no on or off switch. You just plug in. A little blue light blinks. About a minute later it's ready. Then you pick what steaming power you want. Light, Medium, Heavy. Understand the unit comes wearing a 'gentle mop' and includes a 'scrubby mop' in the box. So it therefore comes with six levels of intensity: gentle light, gentle medium, gentle heavy, scrubby light, scrubby medium, scrubby heavy. I put off buying a new mop for ages and so it was particularly dirty. On my tile floor in the kitchen and major walkways, scrubby mop/heavy steam was needed. In other areas the gentle mop/medium steam did the trick. I should say here that I had to change from the gentle mop to the scrubby mop because the gentle mop got filthy fast. If Bissell wanted to be the bestest -- they'd include an additional set of mop heads for the same price. If that didn't get through: if you have a ginormous home to mop, you'll need more of the mop heads if the floor is particularly dirty. A few cool things -- 1. Under the cabinets in my kitchen is that part of floor the normal mop could barely clean. Grime would slowly build up and the only way to fix that was paper towels, spray, and hands & knees. This Bissell? Cleaned MONTHS OF FILTH in minutes. (This is what made me first consider taking the Bissell out for dinner and a movie.) 2. You don't need Simple Green and Pine Sol. This is STEAM. And you don't need a ton of water. (This is when I considered asking the Bissell back to my place.) 3. What was a solid hour of mopping is about 25 minutes with the Bissell. And that old school mopping used to make me so tired I refused to clean the upstairs linoleum bathroom... which is only a few feet wide. I did that too... in two minutes. (This is when I poured the wine for the Bissell and dimmed the lights a little.) 4. Because it's now so easy to 'mop'... I can do this weekly. Instead of what seemed to be every 4-6 weeks. (I told you I didn't like mopping, didn't I?) (Oh, and this is when my wife caught me and the Bissell in a compromised position. But this is my only affair and I won't apologize! Damn it this thing is awesome. Sure I wish she was a cheaper date, but hey, she sure can make me steamy.) <3 THREE MONTHS UPDATE: Yes, my affair with this thing is still on-ongoing. Maybe not as hot and heavy, but yes -- there is still love. However, I stumbled upon something which requires rewording and correcting. Above I said that grime came off with the first uses. And it did. What I didn't know until recently was that it doesn't remove ALL the grime. I had six or so years of it building up slowly, despite my Simple Green mopping and Bissell steaming. I basically forget my floor was matte finished, and you could clearly see a grimy 'shine'. So I got on my hands and knees with a harsh plastic brush, hot water, and some soapy water with some OxyClean mixed it. Surprise surprise -- this cleaned off YEARS of gunk. What I thought were scratches in the porcelain floor were really scratches in the gunk. This is why people hire people when they sell their home to come in and use those machines to REALLY clean the floor. And so my question will become IS the Bissell enough to stave off this 'gunk' that builds up -- and how long before I'm forced to scrub hands and knees style. If I can go a full year without needing to scrub so hard, I'll be satisfied but not delighted. If it's two to three, delighted but not thrilled. If the Bissell prevents me from ever having to scrub the floor again, I'll be Michael Jackson Thrilled. So I'll come back the first moment I have an answer to that question.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I did quite a bit of research before buying. In fact, I used to work for a competitor to Bissell and was involved in work to review and develop products made, so I know a thing or two about floor cleaning (vacuums, rug \"shampooers\", hand-helds, sweepers, and so on). It's also why we decided to replace all the carpet in our downstairs and I endeavor to get rid of it upstairs some day when budgets allow! On to the Powerfresh Steam Mop: Overall this product does what it says it will do - it steams and cleans the floor. First, a response to many reviews I've read of this and other products: it is absolutely true that you \"push around dirt\" - guess what - even when you are on your hands and knees to scrub your floors, you do that! Mop buckets contain dirty water. Even with clean water and a clean mop, one swipe and you are now pushing that dirt onto the floor with the next swipe. Likely the \"cleanest\" clean is using multiple towels each soaking in a cleaning/hot water solution that gets pushed on a small section of the floor before being tossed into a bucket (for later washing in the machine) and using a fresh towel for the next section of floor. Usually, one needs to use multiple towels to the dry the floor when using this method. It is time consuming and quite a bit of work. This mop does clean dirt up, but like any cleaning method, that dirt is stuck to the item used to swipe it up (the pad) and then pushed around. The benefit of a steam mop is that at least steam is used to cut down on bacterial and germ spread (the heat will at least kill most of it). Now, pros and cons: PROs: - the mop is very easy to assemble and set up out of the box - just a couple parts to snap together - one screw to hold the handle onto the body and it's ready - 5 minutes max - the mop is very easy to set up each time you use it - I change the pad to a clean one after each use, so it stays ready in my closet. The small blue container that you fill with water snaps out and there is a twist cap on it - twist off, fill (recommended is distilled water, but I've used tap), and replace it. Plug in the machine, wait about 15 seconds and the flashing blue light stays on and it is ready. - the mop is very easy to use, There is one button to press. Press it once for low steam, another time for higher level of steam, another time for the highest level of steam, and a fourth time stops the steam. That's it for controls. NOTE: it DOES turn off if you press it around to the fourth time - at least one reviewer claimed that this was not the case, but it does turn off. - the mop is very lightweight, making it easy to carry upstairs to the bathrooms in our house, even when the tank is full (the tank is small, but that is not a bad thing, as it doesn't take much water to keep steam going) - the head of the mop is a good size and is very maneuverable in that you can twist it sideways and get into small spaces and under things - steam is produced and spread out more than in some other steam mops, which have just one hole where the steam is released and concentrated - the mopped areas dry quickly - I usually use the lower or mid settings and I find the floor is dry again within 5 minutes - I have not used the little flip down scrubbie brush because I haven't needed to: even with the gungy spots on my floor, passing over the spot a few times or allowing the steam to stay on that spot for a few seconds then swiping has been enough to remove the stubborn spots! - it comes with two pads - a regular and a scrubbier one - both work well. They both wash easily in the washing machine (do not use fabric softener and do not put in a drier!) - the pads have a little tag that sticks up and stays clean and dry - I do not have to touch anything dirty to remove the pad when I'm done cleaning! - the mop is very quiet - just a slight steam sound and a little clicking sound - the convenience level means I have cleaned my floors much more frequently than I ever did with any other method I've tried. With 2 cats, a dog, and 2 young kids my floors get dirty quickly. The mop gets used regularly and that means I \"push around\" less dirt when I do use it, so my floors are pretty darned clean! When I used other methods that were more difficult and time consuming, I did it less and my floors were a lot dirtier for that reason. - it stands on its own - no need to lean it against stuff in the closet CONs: this is a short list and really they are more or less \"wishes\" - the cord isn't that long which means I have to unplug and replug for each room, but then it doesn't get too cumbersome. I love rewind cords and that would be just awesome. - the \"fragrance disks\" are awful - they give you a couple free to try - UGH! hard to insert, makes your hands smell, the fragrance is overpowering and \"fake\" and probably not good for you, like most fragrances that aren't 100% natural. There's no point in those, if you ask me, so just skip them - the sticker that is on the control panel that shows the 3 levels of steam already pealed off on the corner - I pressed it back on, but I'm guessing that will need to be re-glued repeatedly - I've only used it 4 or 5 times. BOTTOM LINE: I've been very happy with this floor mop. It's simple and that is part of what makes it a good product and makes it more likely that I use it. I did buy another set of mop pads so I could change them as I go if I have particularly dirty floors. If you have a lot of tile, vinyl, laminate, and/or wood in your home, I highly recommend.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I purchased this a little over a month ago, to replace my dead Shark steam mop, which was actually the first Shark model to come out a few years back. As new companies came out with new models of steam mops, I knew that when I needed to replace that Shark, there would be better features available, and boy, was I right. After comparing a few models from different companies, I settled on the Bissell because of features and reviews. I am very happy with is so far! The elastic edged mop cloth stays on soooo much better than the velcro-type system on my old Shark -thank goodness for improvements! It can be a little tricky to get on, but I'm just thankful it doesn't come off during use. Also, I do have to let it cool for a while after using before removing the mop cloth, or it can be too hot to handle. I really like that the water tank is removable for filling. I am using distilled water to hopefully help it to last longer, because I'm pretty sure that using tap water is part of what killed my Shark. I just wish the tank could sit on the counter so I didn't have to hold it while filling, but the slanted top design keeps it from standing up on its own. The three levels of steam are great. The first time I used this, I used the highest steam level, because things had become pretty dirty around here without my Shark. The Bissell made everything clean and shiny again! I mopped the kitchen, dining room, front hall, a bathroom, and my office, all on high steam, and had a tiny bit of water left. The \"no steam\" level is great, too, because it won't keep steaming if I have to walk away. The handle is not adjustable, but I don't mind because it is easy to push, pull, and pivot. The weight of the actual unit helps me to get enough pressure for good floor scrubbing. The one thing that really gets me is that the cord is not very long. My vacuum has a longer cord than this mop. I have a lot of area that I steam mop, so this really comes into play for me, as I have to move the plug several times while doing everything. I am very happy with this Bissell, and all of the features that have improved since steam mops came onto the market a few years ago. It has definitely made the chore of cleaning my hardwood, tile, and stained concrete floors more pleasant!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "When my Shark Deluxe Steam Pocket Mop died after a year, I went on a hunt to find a replacement. I purchased the Haan SI-40 from Amazon first because of the great reviews and was not impressed at all. The Haan produced barely any steam. I could actually put my hand on the bottom where the steam was produced and it didn't feel too hot to touch. So I sent it back to Amazon today and stopped at a local store to try something else. Enter this little number. I'm very impressed with the amount of steam that was produced. Initially, it was a bit hard to push, but once the pad was wet enough, it moved more easily. I loved that you didn't have to pump the unit to produce steam like the Shark. I really liked my Shark, but this one is much better because the steam comes out constantly and it gets much hotter. Touching the bottom of this unit was impossible - ouch. A plus in my book! How the heck are you going to kill germs and bacteria with just warm water. I want it scorching! I went over the exact same floor that I had went over with the Haan the day before and wow - talk about dirty! This mop got up so much filth! LOVE IT! It just confirms what I thought - the Haan just isn't as good. I can't speak to the longevity yet but will stop back in a year or so and follow-up. NOTE: I tried my neighbors Hoover Twin Tanks and I like the Bissel better. The Hoover produced a good amount of steam, was very hot to the touch and was better than the Haan, but that trigger button was uncomfortable to hold the whole time. Keep in mind, I live in a townhouse where only the dining room and kitchen are laminate and hard wood - the square footage isn't much and that trigger was a pain. It also couldn't get into hard to reach places as well as the Bissel.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I LOVE THIS THING!!!! I was looking at The Shark, and the reviews were alright, but there were more 5 star reviews for the Bissel. SO glad I chose this one! My house is all tile floors, and to clean them with a Swiffer meant I had to set aside a whole DAY. I really had to work hard, switching pads and they woud clean small sections at a time. I tried traditional mops, but it felt like I wasn't getting the floor clean, with the dirty water and all. Plus that was work too! The water, the bucket, the mop, the drying, forget it. This guy is TIGHT!! Heats up fast, cleans GREAT, and the best party is how much TIME I've saved!!! My floors are clean all the time, cause it takes a few minutes to do, plus it's fun to use! The boiling of the water reminds me of my childhood popping dome vacuum toy :) The less reviews of this mop only had one complaint that it has no on/off switch. Who cares??! When you're done, you unplug it! Big deal. Bottom line. Cleans great. Dries fast. Heats up fast. Fun to use. Money saver (machine washable pads). Cleans large areas FAST. Very little effort for BIG cleaning pay off. You're done.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I've owned some type of Dustbuster/handvac for the last twenty years and I don't think I've ever ever had one that I didn't hate. Too little suction power, not enough charge time, the suction nozzle is awkward to use, and the batteries are always dead after a couple minutes. I can keep them plugged into the wall all the time, but that kills the battery and wastes electricity. I have found it much more effective to just use the suction hose on my upright, even though that means lugging my vacuum around. So I decided to see what is new in handvac technology and if they have improved at all over the last ten years. Fortunately, I can say that they have. The Black and Decker 14.4v Lithium Ion DustBuster is the same handvac as the Black & Decker CHV1410 Dustbuster 14.4-Volt Cordless Cyclonic Hand Vac except it contains a Lithium-Ion (LIB) battery, whereas the standard CHV1410 contains a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery. If you're trying to decide between the two devices, I would recommend this Lithium-Ion model due to the advantages of the battery: 1. Higher energy density - this means that the LIB battery can hold more energy per volume. In this case the CHV1410L holds about twice the amount of energy as the CHV1410. 2. Greater power density - this refers to bursts of power the battery is capable. It works well when combined with the higher energy density mentioned above. 3. No memory effect - this is something you might have noticed with a Ni-Cd battery. These batteries work best when you fully discharge the battery and then recharge it. With a Dustbuster, you're almost never going to do this. You'll use it for a few minutes then put it back on the mount to charge. This can sometimes product a memory effect, where the cadmium inside the battery forms crystals and the battery will hold less of a charge. A LIB battery does not experience a memory effect. 4. Non-toxic - Ni-Cd batteries are toxic and classified as hazardous. LiB aren't, so disposal is much better for the environment. LiB do have a couple small disadvantages, but in this application and with the frequent recharging the Dustbuster will see, I feel that it is definitely the right choice. Not to mention the toxicity factor alone makes me feel better about using this type of battery. USE AND OPERATION - I evaluated both the CHV1410L and the standard CHV1410 at the same time to see what the real difference was between the devices and how the battery affected them. The main thing I like about the CHV1410L does have to do with the battery. It will supposedly hold a charge for up to 18 months. I can't confirm if this is true, but the first time I had it, I gave it a full charge and then removed it from the power source and let it sit uncharged for 30 days. When I tried it out, it seemed to be completely charged and worked great. With my previous Dustbuster, it would have been dead after two days. I did the same 30 day test with the CHV1410. Although it did still have a powerful charge in it and seemed to work fine, I did notice it was less powerful than the CHV1410L. I tested this by putting two small Styrofoam balls in front of the Dustbusters at a specific distance, and then gradually moved the Dustbusters closer to the peanuts until they sucked them up. In repeated tests, the CHV1410L grabbed the ball slightly before the CHV1410, demonstrating more power. For the remainder of my use and testing, the two units performed the same. The main thing I noticed about using the Dustbuster is how powerful it is. I was not expecting much out of it, but it performed almost as well as my upright. It has a narrow opening on the front of it to concentrate more of the power. That little green piece on the end pulls out and extends the dustbuster so you can get in hard to reach places. This worked great for cobwebs and getting dust from under furniture like sofas and dressers. The crevice tool also has a small brush attached to it. I tried it out on a sofa covered in dog hair, but did not find that the brush helped much at all. It was just as easy to use it without the brush. The only way I see that the brush might be handy is for my ceiling fans, which allows me to press down on the crevice tool without pressing into the blade. Otherwise it's not very useful. CLEANING - The CHV1410L is very easy to clean. It's bagless, and uses a plastic filter. You just press in the tabs and it unlocks and you can shake it out into a trash can. One problem I did have with it is that dog hair seemed to collect in the filter holes and I had to pull these out by hand. But I've used a lot of bagless vacuums like this with these types of filters and I would say this is one of the easier ones to clean. Overall, I'm very happy with the CHV1410L and plan to use it for almost everything I was using my upright for, which will save me a lot of time not having to drag it out of the closet and plug it in. The only real negative I have with it is that it's fairly loud, which I guess is to be expected for something so powerful. UPDATE December 2013 - It's been almost two years and the battery on this Dust Buster is still going strong. I use it maybe twice a week for a total of about 30 minutes.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I have had several hand-held vacuum cleaners and Dustbusters over the years. They all had one glaring problem - the battery. Battery life is not very long on these devices, and that is to be expected, but once the battery is completely depleted (which if it is a NiCad, it should always be depleted), it takes many hours (sometimes an entire day) to recharge. And since you shouldn't recharge the battery unless it is completely depleted, you most often have a device that is never fully charged, and thus will only run for a few minutes at a time. This new Dustbuster eliminates that problem by using a Lithium-Ion battery. Not only does it hold a charge much longer, it recharges VERY quickly. Best of all, you can leave it in the charger all the time, so your Dustbuster is always fully charged and ready to go. And you don't have to wait until the battery is completely depleted either. Besides that great feature, virtually everything else (the extending nozzle, brush attachment, rotating nozzle) work perfectly. PROS: 1.Great battery (long lasting, no memory issue, quick recharge, leave in the charger so you always have a full charge). 2.Powerful suction 3.Very easy to empty and clean the dust bowl and filters - something other vacuums don't do well. The dust bowl is visible due to the clear plastic covering that area. 4.Good accessories - extending nozzle, flip-up brush, rotating nozzle work exactly as they should CONS: None at all. Black&Decker has finally made the perfect hand-held vacuum! Even the price is great - I bought it on sale at Home Depot for $67.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Once I received my \"new\" Lithium Ion Dust Buster, I have to agree with the majority of the reviews. This dust buster was well designed, easy to operate, great suction, easy to clean and most of all, the battery life is fantastic. I've had Nicad dust busters in the past and they just don't last very long and our most recent one the charger burned out. Right now, the only negative (and this has been pointed out by other reviewers) is the bright blue LED charging light. This light is flashing while in charge mode and steady when fully charged. It's best to keep this charger in a room where you won't see it if you're trying to sleep, eat or watch TV - a bit obnoxious. This light is too bright. A non-LED light would have made more sense. We can deal with the light issue so this product gets a full 5 stars. I would also recommend that Amazon make available the filter that goes with this hand vac. the one's shown do not fit this unit. From what I've seen so far, you can only get another filter through Black & Decker and there is no filter part number in the manual.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I've owned and used several older generation Dustbuters. This one is a totally new design. Since I was tired of weak vacuums with weak batteries, I splurged and went for the top-of-the-line model. Here are my key findings: 1. Suction is good for a battery powered vacuum; certainly better than older models. 2. The charging light is very bright. I hadn't anticipated getting a new nightlight, but that's what it is. 3. The front end of the vacuum often pops off in use. I make sure the two latches on the sides are engaged, but when you press the nozzle into something, like carpet, to suck up dirt, sometimes the nozzle just pops off and then the dirt dumps out! 4. The extendable nozzle is a joke. You pull it out and snap it in place and the moment it contacts something, it pushes right back in. Useless feature. 5. Battery life for a cleaning job seems fine. I've never yet had the vacuum lose power or even slow down. I only use it for tasks that run it a few minutes at a time, but that was the outer limit for the older units. All in all, a mixed bag. Fundamentally good suction and battery life, but quirky \"features.\"", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I have owned many similar items (haven't we all!?), and I have been waiting for the Lithium battery to arrive! It eliminates the worst part about dust busters with nicad rechareable batteries - you only use them sporadically, you leave them plugged in all the time, and the battery soon loses most of its functionality. When you really need it to suck hard for a while, it poops out just when you need it not to! The new design is easy enough to use and the battery is GREAT! Note that the \"ready and charged\" light is very bright. Don't plan on storing it near your bed. It makes for a great night light in the pantry.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "--Just a quick update to my original review below: We've owned the dust buster for about a year now. We use it pretty much daily, mainly for cleaning up after the cats, and it continues to perform flawlessly. I definitely recommend this item highly.-- We purchased this dust buster a month ago for spot vacuuming cat fur, cleaning up kitty litter around the cat box, and general household use. We've been very pleased with all aspects of this product and highly recommended it. A few quick notes after reading other reviews. A number of people complain about how bright the recharging light is on on the handle of the vacuum. We have ours in the kitchen so that's not an issue for us, but if that bothers you, just put a piece of tape over the light. Masking tape or electrical tape will definitely solve the problem for a total cost of less than a penny. At least one person said that the crevice tool doesn't stay extended and needs a locking mechanism. Initially I thought the same thing, but you just need to pull the tool harder when extending it. It'll click it place and lock just fine.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I NEVER write reviews, but thought that it might be a good idea to start, since lately I have been using so many reviews to help make my household purchases. I looked at several different '\"dust busters\" and read tons of reviews before purchasing this one. I've had it about a month now and I absolutely love it! It holds a charge for a very long time, is powerful enough to suction up all the messes my kids make, and I like that I can just empty it and not worry about buying replacement anything. I have 2 toddlers and they are quite possibly the messiest kids on the planet. I use my dust buster a million times a day for little messes and about 3 times a day for a good once over of the high traffic areas of the house. It picks up whole pieces of cereal with no problem. Trix and Cocoa Puffs don't even get stuck in the nozzle area. It even managed to suck up a Dum Dum the other day! We visit my parents each Sunday and the kids were always making messes with snacks all over their house, so now we just grab the dust buster on our way out the door and take it with us. It keeps its charge while we're there all day and makes cleaning up after them so much easier. Some reviews I read complained about the noise level, but it doesn't bother me. I guess if you were gonna vacuum the crumbs out of your bed while your husband/wife slept, it wouldn't be ideal, but I seriously don't have a problem with the noise. It's a vacuum, one wouldn't expect it to be quiet. Another complaint was about the charging light on it being so bright. It is very bright, but my base is plugged in just inside my kitchen pantry, so it's not an issue for me. I wouldn't recommend putting it in a bedroom or anything, as it is rather bright and flashes while recharging. To me, neither the noise or charge light present even the slightest problem.

Like many others, I bought this model for the lithium battery. Although some do not like the counter recharging base, I like it since it is mobile and I can easily recharge in whatever area indoors or outdoors. The only downside is it is noisy just like any vacuum cleaner. Another B&D benefit is the 2 year warranty when all other handheld vacs I've bought were only one year.

As soon as it arrived on my door step, I opened it up and put it on the charger. Within a half hour it indicated it was fully charged and I put it to work and boy was I impressed. I ran it for about 8 minutes straight and it never even showed any signs of slowing down. The suction is alot stronger than my previous handvac and it picks up alot of dirt.

{"review": "I am a veterinary technician at a small animal clinic. When our central vac system malfunctioned our office manager picked up this machine to use until repairs could be made. I was completely amazed by this light-weight, easy to maneuver vac. Hair, toenail clippings, dirt all gone! We've tried other stick vacs at the clinic and they usually just push the hair and nails around the floor, or they clog up in seconds. This vac is so impressive that I ran out and bought one for my 6 cat, 3 dog, 1 baby house. This vac has a ridiculously large amount of suction for it's size. The suction power, together with the odd looking but highly effective v-shape front edge, pulls the hair and dirt into the vac rather than pushing it around. It's hard to overstate the \"Wow!\" factor involved as it cleans right up to the baseboards, under the cupboard edges, pulls hair from corners and around chair legs. (I'd been using the edging tool on my large upright vac to do the same things--heavy, took more time, and didn't clean as well!) All that in a light-weight vac that can be picked up one handed without a thought. I've been zipping this around at home on our vinyl and laminate floors while carrying my infant daughter in her baby sling. Emptying the vac is simple and doesn't make a mess. Yet another great feature is the absence of bristles. Everyone who deals with pet hair quickly learns that bristles are just spots for the hair to collect and drag around the house rather than going into the vac. Someone at Bissell was doing their homework. The only downside to this vac is the noise. It is loud. Very loud.

The only cons are: the cord isn't as long as a regular carpet vacuum, you have to get used to how it maneuvers, and it fills up quick (however, I had TONS of pet hair to collect for the first time use. Just started using it today). Someone had commented that it was loud, but I didn't think it was any louder than a regular vacuum. I actually think it was a little quieter. Overall, I am very satisfied with this vacuum and wish I had gotten it a long time ago.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "We really like this vacuum. We have two dogs and a cat with ceramic tile and this vacuum works very well on the tile floor. We also live in a dusty rural area that the dogs bring inside our home. This machine is easy to maneuver around the furniture and along the baseboards. It gets up all of the hair from our shedding Rottweiler who sheds all year. Drawbacks: > The cord is too short. I would like to see a 25 foot cord. > The filters and separator clog up very quickly. The separator and foam filter are easy to wash out. The pleated paper filter can be knocked clean, but will have to be replaced. The foam with pleated filter are purchased for $10. Bissell 54A2 PowerEdge Filter Replacement Pack Personally, I would prefer a bag to the filter. They are easy to access, though. > The small dust cup fills up quickly, but it is easy to remove and dump out. > No provision for a hose or attachments. As easy as it is in getting to the corners, there are still places that you need a crevice tool on a hose to access. We have to pull out the upright to use the hose to get those locations. Positives: > Great suction as long as you keep it cleaned out. The separator clogs quickly with hair. > Very lightweight and the swivel makes it easy to get around and under furniture. > Corded-you don't have to worry about the battery going dead. > The \"V\" shape does a very good job in channeling the dirt and hair into the intake port on the bottom. We have clogged the hole a couple of times. > Tilts easily and the bottom foot is low profile which fits just about anywhere. > The motor is quieter than our upright. > Does not throw hair and dirt around the room like an upright. This is a handy vacuuming tool for hard floors and well worth $50. However, it cannot replace a canister or upright to get the out of the way places reached only by a hose with attachments.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Pros: This vacuum has great suction and I like the container that collects the dirt. It's easy to dump and I like not dealing with a filter. I like how the Bissell stands up which my other stick vacs did not do and the cord is a nice length. Cons: I wish it had a hose so I could get the baseboards but I really don't like the design of the base. It is too clumsy to get around in the bathroom (particularly around toilet) or to do the basement steps. I also have trouble around my rugs although it is great when the rugs are up and the floors are bare. For the designers out there I loved a stick vac I had with a trianglular shape but have not been able to find one particularly with a hose.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "When I first opened this, it struck me as a bit cheap looking (and, well, it is cheap!), but it went together easily and performed well. The cord is about 20 feet, I'd guess, long enough, but could be longer. The thing works like a charm and once you get used to it, can maneuver into fairly tight spots (like around toilets in bathrooms). It's no good on carpet, of course, but on hard surfaces it is great. No scratches on my tile floor. Easy to do edges and corners and under things. Nice cord holder/guide on handle and quick release cord holder on body. It's about as loud as any other vacuum to me. It would be more convenient to have the on/off switch up on the handle rather than the body, but they had to save money and it's not a big deal. For $50 this is a very good value, I think (if it holds up). 2011-09-23 - Still going strong. I continue to like this and think it is a great value.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "We have four small dogs and two cats, and our home is approximately half tile, half carpet. I've gone through quite a few hard floor vacuums over the years, and have yet to find one that's perfect. Last summer we found ourselves fostering six kittens temporarily, in addition to all of our other furry family members, and our little Bissel 3-in1 Vac was no match for the chaos. After two weeks of lugging out the big vacuum multiple times per day to clean up cat litter with the hose attachment, I knew we were in need of a better solution. Obviously we have a lot of pet hair, but most vacuums can handle this with ease. Where we've always ran into problems is with the heavier stuff, like dog food and cat litter. The Bissell PowerEdge Pet has NO PROBLEM with picking up dog food and cat litter! It's powerful! Its canister is plenty big, the vacuum is lightweight, the cord is long enough for the average-sized room, and it's easy to empty when necessary. The filters are easy to change, the \"blower\" part is in a decent spot, and I've had zero problems with hair clogging the device. I also love that it can stand on its own, so I never have to balance it against walls. But, despite all its pros, I absolutely hate this vacuum's shape. I've read other reviews that say it just takes time to get used to the triangular base, but I've vacuumed with this vacuum almost daily for nine months now and I just don't see it happening. Sure, it can pick up anything in its path. But its path is very limited. It's extremely awkward to maneuver around furniture legs or areas with curves. Getting behind toilets is impossible, which makes this vacuum worthless in our bathrooms. To vacuum corners, you have to run the vacuum along each wall separately, which is quite the feat if you have furniture, appliances, or doors along those walls. Would I purchase this vacuum again? Absolutely. I DO use it daily, and it's the only hard floor vacuum I've ever owned that didn't require at least three trips over the laundry room floor to pick up all the cat litter. While fostering the six kittens I mentioned earlier, we had a total of eight cats and four litter boxes. I was vacuuming two to three times a day, and this vacuum had ZERO issues (except for those pesky corners). It picks up dog food just as easily as it did on Day 1. It's made my life easier for sure! BUT, I still have to use a second vacuum for corners and tight spaces, and considering this is the only hard floor vacuum I've ever owned that didn't fit behind a toilet, I consider this a major flaw.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I've never ever reviewed an item before, but I just HAD to speak up about this amazing vacuum. If you are a pet owner, this is a MUST HAVE. I have a black lab who sheds a TON and with hardwood floors/tile, it shows up immediately, but a quick run around with this vacuum its ALL gone. I never found a vacuum that i liked because most of them push around the hair or can't pick up 100% of the time, but this one had me putting my broom, dust mop, AND swiffer away into the closet bc its just that good. It has an easy to empty container with a swivel head for hard to reach corners. It gets EVERYWHERE. I almost went crazy cleaning up after my crazy shedding dog, but this is making it totally manageable. THANK YOU BISSELL!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I have had this for a few months now. LOVE it for my hard wood floors. I have a black lab the seems to shed non stop and also manages to drag in a lot of dirt, grass clippings and any other mess she can manage. Vacuum does a great job of getting all that up. I use it on rugs also. Doesn't do the best job on rugs, and I certainly would not use it in carpeting, but it is not intended for use on those surfaces. It does do an OK job on throw rugs but when I need a thorough job on those, I just bring out my regular vacuum. The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is because it is in need of a much longer cord. I am always moving to different outlets but that could always be remedied by using an extension cord. Great vacuum for the money and certainly does a great job on hard floor surfaces.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "The best pet hair and litter vacuum I have found. I have spent hundreds of dollars on hard floor machines, having around 3000 sq feet of tile and stained concrete. I have a parking lot in my laundry room of special brooms, dust mops, dry and wet cleaners, and promising vacuums. Some are worthless and some help a little, but this is the only one that will pick up the acres of fluffy pet hair I have floating around my house, particularly during the twice yearly shedding season. It doesn't blow it away and the weird v-shaped head actually makes it so easy to get around table legs and corners. Since their is no beater bar it doesn't suck up other power cords, so you can actually run it over the computer cord under the desk and it sucks up all the hair that seems to collect there. It is also great for sucking up loose cat litter and doesn't leave the little line of debris like a broom and dust pan. Even though it is not meant for carpets, it works fine for average cleaning on short pile area rugs. It is so definitely worth the money. I was sceptical but can easily admit it is the best hard floor cleaning machine I have tried. With Amazon, the price was fantastic, even though it came brand new from Target and delivered right to my door so I didn't have to face the crowds and lug it home.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I've read all the reviews and I'm here to clean up those who have trash-talked this dustbuster. I do not work for Black & Decker or Amazon.com. I also do not hold any stock or interest in the aforementioned companies, but I do have an interest in spending my money wisely. So, when other consumers write misinformed, misguided, inaccurate portrayals of a product that is otherwise perfect, I feel the need to scrub their comments until all the residue is gone. Here's what I found: To begin with, no rechargeable hand-held vacuum is designed to last anywhere near an hour without recharging, and no rechargeable item with such a large battery pack will recharge in mere minutes. So, for those who make this claim, they are silly-heads. For the reviews that state it only operates between a few seconds and a few minutes, you obviously have a rare lemon. I'm quite certain B&D would not knowingly produce a 30-second dustbuster. Quit complaining and exchange it. As a side note, for those who wish to dustbust their entire fleet of autos, B&D as well as other manufacturers sell hand-held vacuums with cigarette lighter receptacle plugs that are powered by your vehicle. Those will last you until your car battery dies. Otherwise, quit being lazy and pull out the wet/dry vac, we all know a dustbuster isn't going to completely clean that Brillo-style vehicle carpet anyway. Second, at just over three pounds (not the 4.6 pounds of the entire box + contents), the reviewers who wrote that this appliance was too heavy must be drunk... which for comparison, your average bottle of wine weighs more than this dustbuster. Also, the guy who claimed he got a hand cramp after using the dustbuster a few minutes probably needs to pull out the full-sized vacuum in order to develop some muscular endurance. I, for one, would not readily admit this weakness on one of the most popular consumer websites. Third, I don't know why people are \"scrubbing\" surfaces with their dustbuster. I was under the impression that it was a vacuum cleaner, not a rag, sponge, or scouring pad. If your \"scrubbing\" causes the extension to retreat back into the nozzle sheath, then quit riding your dustbuster like a pogo-stick. This nozzle has a locking mechanism at the base. Go look at it. You see it now... that little arrow... push down on it. Wow! Amazing! I've tested it using my bathroom scale. It takes more than 25 pounds of direct pressure, yes 25 POUNDS, to override that lock. If you can't figure out this simple device, you should probably not be using any electrical piece of equipment. Next, this model has one of the highest rated suction power of all battery operated hand-held vacuums. This is one of the main reasons it was given such high marks by Consumer Reports (again, I have no ties to this company). If you can't pick it up with the 15.6V of power provided, then it was never designed to be picked up by a hand-held vac. Finally, not that this is even worth mentioning, but for those who complained about the charging method... really? It's the same as every other rechargeable item that you probably now own. Take \"Adaptor A\" and plug it into \"Port B.\" Not that hard. But there are so many people that have complained that the recharging prong is no longer built into the docking bracket. Oh, the humanity! As I stated in my opening, I am very particular about how my money is spent. I compared and tested all the available models I could find during a month-long search and feel the $45.00 spent on this dustbuster has been well worth the price thus far. Good luck on your search, and remember, it's a dustbuster, not a teleportation device. Don't expect your science-fiction dreams to come true while you're cleaning up cookie crumbs. If you still feel like complaining, pull out the old broom, dustpan, sponge, and bucket... cleaning the old-fashioned way will be the only thing that sucks better than this dustbuster (pun intended).

{"review": "I picked this up locally at Target because I wanted to be able to return it just in case it sucked at sucking. After having this for a month now, for about $50, you really can't go wrong with this. We brought our newborn home a month ago and I wanted to have something around to be able to pick up the cat+dog fur tumbleweeds around the house and generally keep it a bit cleaner. Our full size vacuum weighs some 15+lbs and it's just too heavy and cumbersome to bust out for daily quick cleanups. PROS: + Lightweight and easy to handle; well balanced + Powerful suction - the Dyson handhelds must be off the charts because this is already pretty strong as it is + Power toggle stays on + On-board attachments + Holds its charge very well - perfect for cleaning around the house and on the stairs - haven't had it lose charge on me mid-cleanup yet and it holds its charge for 2-3 passes for me. Charge time really isn't an issue since I don't plan on using it for extended periods of time in the first place. CONS: - Fur can be difficult to remove from the dustbin - it doesn't just come right out. I need to stick my fingers up there; yuck - The built-in extension wand doesn't stay up with aggressive use. B&D could have easily solved this with a simple latch mechanism for a few cents more. - Can't take other attachments, which wouldn't really be a problem except... - Extension wand is too short. I'm average height and I need to bend down to use it. It wouldn't be so bad if it could accept attachments that would extend it to allow usage from a standing position but as it is, you'll probably spend a lot of time hunched over It should be noted that we have hardwood throughout so the full sized vacuum rarely gets used now except for the area rugs. Overall, the house is slightly cleaner now simply due to more frequent vacuuming of the dog and cat fur rolling around the ground. A great value at about $50 and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it or recommend it. That said, there are definitely a few small fixes that the B&D engineers could add to make this a 5 star product. ============================== UPDATE: Now that the price has dropped well below $50, I think this is a CAN'T MISS product. Seriously, it's one powerful handheld vacuum for not a whole lot of money; you literally CAN NOT go wrong with this purchase (unless you're old or have lower back problems I guess...). I've also figured out that it's a LOT easier to empty the bin by removing the motor part (you can unmount the motor or the wand; if you unmount the motor part and remove the filter, everything just slides right out of the collection bin). Giant, massive balls of cat and dog fur mostly just slides right out. If you're worried about the charge time or the smallish collection bin, at this price? Buy two and you're good to go and you're still saving WAAAAY more than buying a Dyson! Whatever shortcomings it has, they can be forgiven at this price point for the sheer convenience of having such a powerful little vacuum around. I've used it for several months and I can't imagine how we went so long lugging around the gigantic full-sized vacuum for daily cleanups! ============================== UPDATE 2/14: We've used it for almost 3 years now and the battery is now starting to wear out. It doesn't hold a charge and immediately loses suction. It's disappointing that it seems that the battery cannot be replaced as it means that I have to junk the whole unit when only the battery is done for. We've since added another Li-Ion Dustbuster and a Dyson DC59 as well. I would still recommend this unit, but B&D would be wise to design it so that the battery can be replaced (or offer some sort of exchange program?)", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "An excessive compulsive clean-freak woman had to have had her hand in designing this vac. On a scale of 1-10 it's an 11! Thank you Black and Decker for coming out with the 1st cordless hand vac with the power of a corded one. It is so darn handy yet gets the job done. Need I say more? Yes, I do. The fact that all I have to do to get into my deep crevices or to use the brush is pull out the tools (instead of hunt for them in my closet) right on the nozzle is absolutely ingenious! Oh and that vented, hard plastic sleeve that goes over the washable filter - well, it's just clever. No more crud sticking to the filter to clog things up. t just slides right off!!!! You people at Black and Decker that designed this one deserve a huge raise! Finally, a GREAT hand vac! I love, love, love it! It's perfect. You thought of EVERYTHING. Well, almost everything.

{"review": "We are very hard on our cordless hand vacs--they get carted all around our house by our energetic boys, and used to pick up everything from dirt to insects to sweepings from the floor. I'm impressed by the power of this vacuum, and have been pleased with how easy it is to keep clean. It comes apart into 3 pieces pretty easily--a nozzle area, the main cannister area, and the motorized portion. This makes it a snap to get things clean and to empty into the trash. I like the fact that the brush portion is attached to the front nozzle, so I don't have to look for it when my kids cart the vacuum away. It folds out and snaps into place, very handily and easily. The machine is not too light and not too heavy. The charging mechanism plugs into the handle, and there is a simple light to tell you it is charging. On the whole, I prefer this over a charger into which the machine slides, like a couple of my older vac's have. I'm considering purchasing a second one of these excellent machines.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "We live in the country - Dusty and spiders - lots of spiders. Our spiders are normal spiders types (defining normal loosely). However, we've got more of them than city folks, lots more and everyone of them spins webs. Not only do they spin webs, but they abandon them after a time and spin more. Add to that an older home with textured ceilings and you've got \"ugly\" - ugly in every corner. We've tried everything including vacuum cleaners (you lift it with one arm and clean the ceiling with the other - till your arms give out). Then along comes this little Black & Decker Dustbuster Black & Decker CHV1510 Dustbuster 15.6-Volt Cordless Cyclonic Hand Vacuum. It's a hand vacuum with some pretty good recommendations so what the heck - we brought it. WOW!. Honestly, we've got an upright, a canister, a shop vac and a cheap hand held that came as a gift one Christmas and none work even remotely as well. This came after a days worth of charging as I set out to bust the webs. And bust the webs it did. This little guy is powerful enough to strip a web from the ceiling and the spider with it (sorry about what follows, but we shoot a little bug spay down it's throat, with the motor off, when we're done). Anyway, I finished all three bedrooms, three bathrooms, living room, dining room, kitchen, some plants, a fireplace made from lava stones in one session. I did that and a small area where our toddler grandson had breakfast and it was still running as hard as it was when I started. When I was done so were the spiders and their webs and it sounded like it had plenty of charge left. Cleanup was the second best thing about this vacuum because everything comes apart easily, is hard plastic and washable. It's not only easy to break down but nearly foolproof to put back together again. I also liked (as did many) the attached features since I can't imagine ever finding them again if I had to store them. If I have any negatives and it's minor at best - it's a bit hefty (weight wise) but I'm not sure that is a complaint so much as me exceeding my limits cleaning all the ceilings in one session.

{"review": "This is hands-down the best Dustbuster ever designed. I've been a avid Dustbuster enthusiast since they started making them decades ago. Every few years I upgrade to a new model and usually appreciate the new features and increased power. But this year I hit the jackpot with the CHV1510. The suction is terrific for its size, the batteries and voltage deliver long-lasting performance per charge -- the longest EVER!! -- and the totally redesigned body and features make this one awesome little tool. Suction and long-lasting power are always first on my list, but a close second is ease of cleaning, and the CHV1510 takes the cake for clean-ability. The clear waste-barrel comes off with a click and BOTH ends open up so you can thoroughly clean the barrel. The filter and pre-filter are well designed, work great, and they are ALSO easy to clean. Other features that finally make me totally happy with a Dustbuster are (1) an on-off switch that is actually easy to work with a flick of my thumb; (2) an excellent design for an on-board crevice tool that simply slips out instantly, ready for use and then retracts with the touch of a finger; (3) an on-board brush that flips down and locks in place when needed, (4) a narrower front-end nozzle that makes it far easier to get into tight spaces than any previous Dustbuster model, and (5) the front-end nozzle rotates with push-button ease to change the angle for easier maneuvering. This is without a doubt the best designed Dustbuster ever produced. And it WORKS!! If anybody from Black & Decker reads this, I'd like to pass on one single tip to make the next version of this fantastic tool even better. The wall-mount bracket is fine and functional as is, but one improvement would be to make it a little larger so there would be room on the underside to wrap up all the unneeded power-charger-cord and keep it out of the way. I loved this model so much I bought 4 of them and retired all my old Dustbusters. I have a big house and several dogs and keep one handy in every traffic area in the house so I can easily keep up with dog hair and miscellaneous specks they track into the house endlessly. If I could give the Dustbuster CHV1510 twice as many stars, I would.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I've read all the good and bad review and did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this unit. I can say I am not disappointed at all. Most of the stuff people write in negative reviews I have found not to be true. Its almost like they are very dissatisfied with the product for whatever reason and start making up stuff. For example: 1. the \"eject\" button is too close to \"on\" button. Yeah its true but I have NEVER pushed the eject button on the accident as it is pretty far out there, to push it you really have to know what you want to push. And I have long fingers too. 2. The sliding part slides back when I vacuum. Not true at all, if you make sure it locks in, it will not slide, in order to retract it you have to squeeze it in the middle right where it locks. 3. The unit doesnt even work for 5 minutes. Mine stayed on for 15 minutes before any loss in power. And you have to remember, this vac is powerful and runs 15.6 volt, if you want to vacuum for half an hour buy a corded one. 4. It has no suction. Actually it has lots of suction and up to this point I was always able to vacuum everything I tried. 5. Couldnt even vacuum out my car. I did vacuum out my car and the trunk and still had charge left. I can keep going on and on but instead I will just summarize everything in a few following short paragraphs. People, you are buying a $50 piece of equipment, but expect it to work like $1000 piece of equipment. I can say that this vacuum is perfect for cleaning up small messes my kids make. If I had a choice of going to Buffalo Wild Wings (<--substitute your favorite place here) with my family once and spending $50 in one hour on food I will dispose of the next day, or buying this handy vac that saved my carpet, tile and time on numerous occasions, I would definitely go with the vacuum that already lasted me 2 months. And all that for $50? You just cant beat it. I cannot stress this enough, keep your expectations to an average and you will definitely be satisfied, just remember the value of this purchase; $50 can last you at least a year with this vac or a few hours if you decide to take your family out to eat.

{"review": "The directions say it can be left charging when not in use, so I do. That was one of the reasons I purchased this hand vac.

{"review": "I bought this because of the increased power. Unfortunately, it has other shortcomings: Noise - This is a lot like working around an unshielded jet engine. Much louder and high frequency \"scream\" than other Dustbusters I have used. Ear protection would be advised. Stamina - The upside to the noise problem is that it doesn't last long - A full overnight charge will get you no more 5 minutes of use before it is completely discharged and the batteries dead. At about the 2 minute mark, the noise and suction begin to fall until it fades completely to black about 3 minutes later. I managed to vacuum the cargo bed of my SUV; The front and rear seating areas had to wait as the Dustbuster had gone on break. Charging cradle - none. just a wall bracket to hold it The charger is completely separate. Nozzle - it has a slide out nozzle at the mouth that will not stay locked in if you push rather than pull across carpeting. The constant collapsing means a frequent loss of reach. If you can live with it being permanently extended, duct tape should do the trick. Bottom line: If you are deaf, and need a hand vacuum with two minutes of great suction - this will do the trick.

{"review": "Two cats and two fabric-covered couches, can you feel my pain? After a while, I was going nuts. I'd go broke buying the adhesive type lint rollers, the rubber ones (search for \"sweepa\") and the reusable brush type didn't do the job. All I'd heard about was dysons, dysons, dysons, so I started saving. But then I thought, hey, what I want is the little motorized roller brush attachment -- so I got online, started searching, and found this. I figured $40 as opposed to $500 was worth a try, especially with the good reviews. and it *was*. It gets all the cat hair off my couch, and the nice thing is that the hose just tugs right out and you can also get the little cracks and crevices without missing a beat. The \"riser visor\" thing, I thought was kinda silly til I started using it -- and it's great. You can vacuum horizontally and vertically, and for furniture, stairs, etc--a great feature. My only complaint is that it's just a *bit* heavy, especially for longer use. Wears that arm out, but that can be a good thing, too.

{"review": "'Caveat emptor' should be a caution against not just unscrupulous sellers, but misguided buyers as well, a self-warning of sorts. To that end, I read all ~1600 reviews of the Eureka, paying special heed to the three percent or so that awarded it one star. Call this a meta review. My conclusion after a complex and detailed statistical and psychological analysis of the complaints is that the hand-held vacuum was being misused, abused in some cases. After a few months of use, I agree with all the positives: Eureka is powerful & easy to use, the brush enhances cleaning power, the canister is a snap to empty, and the filter creates a nice, tight seal. As for the complaints... \"Vacuum stopped working after X uses/N years.\" That was the predominant complaint, sparks and smoke and vacuum broke. Many of the reviewers who sent their Eurekas to the Great Vacuum too soon seemed to be using them as replacements for full-sized vacuum cleaners: three flights of stairs, several area rugs, hotel lobbies, etc. I planned to use mine to clean up the occasional kitchen spill and kitty-litter dusting--no sucking marathons, just little sprints here and there. Could there have been honestly defective units among these? Sure! I mean, the FDA allows for up to 60 insect fragments per 3.5 oz of chocolate, so a defect in three out of every 1000 Eurekas is nothing to get all huffy and litigious about. \"Vacuum is too heavy.\" Again, an easy-to-dismiss complaint for me. Step 1: read product specs and ascertain that product weighs 7 pounds. Step 2: lift a bag of potatoes to get a feel for what 7 pounds is like. Step 3: conclude that I can hold seven pounds for the thirty seconds or so it will take me to clean up the flour and popcorn that have peppered the kitchen floor. Step 4: be pleasantly surprised that the 7 pounds referred to the shipping weight, and that the Eureka sans box weighs (according to my bathroom scale) a featherlight 5.4 pounds. Step 5: determine that if the Eureka were a bar of chocolate, then the FDA would be OK if it contained up to 1500 insect fragments. \"Vacuum blows dust everywhere.\" This was perhaps the most serious of the warnings that I read. After all, vacuums need to exhaust all that air somewhere, and I have noticed this issue with some uprights, especially on hardwood & tile floors. I took solace in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, especially those that addressed the suck-and-blow issues. In particular, one reviewer noted that the vacuuming should be done by pushing the Eureka away from you and not towards you since the exhaust was stronger under the Eureka's belly. That's how I vacuum anyway--plus, I identified, since the exhaust is stronger under my belly as well--so I took a chance. So far, there has been no exhaust problem, no blowing stuff around. \"Power cord is hard to store.\" As I see it, there are four options for power cord management. Option one: get a cordless handheld vacuum, put up with weaker suction, leave unit constantly charging and sucking power, replace batteries every couple of years once they reach the end of their recharge cycle. Option two: get a short-corded handheld vacuum and plan to spill beans only near electrical outlets. Option three: get one of those internal-storage crank widgets that are a pain to operate or else spring-loaded with an angry and temperamental spring. Option four: to store, wrap the long cord around the base in the time that it takes you to say wrap wrap wrap wrap wrap wrap wrap wrap wrap. \"Hose suction is weak.\" Nope, it's strong. The same motor powers both the hose and the main unit. And the hose is ridiculously easy to use, requiring none of the attach/detach acrobatics of most vacuums. \"Vacuum requires screwdriver to turn on.\" This must have been written by Edward's younger brother, Johnny Screwdriverhands. \"Vacuum doesn't work in Australia.\" Well that settles it then: I'm not moving to Australia.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I'd planned to get the small Dyson, but the reviews of this vacuum persuaded me to give it a try. It's absolutely excellent. It's the best handheld vacuum I've ever tried, and I've thrown more of these things away than I can remember. Fortunately, I've always saved the attachments. Sometimes they fit another model, sometimes they don't. Since there's no fancy coupling required to attach tools to the hose end of this one, its just friction, most fit it. This is a solid, powerful vacuum. The filter is heavy-duty and seems very durable. It's easily removed and reattached. I use those over-priced compressed air duster cans to blow all the dust and dog hair off of the filter. Between this and my full-size Dyson, there's probably more of the family dog outside the house than in by now. As for the weight of this machine, it is a little heavy, but then I only have to support its weight when doing vertical surfaces or carrying it around. When it's vacuuming stairs and furniture, I let the horizontal surfaces support most of the weight. Everything about this machine suggests its maker really put a lot of thought and effort into making an absolutely excellent product. And, I commend them for packaging it in protective plastic that can be easily removed without knives, pliers, bolt cutters, or a chain saw. The engineering on this one was obviously thoughtful and thorough.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I wish I could give \"4 & 1/2\" stars for this eureka hand-held, because it really is a great vacuum. Great: -has really strong & powerful suction -long cord (25 feet!) -super stretchy hose with convieniently located crevice tool attachment -brushroll on/off control -riser visor great for those akward places -holds a good amount of dirt in it's bagless bin -automatically shuts off if motor is too hot to avoid overheating, (hasn't happened with mine yet, only use it for about 10 minutes at a time.) Trade-offs: -pretty dang big and a little heavy for a hand-held vac, but its great power & suction make it an even trade-off. -it isn't cordless, but most cordless vacs die in a year or two, not a problem with this guy! Not as great: -emptying is a bit messy, and you should use a bristle brush to clean off the filter as well as you can when empying. -the prongs in the plug seem too small, it will fall out of an outlet with the weakest pull.

I am so impressed with this tiny guy that I'm buying one for my mom! This is great for the couch and dusty furniture! And I love how it plugs in and doesn't \"charge\" on batteries.

{"review": "We bought this vacuum after reading the rave reviews here. It has both good and bad points. It works well on stairs. The visor flipping feature does a really good job at cleaning the risers. We bought it primarily to clean the cars, and there, it's not that great. Most car seats are a little curved for comfort, and the head doesn't reach the parts that dip below it (it's fairly wide). If you use the hose, you will rapidly find it very short - you have to bring the vacuum to about 1' of the area you are cleaning. It does do well in flat areas, such as the trunk, but the nooks and crannies are hard to get with the large head, and a real chore with the short hose/tiny crevice tool combo. Overall, I am not unhappy with its cleaning power. However, I find the noise level bordering on deafening if I use it for more than 10 or 15 minutes. The last time I cleaned the car, I found myself longing for some earplugs, and I think I'll use some next time. Since the hose is so short, you never can really get away from the noisy vacuum motor, so cleaning will definitely not be as therapeutic as you might wish!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "We bought this hand vac after our hand held powerhead attachment broke on our Sears canister unit, and our Dirt Devil was relegated to auto use. The old DD was so loud that we used ear plugs, and was just okay in the power dept. We were fairly happy with the old DD, so we bought another. Mistake! We didn't realize that the brush roller was beltless...powered by the incoming air. Any pressure on the roller and it stopped. Returned it promptly to the store. We did more research at Amazon and bought the Eureka. This one works well. We share our home with 4 cats and so far, this vac handles it well. My wife is not an occasional cleaner. She keeps the house spotless and goes thru poorly made vacs like water. The 71AV vac picks up cat hair well, even on course fabrics. It has impressive suction, even when compared to bigger vacs. Even so, it's much quieter than the Dirt Devil we had. The only thing that prevents a 5 star rating is the weight...5 lbs. Also, we have not proven the durability yet. Time will tell. Summary: GOOD: Great suction, strong brush roller, convenient cord wrap, quiet. NOT THAT GOOD: A little heavy, a little hard to clean around the filter, unproven durability (wife WILL test it!) Update 4/2012: This vac suddenly became afflicted with the dreaded smell of roasted electrical parts, and while it's still working, had to be relegated to outside use because of the smell. We will probably get another just like it. Six and a half years is decent for a vacuum of this price.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I'm shocked at how well this little vacuum works. After vacuuming with my expensive German-made vacuum, I used this machine over the same area. I could not believe how much dog hair and dust this handheld unit picked up! I did one bedroom floor and had to empty the handheld canister four times. Besides the suction power, the things I like best in this vacuum are the attached hose and clever storage for the crevice tool (inserted into the base of the vacuum). I also really like the flip up guard over the roller that lets you get the vertical rise on the stairs without having to do contortions. The only thing I think could have been done better is the handle. A more ergonomic design would be more comfortable----especially since I am going a little nuts with it now on the entire house.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "If your new machine LEAKS, see note #2 below. I am just amazed at how many people write that their machine leaked from day one, and they returned it. It will leak if you skip a crucial one-time set-up step. Paid $170 at Best Buy. This is my first carpet cleaner so I have nothing to compare it to except my own expectations. Even though the name is SteamVac, like all the others in this class of cleaners, there is no Steam to it. That's just false marketing, but all the manufacturers do it, so no particular knock on Hoover. First, let me say I'm ashamed to admit that our carpet hadn't been cleaned in 4 years, and that we live in the country where lots of dirt gets tracked in from outside. So the carpet was pretty darn dirty. The Hoover F5914-900 did a very nice job the first time I used it - a drastically noticeable difference in the appearance of the carpet. The water in the dirty water receptacle was black. Did it return the carpet to new condition? No, impossible. Did it take another treatment or two to really get it clean? Yes, that is the price I pay for ignoring wet-cleaning the carpet for years. One of this cleaner's best features is the ability to dry the carpet quite thoroughly. Since the front of the machine is made of clear plastic, you can see when you're vacuuming up water. If you want to dry the carpet as much as possible, keep vacuuming until you no longer see water being pulled up. As time has passed, the SteamVac has done an excellent job of maintaining my carpets. My only gripe is that the dirty water container fills up too quickly and should be a little bigger. Ideally, the dirty water receptacle \"should\" be full right as you run out of clean water. Then, you shut down, empty the dirty water, refill the clean water and back to work. But this process gets out-of-sync with the dirty water receptacle filling up before you run out of clean water. So this can be a little inconvenient, but not a show-stopper. The machine is well constructed but it IS plastic, with lots of compartments and latches and hose holders, etc, so one must simply be careful or those things will no doubt break off. A few other notes: 1. If you are not the type to read manuals, do read this one. Assembly and operation are easy if you sit down and read the manual through before starting. It's not like a vacuum cleaner where you just plug it in and go. 2. My machine leaked badly BUT it was my own fault. There is a one-time only setup procedure where you squeeze the trigger and push the Clean-Surge button to lock a rod into place. Push the Clean-Surge button firmly. There may be a loud SNAP which sounds like you broke something, but you didn't. Until you get that snap, the Clean-Surge (which releases extra water-cleaner solution) is on all the time, hence the leaking. I didn't push the button hard enough initially, so I had the leak problem. EDIT December 2007 Apparently many people are assuming that without a loud snap, the Clean Surge will not work. All that matters is that your machine doesn't leak. If your SteamVac doesn't leak, it is assembled properly and the Clean Surge will work!!! The only reason I emphasized the \"snap\" was because so many people were having leak problems, which are easily solved. And it's possible that Hoover has changed the design after getting so many returns from people who didn't read the instructions in the manual. So don't get hung up on the snap. If your machine does leak after assembly, you know what to do. 3. ANY time it seems like there is no suction, the problem is that something is not seated properly. It is easy to snap the lid onto the dirty water container without lining it up properly, which causes a vacuum leak. If there is a vacuum leak, there is no suction at the bottom of the machine, where it is needed to suck up water from the carpet. Plus you'll see that the brushes aren't turning, as they're driven by vacuum. So recheck the dirty water lid. Carefully line up the hinges at the back. The front should snap closed very easily. If you have to force it a little to snap it closed, it means the back is not aligned properly and you'll get no suction. 4. If you have velvet or velvetine furniture, do NOT use the powered tool, use the utility tool. The powered tool is too strong for delicate fabric. 5. Like others have suggested, find a cheap alternative to the Hoover brand carpet detergent. One gallon of water doesn't clean a lot of carpet, and at 5 oz of soap per gallon, you go thru it fast. 6. Always be sure to dry vacuum your carpet with a regular vacuum cleaner first before using this machine to wash it. Be sure to remove and clean the brushes when you're done using this machine. Otherwise hair, thread, and balled up carpet fibers will dry on them and between them. Then the brushes won't turn. These are not \"use and put away\" machines like vacuum cleaners, they're \"use, clean, and put away\". 7. Here's something I do which you *might* want to try. For a very dirty carpet, I fill a cheap plastic 2 gallon watering can (or smaller for a smaller carpet) with hot water and a tablespoon or 2 of Oxy Clean. I then sprinkle the carpet heavily, being careful not to soak it. Then use the Hoover normally. Of course, this fills up the waste water receptacle long before the soapy water container is empty, but it still saves trips to the sink to load up on clean, soapy water. 8. Others have suggested using boiling water. Not for me, thanks. Too dangerous to handle and unnecessary, unless you've spilled or tracked in grease. After reading countless reviews here, I have concluded that the problems people have encountered are from failing to properly set up the machine initially, failing to seat the dirty water lid properly, or failing to clean the machine after use. I recommend this Hoover. It won't perform miracles, but I think if it is not abused it will last a long time and do an excellent job of maintaining a carpet.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "The Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge works astonishingly well for a consumer carpet cleaner. There are some limitations and some gotchas; I'll tell you about both. There's a 2-page \"Quick Assembly Guide\" and a 40-page manual. If you want your assembly guide with pictures and few words you'll like the QAG. If you prefer verbal instructions, turn to pages 4-6 of the manual; I wish I'd started there first. (It takes me longer to figure out \"Store Hose\" with four illustrations showing a hand in various steps of the process than to understand the eight sentences that accomplish the same instruction.) There's no heater in the \"SteamVac\", so make your gallon of water VERY hot for best cleaning. And prepare your carpet for cleaning before filling the tank with these two steps: (1) vacuum thoroughly; and (2) pre-treat heavily soiled or grease-stained areas. The vacuum in the SteamVac is designed to suck up water (which it does very well), but will only pick up the tiniest bits of solid crud. Hoover recommends buying their PreCleaner, but you can make your own for a lot less money. Just mix 10 parts sudsy ammonia to 1 part Simple Green in a spray bottle. Hit the stains with your spray, and work in with your fingers or a clean cloth. When cleaning you'll need to go over the carpet quite slowly to clean it well. This is the one area where the Hoover SteamVac is down a peg compared to the pro cleaners. Make two passes (one forward, one back) holding the trigger down; this is what squirts your hot detergent mix into the carpet. Then make two passes without using the trigger to suck up the bulk of the water. I found it really helps to clean your carpets barefoot. Because the \"dry\" pass greatly cools the carpet while it sucks up the water, it'll be easy to tell with your bare feet if you step on a warm, wet patch that you didn't dry yet. There's also a thumb button -- the \"Clean Surge\" -- which squirts the hot detergent mix more vigorously than the trigger does. Hold this down while making repeated passes over the really dirty parts of your carpet, then do your dry passes. The machine changes its pitch quite noticeably when the dirty water reservoir fills up, so you don't have to wonder about that; just pop it out, dump the yucky water in the sink, and make sure to clean the carpet fuzz off the fibrous filter. You use 5 ounces of Hoover's detergent to 1 gallon of water, and I found this was barely adequate for a medium-sized room. You get a 16 ounce bottle with the SteamVac. The manual says not to use other carpet detergents, as they sudse up too much. Amazon sells Hoover's gallon size, which is handy if you want to clean your carpets regularly -- it IS the best way to maintain them. There are other carpet cleaners, both from Hoover and its competitors. But THIS is the one you want.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "The F5914 really cleans carpets well. On my worst carpet area, the cleaner did as well as a commercial carpet cleaner. I recommend the following to make it a successful cleaning: 1) I supplement the hot water with some boiling water to really get the temperature up. By the time the water hits the spray nozzle, it has really cooled off so make it hotter. Bissell uses a heater, but it can't be that powerful without reducing motor power. Best to supplement. 2) Patience. Go slow and go over really bad areas. You will HAVE to pretreat and hand wash heavy stains, but so do the pros. Don't expect a diamond out of coal. You still have to do the work. 3) Clean often. I have one carpet that I waited way too long and it just won't come clean. The pros can't and I can't. BIG lesson learned there. Have fun with this. I can't believe how much dirt there was in my \"clean\" areas, so it will be great to have this around to clean when I desire to.

{"review": "I have been generally happy with my last two Hoover carpet cleaners and they have been durable for me. I used both TONS -- the 1st one was a very early model that was still going strong after 5 or 6 years of hard use, and I replaced it with one that had rotating brushes. It also got years of use but I accidentally damaged it thru my negligence. (Used it in an unheated cabin, left it overnight, and it got well below freezing - I broke the spray trigger when I impatiently tried to use it.) My last one still worked if you pushed the surge button and then pried it up again, but I decided to get a new one. I purchased this model, but it leaked before even starting to use it, so I returned it and bought a Bissell Proheat 2x. I liked that it seemed easier to clean the machine than the Hoovers, and that it had a rinse option, although not conveniently located. I noticed immediately with first use that it wasn't as good as even my old (trigger broken) Hoover. The Bissell didn't extract water well at all, even though I went over and over an area trying to get the water up. It was obvious by looking that it also didn't clean as well (probably as a result of leaving dirty water still in the carpets.) If it'd been my first carpet cleaner I might have thought it great since it did get dirt out, but I knew they didn't look as clean as in the past and mostly they were WET. The next day, before returning it I bought ANOTHER Hoover 914-900 thinking the first leaky one was an anomaly. The 2nd one leaked initially also, but once I used it for a minute, pressed and released the trigger a few times and the seals got wet, it stopped leaking. Thus I had two new cleaners to try side-by-side. Where I used the Bissell after the Hoover, there was no difference, the Bissell didn't get the carpet any cleaner. Where I used the Hoover on where I'd cleaned with the Bissell the night before -- a BIG difference. The carpet was visibly cleaner; (it's a very light carpet so it's easy to see that) the dirty water collected confirms that it picked up dirt the Bissell left behind; and the carpet was drier. This was a return to what I expected based on my last 2 Hoovers -- damp carpet, not WET carpet, and I think it's why the Hoover cleaned better. The Hoover isn't perfect -- the tanks need to be bigger for fewer trips to the sink (if too heavy for some people, they wouldn't have to fill as full), and there is no good way to clean it! I did like the idea behind the Bissell of having clean water with which to either mix with the detergent and spray, or to rinse with, and it would be a plus if Hoover would find a way to do that. (Especially if the \"rinse\" button was on the handle and easily accessible.) But Bissell's technique of inserting a plastic bladder for clean water inside the dirty water tank means neither holds much water which makes for extremely frequent trips to the sink. Also, having to stop, bend over, and switch a dial on the base to \"rinse\" and the same to switch back to cleaning mode was highly inconvenient. Last, Bissell's on-board water heater didn't seem to make a difference. Leaving behind too much dirty water was its downfall, it didn't matter that the water went in \"heated.\" I used the hottest tap water I could in the Hoover and it worked just fine. The \"proheat\" seems to me to be just another unneeded gizmo that can break. Overall, I guess it depends on what's most important to you. For me, clean carpets that dry in a couple of hours trumped ease of cleaning the machine.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I got this machine after the very basic $90ish Bissell I had for 4 or 5 years starting stinking (Similar to this but older: Bissell PowerLifter PowerBrush Upright Steam Carpet Cleaner). It still worked, but it must have cleaned up one too many chocolate milk spills. We took it apart and cleaned as much as we could, but to no avail - those things are not designed to be cleaned, and we could not get the stink out. I chose this Hoover model because it was so well reviewed and relatively inexpensive. I used my bissell probably every 2-4 weeks on my 14 year old offwhite carpet that we (husband, me, 4 year old twin boys and 2 cats ) eat and play on daily. To compare the two just on the actual cleaning, to my eyes, they are equivocal. The Hoover was able to get the stuff out that the Bissell had been able to get out. The water from the Hoover was no dirtier than it had been in the Bissell. I will say that the cleaning solution they send with the Hovoer is not as good as the Woolite OxyDeep steam cleaning solution you can buy at Walmart. I used the Hoover stuff initially and was very disappointed, but the second time switched back to the Woolite cleaner with much better results. The Hoover is, however, significantly better at extracting the cleaning solution. The waste water container filled up everytime before the solution tank was empty. With the Bissell, I would fill the tank with solution and only get about half of what I put on the carpet back up. This left the carpet very wet; I'd turn on the ceiling fan and place 3 box fans in our great room and 6 hours later the floor would be dry. With the Hoover, the carpets were slightly damp after cleaning, and were dry within an hour with celing fan and 1 box fan. In the end, this probably translates to cleaner carpets since more cleaning solution is being extracted. The only major complaint I have with this machine is the noise it generates. It is ridiculously loud! I have used it twice and my ears rang and ached afterwards. I will actually need to buy some hearing protection for when I use this machine. I have worked on flight lines around multiengine jet airplanes and was less concerned about by hearing then than I am with this carpet cleaner. It is really, really bad. Other small things that I've noticed: 1. The Hoover steamvac is MUCH easier to clean. The waste water container completely opens and you can thoroughly clean it before putting it away. The front can be unscrewed and the brushes can be removed to be cleaned. The Bissell's all-in-one tank was not designed to be cleaned, and that is ultimately why I had to replace mine. 2. Hoover's cleaning solution tank is oddly shaped, so if you have a standard kitchen sink and faucet, it is impossible to easily fill it up there. I had to start filling in the bathtub, which is not a huge deal, but not as comfortable to have to hunch over on my knees and try to get the water hot enough without making a huge mess in the tub. So, I'm not planning on sending it back (although I was actually comtemplating it for a bit). It does what it needs to do and is a better cleaning machine than the Bissell, although it is certainly not a perfect steam cleaner. I won't be terribly sad when it's time to buy another steam cleaner.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Living in a one-bedroom apartment, I had real qualms about having purchased this. However, after several cleanings, I can say it's absolutely been worth it. I have a short-haired cat who was home one time during a professional cleaning. The cleaner had let himself in when I wasn't home. I came home later to beautiful carpet, but I couldn't find the cat. No, he hadn't been sucked up by the steamer, but he was a terrified lump under the covers of the bed. He stayed there for a long time, huddled and shivering as I petted him through the covers. With time, my carpets started getting grungy again. Like most felines, mine goes through his shed-and-barf episodes a few times a year. I used to spot clean, but it always grossed me out, and I was never convinced I was getting deep enough. Considering I now had several spots and didn't want to put the beast through another traumatic professional cleaning, I sprung for the Hoover SteamVac. It's a hefty, heavy thing with minimal prep required to set it up for the first time. After shutting the cat in the bedroom, I was ready to go. I steamed the living room using the recommended amount of Hoover cleaner, adding my own boiling water from an electric kettle (the directions just say hot, but I had read other reviews here!). The stuff that came out of the carpet was amazing and disgusting. I had swept already, and still the water turned a filthy brown. It lifted the spots from the carpet like a pro. The Clean Surge feature is great for particularly difficult, set-in stains. One stain that had been there for a long time lightened, but could not be completely removed. Still, I was satisfied. The vacuum of the water worked great and left the carpet just slightly damp. It dried quite fast. After this, I was bitten by the cleaning bug and wanted to steam EVERYTHING. My car was several years old, having been purchased as a used vehicle. The seats had always bothered me because the driver's looked dingy and darker than the passenger side, and the passenger side was darker than the back seats. Even though the Hoover cord is quite long, I attached a couple extension cords together in order to reach from my apartment to the car outside. Setting the steamer up for cleaning upholstery is a more complicated process than steaming your carpets. I read the directions and remembered thinking I'd better not lose them because there's no way I'd remember what went where later. I went to work and steamed those seats. The results were nothing short of amazing. I could see muddy-colored water being sucked back into the Hoover. The cleaning using the upholstery attachments, including rotating, scrubbing brushes, worked wonders in cleaning out years of dirt and turning the seats much lighter. Months later, I've cleaned my carpets repeatedly. Each time I'm thrilled with the results. I don't always use as much cleaner as Hoover recommends because I've read the other reviews about cleaner possibly attracting dirt. I haven't noticed any difference in using half the amount of cleaner after the initial cleaning with full strength. After a cleaning, the cat barf spots are gone. Despite having vacuumed before cleaning, the cleaner still picks up cat hair and spits it out as wet little clumps that need to be picked up later when the floor has dried. It's just confirmation to me that the steamer is really getting in deep and pulling up ground-in dirt and hair. And you know what? This even works on linoleum! Granted, you may not want to pull it out as your primary method for washing floors, but it's great for a periodic steam cleaning. You have the option to turn the rotation of the brushes off if you're concerned about them on your floors. The cleaning solution also does a fantastic job and leaves the linoleum gleaming and shiny. My carpets always look great. They always have that \"just cleaned\" look about them. I've had people comment on them as they enter my home and insist on removing their shoes. I'm very satisfied with the performance of the Hoover. If you have carpet, and especially if you have an indoor pet, you'll get lots of use out of the SteamVac.", "id": "510106"}

The colors popped as if new again. I did every rug in the house. I too boiled some the water I added to the machine so it would stay hot while I worked. It is pretty easy to set up and use as well.

{"review": "Love it! I was reluctant to purchase any carpet cleaner, because of all the complaints I've heard about: hard to assemble, heavy, no suction, breaking, or difficult to change dirty and clean water. First when my Hoover arrived I decided to time how long it took me to assemble. In 30 minutes I dragged the box from the porch to the kitchen, took everything out of the box, assembled it according to clear instructions, and read about how to use it. The dirty and clean water compartments are a snap to remove and replace. IT IS NOT HEAVY. I'm a 5'5\" female and I push it around with no problem. Geez people, get off the couch? I have used the cleaner on both thick wool pile and on berber carpeting in my home. It worked equally well on both. I've also dragged it to work and cleaned my downright gross office carpet. I have one cat that throws up hairballs and just last week an antibiotic didn't agree with my other cat and she vomited everywhere. I cleaned up the surface stuff and the cleaner zipped it all right up. Anyone who has cleaned up vomit can appreciate how much time this save me, and the cleaner did a much better job than manual cleaning could hope to. I have a few practical suggestions. Do follow instructions and vacumm first. Do a couple extra drying steps, and turn on ceiling fans if you have them. You will be rewarded with dry carpets by the end of the day. Also, try spraying bad spots with some water before cleaning (water is cheap). I have also used a precleaner for particularly stubborn stains. So far no stains have defeated me. Another product I have had for a couple years and recommend is the Bissell Little Green Proheat with turbobrush. Great for little cleanups and the car. One last comment I can't resist. One review mentions excess water ruining wood floors. The instruction manual and the advertisement information clearly says it is NOT to be used on wood floors. I would expect someone with a PhD to have better reading comprehension. Sorry if I sound irritated, but, now that I have my cleaner, I am annoyed that negative reviews kept me from buying it sooner.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "This steam vac had the best overall reviews I saw, with no discernable trends on the negative reviews. I had no problem putting it together, although you do need to look in the screw holes and pull up on the lower plastic part before you can put in the 2 long screws that hold it together. It initially appears to be of questionable build quality, but it has worked great. I have cleaned every carpet in my house once, and the stairs and landings twice. The result was as good as the professionals I had come out, and the cost of the machine was less than it would have cost to get the cleaners to come once! In other words, if you get one good cleaning out of this machine, you're already ahead money-wise. Fortunately, it seems like it will hold up for a while, but again, I'm money ahead after only one cleaning. I did have an issue the second time I went to use it, in that when I set the cleaning solution/water tank into the machine, the water/solution mix started pouring out through the bottom. The fix was to plug the machine in and start it. The seals reseated themselves, and it didn't leak again. My advise would be to have it plugged in and on the surface you're going to clean before you set the tank into it, just in case you get a bad seal like I did that one time. If you do, just start it up and it will work fine again. Also, if your'e working on stairs, the handheld scrubber works very well. However, if working on the landings, and you're having to manhandle the vac around, the dirty water tank is sitting on the front, and if you lift the vac too high to reset it on the little landing, the bottom part of it could drop vertically, causing a spillout of the dirty water. Not a problem, just something to be careful of. The water that the machine sucked up was absolutely filthy, even on parts of the carpet that appeared reasonably clean, and that I had vacuumed dilligently before using the steam vac. This tells me the machine is getting out a lot of filth I'm not even aware of. With two dogs and a yard that had some bare spots when we moved in, the carpet had some muddy brown places where the dogs would settle down to lick off the dirt from their paws that I didn't see. The vacuum cleaned those places out completely without breaking a sweat. Sorry for the ramble, but reader's digest version: Steam Vac costs less than one professional carpet cleaning, but holds up well for the long run, so if you're thinking about getting your carpets cleaned, why not just get this machine and do it yourself for less money? Then every time it cleans your carpets again you can split the cost down until you're paying less than $10 for a whole house cleaning!", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "When trying to decide if this model (3670G) was the right vacuum for me, I found a considerable amount of confusing information regarding it's features on the internet..and from the manufacturer itself. First of all, many online retailers flat out state (inaccurately) that this model has a \"HEPA\" (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter and at least one of the reviews for it here on Amazon (at least as of this writing) seems to indicate that it has one as well. I can tell you outright that having checked with the manufacturer directly and now owning one myself that it does *NOT* have a \"HEPA\" filter. More on that a little later in this review however. I found another confusing aspect of the description is in the model number (i.e. 3670G). Be careful to understand the difference between what Amazon calls the 3670 (also called the 3670A in some places) and the 3670*G* models. They look identical and appear to be identical (both are yellow and black) however the 3670 only has a 9 amp motor and the 3670G has the larger, 12 amp motor. Amazon carries both models and I almost ended up buying the smaller one thinking it was the same vacuum. For only about a $5-$10 difference in total price, I'm not sure why the smaller version is even offered. It only seems to confuse the matter. The 3670 also does *NOT* have the \"HEPA\" filter incidentally. I found the 3670G to be an excellent value however and am pleased with my purchase. It is compact, very powerful and great for my needs. The noise...while high...is quite tolerable and not at all excessive considering how well it cleans. The generously long cord wraps easily around the base for storage and while a retractable cord would have been extremely useful, not having one is a reasonable trade-off in keeping the price down. The blower port feature is very handy for cleaning my computer insides (by blowing away dust without contacting electrical components as vacuuming would risk doing). The 3670G *does* require bags. It is not a \"bagless\" model however and while some may prefer a bagless model, I preferred a model that used bags. The bags are very easy to change on this model and not that much of an additional expense for what I consider to be the additional convenience (of being able to easily remove and dispose of a bag). The only reason I gave this model 4 stars and not 5 was because I did not find the attachment brushes quite adequate. Three attachment tools are included, a crevice tool, a 10\" floor tool and a combination tool with a triangularly-shaped brush (about 2\" wide) on the end. The combination tool also flips over to double as brushless pick-up (3\" wide). In my opinion, this cleaner badly needs a mid-sized brush and/or pick up tool that is about 4-5\" wide. The 2\" wide combination tool brush does concentrate the suction into a small area for high power but being only 2\" wide, I found that I simply had to move it much too frequently on larger surfaces (such as a wall for example) in order to cover the area needed. I would have rated this vacuum 5 stars if a brush about 4-5\" wide had been included. As it is, I am searching for an optional brush that size to purchase extra. Finally, a comment about the \"HEPA\" filter. Some people (particularly those with allergies or who need extremely dust free air) may want cleaners that include this item. In my case, I did not want this since I don't need it and \"HEPA\" filters can be quite expensive to change and replace (unless you get a washable one...also expensive). Since many online descriptions I found were unclear whether the 3670G included this filter (some descriptions flatly stated that it does), I found myself calling the Eureka customer service number to find out for sure. It turned out that even Eureka's own customer service representative was unsure whether it contained the filter or not and had to take some considerable time to find out that it didn't have one. If you *do* want the \"HEPA\" filter, you would want the 3684D...which looks the same but is red in color, slightly more expensive, and has more and better quality attachments as well as the \"HEPA\" filter. By the time you add in the cost of an optional additional attachment (which I mentioned earlier that I think is needed on the 3670G), you are at the price of a 3684D. In that case, the 3684D may well be a better value for you, particularly if you like the \"HEPA\" filter. Overall, I think \"The Boss\" series of canister vacuums is a great product. Eureka (and Amazon as well) needs to do a much better job of clarifying the differences between the particular models in the series however.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up, we were looking for an appropriate replacement. Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors, there were a few critical criteria. It had to be strong, yet compact in size. It should not be too loud, and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items. Finally, we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers. The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts. It produces a powerful vacuum, easily maneuverable, convenient for storing, the noise is not too bad, and a good price. This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value, and, certainly, gets the job done that we bought it for.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "I've never written a review for a vaccuum cleaner, and couldn't have imagined ever even wanting to, but am happy to put my voice out there for this one. If you have hardwood floors and are, like I was, tired of chasing after dust/dirt particles that your upright BLOWS around instead of sucking up, try this vac. It's powerful and makes quick work of what was, before, a major chore. I have sisal and dhurie wool rugs which neither of the uprights I've had before would do anything on, and this vaccuum works beautifully on both of those surfaces, as well. This is a fabulous product at a really fair price.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "Both Eureka and Amazon need to do a much better job of describing and clarifying the differences in models in \"The Boss - Mighty Mite\" canister vacuum series. Don't make the mistake that I almost did of buying the wrong model of this vacuum. There is also a 3670G model on Amazon (as of this writing) which is identical to this one but contains a 12 amp motor (versus only 9 amps for this one). For only about $5-$10 more in price, you get a more powerful vacuum with the 3670G. I'm glad I discovered the difference in time to get that one (which is a great machine!) instead of this less powerful model (which apparently also goes by the name of 3670A). This one may be great for those who don't need the extra power however and prefer the less expensive price instead. The price difference between the two models is so small however that I'm not sure why this smaller one is even offered. All other features of the two are identical. My review of 4 stars applies to the 3670G instead of this model and the only reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel that the attachments should include a 4-5 \" wide accessory brush instead of just the 2-3\" combination tool, crevice tool and 10\" floor tool currently included. The vacuum is an outstanding value in all other regards.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "For the money, this is a great little vacumn. I use it more than my $350 upright, since it's light and versatile. But, you may want to order better dusting and floor tools than the ones that come with it.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "After reading many reviews myself, I opted for the EUREKA BOSS. I was not sure of the difference between this model and the EUREKA MIGHTY MITE...I figured the BOSS had 12amps and could potentially supply more suction power. I think the vacuum works well on bare floors, I cleaned my lovely hardwoods with no problems..and it did wonders on the bathroom and kitchen floors aswell. However, I find that this little vacuum really puts you to work when it comes to cleaning carpet. I must have vacuumed the same spot on my area rug 10 times before I was content with the results. The same thing went for my low pile carpeting in the basement, after multiple passes, it finally got the job done. It comes with one attachment for both hard floors and carpeting, a brush tool for upholstery and a crevace tool. It's compact enough for easy storage, however, it doesn't come with a retractable cord. I like the fact that it's equiped with a HEPA filter, and I don't mind bagged vacuums, you toss the bag right out and that's the end of that, no messy jobs. If you have mostly hardwood floors, then I would recommend this product, however, if you're looking for superior suction to thoroughly clean your rugs in just a few passes, then you will be dissapointed.", "id": "510106"}
{"review": "On a mission to find the perfect canister vacuum with above-floor dusting capabilities: I swore I'd never own a Eureka vacuum cleaner ever again! I've had 3 that were miserable pieces of junk. However, the local vacuum cleaner store insisted that I examine the features before storming out of the store, so reluctantly I did. Not only was I surprised, I bought the thing, and it has replaced my less-than-a-year old Bosch because it's so much better. I need a good canister vacuum for my hard floors AND I need it to do extensive \"above the floor\" vacuum dusting for table tops, lamps, blinds, upholstry etc. It needs to be strong enough to remove the fur of two German Shepherd Dogs as well as seeds & feathers from my African Gray Parrot. The attachments that come with it are user-friendly -a crevice tool & a two-in one dusting brush / upholstry brush combo. I did purchase the better quality dusting brush as an acccessory. And, my Dyson power-head for fur removal from upholstry fits the wands perfectly. (Not so lucky with the Bosch I just gave away) Suction is excellent. It's adjustable for vacuuming throw rugs. Wands simply pull apart -no tabs to lock together- which makes it faster when you want to add a brush. Wands are made of plastic rather than metal & I've found they attract dog fur through electrostatic energy. So, I gave them a spraying with \"Static Guard\" & voila - no more fur sticking to them! This little guy maneuvers easily & is lightweight. It stores easily as well because of it's small size. Bags are small, but they hold an entire houseful of fur so I only have to change them after one cleaning. Some of the \"bagless\" vacs I've used required frequent emptying for the duration of household cleaning. I didn't give this little guy 5 stars because it doesn't have an automatic cord rewind. I've been spoiled by my other vacs which had them. The cord is much longer than the one on the Bosch I just got rid of. It's long enough to enable me to do two rooms, however, it's cumbersome to wrap underneath the vacuum when done. That's the ONLY fault I have with this unit. If you need a suction-only vacuum for hard floors with the ability to vacuum dust above them, this is the vacuum for you. It's an amazing little vac without all the expensive frills of higher priced units and does an amazing job for a tiny price tag. I think I'm going to keep this one around for a LOOOOOONG time.", "id": "510106"}

{"review": "I just got this vacuum and I love it. I have three dogs in the house with hardwood floors. This is the first vacuum I've had that actually gets embedded dog hair out of the couch. It has great suction and the floor attachment moves in such a way that I can get completely under furniture with low clearance--it kind of flattens itself. I only had to unplug it once thanks to the long cord and long hose, which is also nice. I like the smaller bag (but not too small), 'cause old dog hair can stink, so I'd rather dispose of it more often. Great vacuum for the money! Downsides: I wish the cord came out from somewhere else but the bottom or had some kind of clip to hold it in place. Not really an issue, but more a design flaw. Also, the suction reducer thingy is in a bad spot. It's where you actually hold the vacuum, so you can inadvertently open it. I pinched the heck out of my hand while closing it once, but I am super-clumsy. Still the best vacuum I've had.", "id": "510106"}

To me, the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one.

If it dies before its time, we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one. Fair enough, I thought. There are not a lot of features here and it isn't super powerful. Certainly adequate but our LG 900 watt heats things up a bit faster and has more useful programs like casserole re-heat with 4 levels and programs for either fresh or frozen vegetables with different quantities. The Danby reheat button has only 3 minutes; no other options. For most cooking/reheating you have to punch in the time you guess is about right manually. Considering the price ($100 Canadian plus sales tax) and the two year replacement warranty ($10 from Wal Mart), we are pretty well pleased with this so far.

{"review": "While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.

{"review": "While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.

The size was good and I was able to install it in my outdoor kitchen without cutting any concrete blocks. I had to bang and bend it back into shape which sort of worked but still does not look quite right so I am very disappointed. What made things worse was that I almost ordered a cabinet combo that was damaged but functional at a discounted price but decided to spend a little extra to get a non damaged item. I would not recommend this item because the company does not stand behind their product and is lazy when it comes to packaging.

The only reason that I did not choose a one star rating for this item is because it was ultimately useable after a significant amount of tinkering. This entailed grinding two of the feet and adding spacers between the other two legs and the platform. Then, once this was accomplished, we determined that the top/platform itself was warped.

{"review": "I bought the Wonder Wash basically because I'm lazy when it comes to doing laundry, I hate going to the laundry mat and I like gadgets. I came across this item while searching for something else. I had no intention of buying anything like this nor knew it even existed until I discovered it. I read the reviews positive and negative. Most of the reviews I read on other sites complained more about the company's customer service rather than the product itself. But after doing my research, I bit the bullet and decided to give it a try. I live on the 4th floor of a 4 floor walk up in NYC. We have laundry facilities in the basement of the building and a few laundry mats near by, but like I said I'm lazy and hate doing laundry. I've had this unit for over a month and have done many loads. To make a long story short, this machine works for me. Here's my take: Pros: * Inexpensive: for what it does, its a fairly good buy at $40. As for detergents, bleach and fabric softener, I only have to use 1 - 2 tbsps. depending on the size of the load or less if the detergent is 2x concentrated. My building laundry costs about $3 a load, I average 3 loads a session, so I figure with the savings on quarters and detergent, this machine will pay for itself in no time. * Convenient: I can wash a load in my apartment anytime day or night during the weeknight or on the weekend. My clothes don't pile up as much anymore. I find that I wash my clothes more often because of the convenience. * Small: The unit only weights 6lbs when empty and is very portable. I live in a tiny one bedroom with little extra space. I can just put this away in my closet when not in use. * Sanitary: I can wash my clothes without worrying about whatever kind of nastiness has been washed previously in the community washer. My building's machines are always dirty and usually need to be wiped down. * Quick: Although you can technically \"wash\" a load in 2 minutes, you also need to factor in the draining and rinsing time. So I would say to wash a full load of laundry takes about 5 minutes. Which is still very quick compared to a conventional washer. * Effective: I don't expect miracles from this machine. I still pre-treat my clothes if necessary and I still use bleach in my wash loads when need. I have to say with some hot water and 2 - 5 minutes of labor, my clothes come out very clean. * Manually Powered: I'm a gadget person, so I love to push buttons and make cool things happen, however, a lot has to be said for going old school. I like the fact that I don't have to worry about where to plug the unit in or that a motor burning out. A little arm workout doesn't hurt either. Cons: * The machine is basically made of plastic. The manufacture says that it's made of the highest, most durable plastic, but at times the brackets do seem a bit wobbly. The washer itself seems sturdy. The base is questionable. Some of the small screw caps did not stay in place, but they are not essential to the unit staying together or washing properly. * Can be messy: Washing clothes in this unit is not the tidiest of processes. I initially tried it in my kitchen, but I spilled more water than I used, so I eventually move the unit to my bathtub and found that it fits perfectly and I don't have a problem with water being everywhere. * No assembly instructions: The unit does not come with a lot of instructions on how to put it together, but it's not that difficult to figure out. You are really only assembling the base not the tub. You really can look at the pieces laid out and see how it all fits together. It took me less than 10 minutes to unbox and assemble. * Where the suction?: The unit does have suction cups for stability, but I have to say they stick the best when you don't need them to. When the water splashes, the suction cups tend to not stay in place. However, I've found when using the unit in the bathtub, this wasn't an issue. The unit did still slide around a bit but not enough to disrupt the washing process. * Bait and Switch: When I received my Wonder Wash I was surprised to find they sent me a Sputnik 3 that looks exactly like a Wonder Wash, but was renamed. I hadn't seen anything on their site claiming they renamed the units, so I was a little suspicious. However, the unit seems to do what the Wonder Wash claims to do, so I kept the unit. I can, however, see how other reviewers see this as a bait and switch and question the quality of the Sputnik 3 compared to the Wonder Wash. I can only speak for my unit and say that so far I haven't had any problems. I do think the manufacturer should really clear this up or stop sending out the Sputnik 3s as Wonder Wash. * Hard to Crank: When I first started using the unit, it was at times hard to crank. But, through trial and error, I found that the amount of water you use for the size of the load is every important. The instructions say that the smaller the load less water is needed, but I didn't necessarily find that to be the case all the time. I eventually found that over time you will be able to determine what the right clothes to water ratio is to make it crank smoothly. The right amount of water in the unit can make the cranking action effortless. * The Tricky Lid: The lid for the machine can be a little tricky. It's almost like working with a child-proof cap to get the right fit. The trick is to unscrew the lid all the way until you almost take the screw out. Place the lid on the unit and lock the lid in the groves around the unit. Hold the lid in place around the groves and then tighten screw back all the way down. By doing this, you get the tightest fit and therefore the most pressure and fewer leaks. When you loosen the lid after a wash, you should hear a hissing sound of the air releasing, then you know you had a good tight fit. * No Spin Cycle: Since this is not your typical washing machine with a spin cycle you will need to either ring your clothes dry by hand or do like I did and buy an Spin Dryer Centrifugal Clothes Portable Spin Dryer. As stated before I'm lazy when it comes to laundry, so wring out the clothes after washing would have been deal breaker in buying a Wonder Wash. The Spin Dryer completes the Wonder Wash. Overall, I like the machine. Yes, I can see areas of improvement, but so far, so good. That's not to say that if given the choice I wouldn't buy a regular washer, but for my current situation it works. Especially now that the cold weather is on it's way, the thought of staying in my warm apartment and getting a couple of loads of laundry done in about 30 mins. makes the Wonder Wash a really good buy for me.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "The notion of washing my clothes with no electricity, and less soap and water seemed attractive. So i used the Wonderwash exclusively for the last six months to test it out. i am a single father who works in an office, but hobbies in the garden. My laundry battles are kid clothes (food, snot, paint, etc.), office clothes (sweat, ring around the collar) and outdoor clothes (mud, plant matter, etc.). The wonderwash is not an effective substitute for a mechanical washing machine. It fits neatly in a tub, seals effectively, cranks easily, and drains quite well. But it does not wash clothes as effectively as a mechanical machine. Here's why... A mechanical machine alternates between agitating your clothes for several minutes and soaking your clothes in the soap. It also rinses and agitates, and spins semi-dry in a centrifuge. The spin-dry is no big loss. You wring out your clothes gently, hang dry and their 90% dry by morning. The wash quality, however, is stickler. Unless you literally stand over your Wonderwash for 40 minutes, you cannot replicate the agitation and soak routines of a mechanical machine. Clothes are noticeably and dramatically less clean out of the Wonderwash. For clothes that didn't go in particularly unclean, that's not a problem. A casual evening shirt worn once, with no stains will come out looking, feeling and smelling refreshed. However an item with even the simplest of stains will come out with the simplest of stains. Your son's shirt that he dropped a few bits of dinner onto will look like you never washed it. Your work shirts will develop ring around the collar. Your garden clothes... forget about it. All stains must be hand-washed/hand-removed prior to going into the Wonderwash. i found a plastic bristled brush to be a necessary accessory to scrub out stains with the appropriate solvent/enzyme/soap/whatever prior to Wonderwashing. Aggressive brushing, however, can damage your clothes finish and/or color--be careful. After several months, i found my clothes to start have a noticeable smell and somewhat unpleasant smell when wringing them out before hang drying. I countered this last night at the six month mark by taking several loads to a mechanized washer. One round on \"normal\" cycle and they came out smelling great. For experiment's sake, i washed a load on the machine's \"hand wash\" cycle... same smell problem... the agitation is everything. The machine is most effective for barely-worn clothes such as adult knits and delicates. Although Wonderwash hasn't done me wrong--it's saved me much on the electric bill, and/or trips to the laundromat, it is as yet an imperfect innovation. i have taken great pains to experiment with different crank-agitation and duration methods. The best i've found is a series of slow cranks (so no inertia permits clothes to ride over the top) followed by a series of back and forth rocks (a la a washing machine). Doing this for several minutes and then resting for several minutes and repeating earned me the best results. i have observed no effect of the pressurization of this laundry method. i have observed no decrease in water use (multiply out the size of the load and the corresponding rinse). i have observe no decrease in soap use (a conventional washer likewise requires no more than a few tablespoons of soap--most folks over-soap to the extreme. If agitation could be improved (either through gearing or adding some sort of fins or something inside... If a pseudo centrifuge could be added (not difficult engineering... This could have revolutionary potential. But as is, it will not change the world.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I decided to buy this product because I needed a way to wash clothes at a vacation camp that was a step up from using the sink and a washboard. This fills the bill. I went to YOUTUBE, and found a video of a fellow demonstrating the item, [...] and that was enough for me--I ordered the thing. It's Idiot-Easy to use. Throw in a few litres of warm to hot water (the warm water helps create the vacuum, and pulls the water through the clothes) with a teaspoon of detergent (you don't need much at all), give it a quick swish, then toss in the clothes--a few pounds worth. I was able to do a few tee shirts and not-terribly-heavy trousers in one go with no sweat. Then you screw on the top, making sure you have a tight seal, and start turning the handle-thing. You can either use the little handle and get it going at a fast clip, or simply bat the thing round and round using the screw-down flidget at the top and the little connector to the 'bayonet drain' at the bottom. You do this for two minutes or so. Then, making sure you've got the thing near a sink, you attach the jazzy bayonet device to the bottom and the soapy water drains out. Throw in another few litres of water, screw the top on, repeat the process, and your clothes are nicely rinsed. And they look and smell CLEAN. For the terminally lazy, yep, you have to either SQUEEZE those clothes or let them drip dry. I recommend squeezing, otherwise you'll be waiting forever for them to dry, if you don't live in the desert. I'd also advise you to do a little pretreating if you've got some profoundly nasty dirt on your clothes--it's not a miracle worker! For a situation where you're on holiday and need to wash clothing infrequently, but you don't want to run around in stinky clothes or spend a precious hour or two of vacation time at the laundromat, this is just the thing. The clothes come out CLEAN--not like you've moved them around in funky water and hung them out. It's not real big, you can stash it in a closet when you aren't using it, and you can set it up by the kitchen sink and get two loads of laundry done inside of ten minutes once you get a rhythm going. Then all you need to do is peg it out on the line outdoors, or hang it over the bathtub to dry. Watch a news program review the thing, here: [...](In my opinion, the reporter uses too much detergent in her demo--less is more!)", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I bought a Wonder Washer from Laundry Alternatives, actually I have purchased two. One for a friend who also loves hers. Regarding the SPUTNIK 3 label - there may be some grounds for confusion over the labeling, but the machine is the exact same, I had them side by side and there is no difference. When the manufacturer changes labels it does cause some confusion. Now: You put this little machine together, and the idea is for it to spin with the crank handle using warm to hot water and a pressure-sealed top that creates pressure inside, forcing the small about of detergent into the fabric of the clothing. To me, the handle was a bit \"iffy,\" mine came with a screw to be driven into a plastic plug instead of a metal cotter pin. Judging the weight of water plus clothing and the flexibility of the stand, I just took it right back off. If you wash very small loads with no more than one-and-a-half quarts of water, you'll be just fine with the handle. But, I still didn't mark it down for that. I fill the machine about half-full of water, temperature depending on the clothing items, state of soil, etcetera. Then, I have my uppare workout. After the machine is properly loaded and sealed, I put on my 1-pound wrist weights and turn the machine by hand for a count of about 120 - 150 complete rotations, take off the weights, insert the drain and let it drain. Once the water has mainly run out, I remove the top and turn the tub to empty the contents. Quick double rinse in cold water and the wash part it done. **Here's where the difference comes in. This machine does EXACTLY what it says it will do, clean your clothing and fabric items quickly and simply. They never said it would wring (please - get the spelling right, we don't \"ring\" clothes) the items for you. I use a SPIN DRYER - makes all the difference! The soaking, dripping items are plopped right into my \"Charming Spinner,\" spun for a couple of minutes until the water has stopped coming from the spout and then they are ready to be hung up to dry. That's it. CAPACITY: In my Wonder Washer, I can get one flannel queen-sized bed sheet and one pillow case at a time, meaning my bed clothing takes two cycles to get done. OR - I can get one pair of flannel lined jeans, two underwear, and a pair of socks. OR - Regular jeans, one pair plus 3 or 4 men shirts. OR - One large bath towel plus two T-shirts Any way, all this to say, I have used the Wonder Washer SOLELY for the last five months to process laundry for two people, only once using the pay washer-dryer for a comforter which is too large to wash by hand and also to large to go into the spin dryer. It has worked for me, and by my nearest calculations my initial out for the Wonder Washer washer and the spin dryer were recouped in 10 weeks. Now I am shopping for a portable washing machine, electric-style since my new job requires me to commute and I won't have the time to do laundry by hand. Bottom Line: To me, clothing is personal and processing laundry by hand is very satisfying. The Wonder Washer will be put away for use on weekends when I don't have a daily commute that takes time away from home where I do enjoy housework style working at home. I highly recommend it, treat it gingerly as it is a small hand powered laundry machine, and you'll get good use of it.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Wonderwash is perfect for small places and for doing small laundry loads between laundromat visits. Can do almost all your laundry if single and just don't want to use community washers. See You Tube Video. Cost is reasonable at $50 including shipping. Bought Wonderwash a while ago and this plastic barrel machine works well. It holds up to 2-3 outfits depending on garment materials & size. Ex: 1 dress, 2 pants, 2 shirts + a few undergarments all at once. Or 1 winter heavy knit sweater + 2 jeans or so. Maybe 1 full/Qn bed linen piece + 1 towel at a time, etc --while mindful not to mix whites with colors & to pre-treat heavily soiled pieces. I recommend filling up machine with laundry below 1/2 it's mark to then add enough hot (or warm water) + a couple spoons of detergent to the allow all to swoosh around. Gently spin handle for 4 mins, drain dirty water with tube attachment according to instructions. Pour clean hot or warm water to rinse. Close pressure lid. Spin handle. Repeat drainage + water pouring with softener, etc as desired. Voila. Pretty clean clothes & a workout to shape & tone arm muscles too. Use wrist weights for greater arm workout results! I bought Ecover brand scented detergent & softener plus Maggie's Soap Nuts (to make a water softening rinse) prior to getting the Wonderwash. These are safer & gentler on sensitive hands & skin as I was doing simple small laundry loads by hand. But as soon as that Ecover set is done and if I get the Laundry Alternative's Spin Dryer, I'll be wonderwashing with a spoonful of Tide or Cheers & rinsing off with another spoonful of good ol' Downy or Snuggle! Surely these laundry products work better in getting clothes clean-er with lasting scent in less Wonderwashing spin sessions!", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "This washer is ingenious and simple, and by itself, manages to wash ALL of my, and my husband's clothes, every single week. Our clothes have NEVER been so clean. I attribute that to it's simple, yet highly effective pressure system. I know it takes a bit of fumbling around at first to get this thing to working as ideally as it is intended, and I've read where other reviewers have maybe gotten fed up or didn't have the patience. I wasn't perfect at it at first. But I've perfected my method, and I now can wash five to seven loads of our clothes in under two hours (including pauses for rinsing, spin drying in our centrifugal spin dryer, and hanging). It's astounding (to my husband - I had a hunch all along, haha) just how many clothes you can wash in the thing! I don't recommend overfilling, but you truly can get away with several shirts (I'd say 3-4), a pair of jeans (my husband's over 6 foot, and wears some pretty substantial jeans), and a week's worth of boxer shorts and underthings, in ONE load. Nowdays, I've got my method so fine-tuned that I just pile all our clothes beside our (clean) bathtub, the Sputnik 3/Wonderwash in the center, my buckets (I use two standard size buckets to alternately fill with water) on the side with the water faucet. I fill S3 with water and the little soap it requires to do its job, agitate the water briefly with my hand, toss in one load, watch the clock for a couple (and I really mean TWO here) minutes while I get a nice little arm workout cranking (if you fill the load right, it's actually not that good of an arm workout - you'll learn the right balance of clothes/water after a few trials). Release the pressure lid, being sure to unscrew almost completely, so that the next time you put it on, you'll get a nice snug fit. I remove the clothes and place them in my prepared buckets with clean water and give them a good squeezing out. I've gotten to where I really don't use the draining spout. I find it's quicker just to turn S3 over and empty the water that way, into the bathtub. But if you're not in the bathtub, obviously, you'll want to drain more neatly. Usually I replace my clean load into the S3 for a rinsing round, filling up another bucket with water as I go. I flop the wet clothes to the other side of the bathtub, and move to the next load. I continue til I'm done. It truly takes fractions of the time standard washer units take to wash clothes. Our clothes are ten times cleaner I feel, and not nearly as distressed at the end of washing. Our delicates are in heaven, and the rest of our clothes are lasting way longer, looking far newer, than they would otherwise. I've been amazed at how clean our sheets are - and how easy it is to clean sheets with S3. We've got high threadcount sheets, and they apparently LOVE being treated with such care. They are literally shiney when they've finished drying. [...] has the corner on this alternative to standard clothes washing and drying and bravo for them! Their customer service has treated me with impressive speed and have been very personable and professional. My only critique of the Wonderwash is that the base is not as finely crafted as the unit itself. Mine is working fine, and it's imperative that you install all its parts correctly. However, I feel that it could be sturdier. It's not losing a single star over that though. It's an ingenious piece of equipment. I THOROUGHLY recommend it.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Is it hard to turn? I am 83 with breathing problems and the answer is no. The key is smaller load and plenty of water. I have a newish fancy schmancy front loader which I hate. Energy saver my foot. It is easy on water, but drinks electricity. Now I only have to use it twice a month for sheets and heavy stuff. The Wonderwasher is perfect for delicate wool sweaters too.

{"review": "I use my wonderwash about four times a week, mostly for small items like cloth diapers (pre-rinsed by hand first), baby clothes, socks and underwear. For me, it does what I wanted it to do, which is save the vast amounts of money we were previously spending using the $4 washers and dryers in our apartment building. I'm glad I got it and would buy it again. The pros: * Clothes really do come out clean. Even diapers. No problems. * It doesn't take too long. Not as super-speedy as you might expect given that washing takes only two minutes of handle-turning and rinsing takes one minute, but still, it's about 10 minutes a load even with the poor water pressure in our taps. (The time-consuming part, for me, is filling up the washer with 6 quarts of water, once for washing and once for drying, and also waiting for the water to drain out again after each part of the cycle.) I used it in the bathtub once, where we have much better water pressure. The filling took only a few seconds, but the turning was much more awkward. So now I do it on the kitchen countertop and drain into the kitchen sink.) The cons: * It's not horrible to turn, but it's not just a quick twiddling of your fingers either. There is a moderate amount of actual effort involved. * DON'T FORGET THAT THINGS WILL COME OUT SOPPING WET. The machine doesn't spin at all, so you have to get the water out yourself by wringing things manually. This takes a while, especially if your load consists of a billion small items, and all the wringing is more effort than turning the machine. If you did this to a no-iron shirt, you'd get horrible wrinkles that would be tough to get out even with an iron. And also, no matter how well I wring the clothes, they still end up considerably wetter than they would be if they'd been through a regular washing machine with a spin cycle. Since I hang clothes to dry in our apartment, that means I wait about 12 hours for them to be completely dry, rather than about four. This means that our apartment is almost never free from \"decorations\" of socks draped over the chairs. I think it is probably worth getting one of those mini-spinners too, to take care of this problem. Tips: * As I saw in someone else's review before I bought it, it really is easier to turn the handle if you have the full six quarts of water in it, even if you're not washing a \"full\" load of clothes. * Don't use much detergent, or you'll have to do more than one rinse to get rid of it all. The clothes really do come out clean even with only a teaspoon or so. Less if it's the HE stuff.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Living in New York, I saw the Wonderwash as an amazing chance to opt out of the laundromat. I bought the Wonderwash after seeing several similar products online. I was pleased by the results I was getting in terms of cleanliness and ease of use... but two weeks in the handle snapped off. For some reason while the rest of the plastic was relatively heavy duty, the part which would be getting the brunt of the torque from spinning was made of soft, malleable plastic. It squeaked for a bit, then just ripped off. On the plus side, the vendor was great about returning my money!", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I purchased the Wonder Wash but was sent a different model altogether - the Sputnik 3. It broke within a week of use - one of the pivots simply cracked. The lid never closed tightly, and to secure the handle you have to use a metal screw directly into the plastic - so the handle is never properly in place. I've been in touch with the company about these issues, but they stuck to their line that it's a strongly built product. They offered to replace it with the same, fragile model. I decided to return it instead and get a refund. The biggest problem is that the picture you see on amazon - or the laundry alternative website - or for that matter, the machine they use in demonstration videos etc. -- looks very different than what the company sends you. That is misleading advertising - a reason to stay away from this product in and of itself.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Length:: 6:48 Mins Although my old mini Panda (blue machine) is still going strong, my niece just had a baby this past year and I am sending the Panda mini off to her to help make surviving toddlerhood a little easier for her and her little man. I have upgraded to this new Panda small compact portable washing machine that includes the spin dryer too - all in one small unit! Since I am still living in an apartment with no washer and dryer or hook ups, this machine is even easier and better than the Panda mini/blue washer in every way for my laundry needs. With a stated 6-7 pound capacity, it has the ability to do larger loads, and with the electrically assisted pump I find that rinsing and draining are much easier! What more could I have wanted but an attached spin dryer which is now on board too; it does a fantastic job of wringing the clothes almost bone dry. Having loved the Panda mini washer for nearly two years, I am even more impressed and happy with my new Panda Small Compact Portable washing machine! Here are a few more notes and hints I have come up with for getting the best results with the Panda small compact washer: Use a mesh bag with any articles of clothing that have long sleeves, or long legs, especially items that get very heavy when wet like jeans or sweaters. The agitator in the washer side is very powerful and therefore free floating long articles of clothing can get tangled or twisted together during the wash cycle. I have found that the clothing still gets perfectly clean when mesh bags are used, but with no tangling or damage to the fabrics. When using the washer for the first time try adding the load of laundry with NO SOAP, just water and set the timer for 3-5 minutes. Frequently there is a great amount of soap residue and buildup trapped in the clothing fibers and you will see this as foam or even suds appearing when the clothing is just agitated with clean water. As you wash those same clothes in the Panda a second or third time you will need anywhere from teaspoon to about a tablespoon of high efficiency liquid soap per load depending on the type of fabric, type of detergent, size of load, and how soiled it is. When not in use, leave both doors to the washer and spin dryer open. This will help any water droplets left behind to evaporate, avoiding any issues with moisture, mold or mildew. I am attaching a detailed video comparing the two machines so if it has not appeared yet, please check back in a day or two. If you have a question that has not been covered here please use the comments section to ask; I will do my best to answer. 06/27/13 Edited to add: Regarding rinsing: The instructions do NOT state the following tip, but after using the machine for over two months I have tried this rinsing trick with great success. Because my method is NOT part of the original use instructions, I can only recommend you try this next tip \"at your own risk\". By following these steps, you can quickly and efficiently rinse the just cleaned load to be completely soap free AND you can save the soapy water for re-use with next load (assuming the water is not extremely dirty from the previous load). Step 1: do NOT drain soapy side. Just transfer the wet soapy clothes to the spinner basket. Step 2: with *both* spinner doors OPEN, add 5 minutes time on the spin timer. This will cause the spin side to continuously drain any water you will be adding while you rinse. For this step, to add water you can use a diverter/sprayer, the original hose, or small bucket with a pouring spout. Step 3: When feel you have finished adding enough water to rinse the clothes, use the plastic screen gadget that is included with the spinner to press the clothes down, compacting as them as firmly as possible. Step 4: Close the lid and allow the machine to spin the clothes as dry as possible. Compacting the clothes shortens the spin time by effectively wringing at least part of the excess water out and also prevents a waterlogged, unbalanced load from making the whole machine \"shimmy\". This is also why it is a GOOD thing that the spin side is SO small - for optimal performance in spinning the clothes. Step 5: If you still see any soap residue in the water being drained, re-set the timer for another 2-3 minutes and use either the hose provided or even a small measuring cup to slowly pour a small amount of additional water into the spin side inlet hole; the added water will be very rapidly dispersed into the garments and provide an even cleaner rinse. Repeat any of the steps as necessary but just make sure there is at least 1-2 full minutes of uninterrupted spin time left where no additional water is added in order to have the most water wrung from the clothes and have the shortest possible drying time. Good luck! - DG 08/18/13 Edited to add - Immediately after posting the original review I had submitted a revision with a disclaimer stating the source of the item(s) under review. I was not aware until today that the revision was not accepted or posted by Amazon, possibly due to the fact that the video portion of the review depicts TWO products with two different sources. To be 100% clear and transparent, I have created and posted over 800 reviews, and as of this edit, all except three items were purchased by me with my own funds; the reviews are either marked by Amazon as such, with a badge stating \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" or I often state where I purchased the item in the written review, ex. big box store, Walmart, etc. Since I am entirely new to having a product submitted to me for review, this video is unique as it features a product of both circumstances. The video demonstrates my experience two units; the one referred to as the \"blue machine\" I paid for with my own funds through Amazon.com in Nov. 2011. I received the \"white machine\" (the greater subject of this review) directly from Sepgo, Inc. at no cost to me for the purpose of testing and review in May 2013. Regardless of source , the opinions expressed are 100% my own with NO influence from any other person or company. Thank you to a youtube user whose question alerted me to the fact that my disclaimer stating such had not been added as requested; my integrity as a reviewer is very important to me and I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify the matter.

{"review": "I only give a 4 star rating because the spin dryer is incredibly small, but the washer appears larger than advertised. However this leads to spending quite a long time spin drying your wash-load piece by piece. Thus, I'm considering purchasing the Laundry Alternative spin-dryer which seems like it can hold a larger load to spin dry. I've only used both aspects of the unit once, but the washer seems incredibly powerful and washes clothing really well. I like that it lacks a center pin to tear your clothing or get trapped/ wrapped around. This unit seems much better than their previous model with clear, blue, plastic siding. The previous model looks incredibly flimsy, this newer unit looks and feels very sturdy. I worry about the hosing on the new model, which might need to eventually be replaced. The hosing seems so soft and flimsy. Warning: The unit gives off a powerful, acrid, plastic, chemical smell. It is incredibly pungent. Hopefully whatever it is will off-gas soon. My apartment smells pretty bad. UPDATED REVIEW: March 10, 2013 I have used the machine consistently for the past few months. No complaints, besides the speed of the spin dryer seems to have decreased. I'll probably have to purchase The Laundry Alternative spin dryer which is 2-3x as fast and will leave my clothes pretty dry. I don't use a tumble dryer, just a bamboo folding clothes rack. My clothes dry really well overnight. Things I have been able to wash: Separately: Mattress cover (Queen Sized Mattress), Fitted Sheet (Queen Sized Mattress), Non-fitted Sheet (Queen Sized Mattress). I have also washed 2-3 sweaters at a time (considered a full load). This depends on their thickness and how much water they absorb. As for jeans/ pants, I've been able to wash 2-3 in a load. It all depends on how thick the fabric is and how much water it'll absorb.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I was going to wait a couple of weeks to write this review... but I feel compelled. Let me start out with I'm just an average Joe, on my wife's amazon account that we bought the wash machine on. We've only had the Panda for 2 days, but we have used it about a month's worth thus far... so I feel I am experienced enough to write this. This machine is GREAT! If you're like me, you hop to the reviews and usually get the same responses reworded over and over again and you get a general feeling for the product. My reviews tend to be more or less rebuttals or further insight to what others have said. First off, let me start by saying this is my first time living in an apartment (3 years now) and ever having to deal with a laundromat... I HATE that. The Panda fixes it! I no longer have to time machines or strategically plan when I wash my clothes. The freedom of this alone is well worth the cost. As for performance... you can read other reviews to get the ins and outs... I'll just say it does what a reasonable person thinks it will do. It cleans clothes and relativity dries them. This is not a high end washer and drier combo. It won't remove that red wine you spilled on your lap while eating caviar... but it'll get your clothes clean. I'm not sure why so many people expected the dryer to get the clothes 100% dry all while not having a heating element... it's common sense people. It dries them to barely damp, and a quick hang dry does the rest. If you are looking for more than any of this I have a simple solution... get a better job, get paid more, buy a house and get a great washer and drier... but for us average Joe's... this thing works great. I've also read that the dang thing leaks. Yup... There was a little water on the ground after my numerous loads tonight. Not sure if it was user error or machine defect. I put the unit in the bathroom and wiped up the water with a towel after... it wasn't that much water. Now I know what you're thinking \"but I don't want water on my bathroom floor.\" Do me a favor and remember your last time in the laundromat... (still remembering?) yeah... that's what i thought... who gives a crap about a little water on the ground? At least I'm not at the laundromat. Overall... this thing works great for what it is. Do not expect a high end perfect washer and drier b/c honestly... if that's what you are expecting then maybe you need a dose of reality. But for us average Joe's just trying to get by in this world... this little machine makes life a whole hell of a lot easier.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "We received this item yesterday and washed a few loads of underwear and shirts. The tub is fairly small and the spinner is even smaller. It does a pretty good job on these items, but we did have to load the spin side several times to take care of what was in the washer. Going through this process over and over, then rinsing all of it was time consuming. Today I started washing my blue jeans. I wear 38x34 which aren't exactly the size of a two-person backpacking tent. The tub will hold two pair but the agitator didn't work, so I had to wash one pair at a time. Washing, rinsing, and rinsing again along with pumping water out and refilling between all the steps took nearly half an hour per pair. It works but is very time consuming when washing a heavy item. Now that we have all the laundry caught up it will be better if we wash a small load each day. If it piles up it will kill the better part of a day. It works, but don't expect a regular washing machine. This will keep you busy with a lot of small loads.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Ok. I'm one of those picky people, I want a lot and I want it cheap. I bought my machine through a place in Canada because I couldn't get it shipped from the US to where I live. I live in Kodiak ALaska. Anyway I read the reviews and someone recommended Canada, it worked for me. If you are in the Lower 48 States order it from Amazon. The machine is compact, it takes up about as much space as a clothes hamper. You have to wash smaller loads, but the run time ranges 3 to 15 minutes, Pretreating stains and soiled clothes with a spray is recommended. I can wash about three of my shirts at a time 2XL, for my wife and younger kids about 6 at a time, it takes 3-4 minutes a load, I usually add the fabric softener at the same time as the soap. You only need a bit over a table spoon of detergent, much more and you'll find yourself rinsing two to three times, but the extractor helps. My routine, add water, soap, and softner, wash 3-5 min, put in extractor, run and then run water into extractor pulling clothes out and puting them back in and run again. so twice through the extractor. If the kids clothes are dirty or mine, I run the wash longer, If I'm feeling energetic, I might do it twice. We hunt and fish and do outdoors stuff so we get dirty. Don't buy this machine expecting to throw the clothes in and just wash them because it requires more than that. A little bit of elbow grease is needed to do the laundry, it doesnt fill up automatically and it doesn't drain automatically. You have to control the faucet to fill it, it does have a drain pump but you have to turn the knob on and then off when it's done. It is a great machine and not to expensive it is fairly quite but it does make noise but it's not loud, my neighbors have yet to complain and sometimes I wash things in the middle of the night. I recommend this to anyone living in an apartment or looking to save money on laundrymats. I can easily wash a queen sheet in it but I don't recommend it, I recommend taking sheets, blankets and heavy items to the laundry ie; towels are heavy. If you wash a towel, do two at a time and extract them one at a time, save yourself a little headache. It works great for everything else, I were dicky Work pants they are heavy, I wash them a pair at a time, and extract them a pair at a time, time consuming, a little but worth it. Like I said don't expect to throw your clothes in and go play tennis. It is a good machine it works well and it will save you money. After using the (Extractor) dryer, We hang the clothes up and let them air dry, we hang them inside on a rack (we live in Alaska they freeze during the winter outside). Like I said, the machine works great I recommend it. Our family size is (6) 2 adults, 2 teens and 2 elementary age. So if it can wash all of our stuff, it can wash yours. We've had our machine for almost six months now and use it all the time. the younger kids even have fun doing laundry so teach them, you might even be able to get them to wash some of your stuff. It costs me a $1.50 to wash and a $1.50 to dry a load in the complex, the cheapest washer in town is $3.00 to wash. So the machine has paid for itself and saved $$ for us already. And as an added bonus the expression on your mailmans face will be priceless. Mine said it was the first time he ever delivered a washing machine, Tell me, you think he wasn't telling that story to his coworkers and anyone else who would listen. Oh yeah, the machine is light also, weighs about 15 pounds maybe. My six year old easily moves it around when he wants to wash stuff or just move it out of his way. Hope this helps in your decision. And yeah every now and then a flawed machine does get in the mix, but that happens with everything, I remember A Maytag that was a lemon.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Seriously this has been the best purchase for us!! There are two adults, one toddler, two cats, and one dog living in our three bedroom apartment sans washer/dryer or laundromat in the vicinity. We were looking around for a small washer and found this on amazon with rave reviews. So we ordered it 1/10 and arrived 1/15. It smelled a little plastic like so I spun it with fresh clean water then started doing laundry. IT WORKS GREAT!!! We did notice the water intake hose was a little flimsy but nothing a little ingenuity couldn't figure out. We attached a rubber band and a black hair tie (girls you know the one) to the faucet to keep it tight and hold it up.-----SEE END OF MY POST REGARDING THE HOSE----- I've been doing laundry since 3pm 1/15. It's now 4pm 1/16. And it's still going strong!! PROS: Small and convenient Very light Spinner gets clothes relatively dry Timer GETS CLOTHES CLEAN Very powerful agitator Only need to use about 1 tbls to 2tbls of detergent. SAVE ON DETERGENT!!! Spinner will automatically shut off if someone opens the door, (SAFE FOR LITTLE FINGERS) The amount that fits in the spin dryer is what you're supposed to put in the washer. If the washer is too full anyway it won't agitate. CONS: Not really a con but it is small, but not too small. Just can't do big blankets but HEY it's a washer right?? Water pump isn't too powerful, you will have to elevate it to make sure to get all the water out of the hose Hoses are flimsy but nothing a little ingenuity can't overcome-----SEE THE BOTTOM OF MY POST!!! Yes, the longer clothing/linen items may come out a little tangled but just watch it if it becomes too tangled. The lint dryer doesn't really work--SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY PURCHASING A LINT BRUSH I understand that this product came out only a year ago so I'm sure they're still working out the bugs over there at the Panda factory (always wanted to say that) and will come out with an even better and more amazing one. The lint trap for instance, doesn't really work. I found that washing clothes by themselves that are lint magnets will help with the lint. Washing clothes that produce lint on their own helps even more. This washer is great, I can't give it enough stars. We did purchase the warranty for it just in case but It's done well over 100 loads now and we haven't had any problems. I don't know how I've ever lived without it. This IS NOT a fully automatic washer. YOU WILL NEED TO DO WORK. However, if you've been handwashing your clothes(like me), don't have access to a laundromat, don't have a ton of money to spend, don't have a laundry hook-up, and want your clothes clean, GET THIS WASHER. We went though all the other brands searching through reviews and videos, this one by far is the best for the money. We have it now semi permanently in the bathroom. I put the waste water hose in the toilet with the seat on it and the intake hose is connected to the faucet. This is truly an amazing machine. Don't waste time thinking about it, just purchase one and see for yourself!!! UPDATE!!!! 2/11/14 It's not a month later and this washer is STILL GOING STRONG!!! I use it EVERY SINGLE DAY for about 5+ loads. That means this baby has to work sometimes up to 6 hours a day!!! Depending on how many times I wash. We use cold water, sometimes a little stain remover if need be. BUT IT GETS THE CLOTHES CLEAN EVERY TIME!!!! I cannot reiterate how much I love this washer. Hoses are still flimsy however I just purchased a shower diverter and a long shower hose to run across the bathroom to the tub. I know this will work fine. I will update again in a few months, we'll see how it's doing then..... UPDATE 5/15/2014 I purchased and just set up this washer for my mother in law who has arthritis. She said it's brilliant! Mine is still working, no qualms with it, works just as well as the day that I got it. A few more tips: Keep the doors open to allow the machine to dry out when you're not using it. This prevents mold from developing. ALSO.... !!!!I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY METAL RING THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE ZIPPER BAG!!! It's a clamp, silly me. You put it around the plastic tubing and clamp it to your sink. No need for hair ties, tape, etc. Works brilliantly, wish I figured this out sooner!!!", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "About two days after I received this washer and pretty much washed everything in my apartment, I sent a picture of it to the person I'm dating with the caption: \"I have a new love now. Sorry.\" It's now two months later, and the love affair is still going strong. I've read many reviews \"complaining\" about minute things like the lint catcher being pointless, how long it takes to wash etc., but I've rated this five stars because of what it does for what it is. It's not the giant Maytag at the laundromat, and if you want that, then this most certainly isn't the washer for you. However, if what you want is to do laundry in the comfort of your own tiny apartment (I live on the third floor of a Brownstone in Brooklyn) without spending oodles of money on dropping off laundry at the laundromat, or dealing with crowds in a narrow space where you have to compete for washers, dryers and folding space, then you will LOVE this thing. It has changed my life. REASONS I LOVE THE PANDA COMPACT PORTABLE: *This washer is powerful! I have bought the mesh washing bags as others have recommended, and it is the best idea (for those of you having issues with lint -- separating and using the mesh bags solves for that). You'd think that as small as it is it wouldn't do much, but it has a very strong agitator and gets the job done in a short amount of time. I recently spilled red wine all over a white tank, pre-treated with detergent, baking soda and peroxide for about 30 minutes and threw in the washing machine and the stain was all gone. *It saves me from going to the laundromat. I used to do drop-off service at $12-$15 a pop (this washer will have paid for itself in 4 months or less). It was \"convenient,\" but after having things lost, or other people's random items being included in my laundry, I was dreaming of a better way that I didn't see happening, and I'm so grateful for this as an alternative. For many reasons I would wash my own underwear, and still I would avoid the laundromat like the plague. I have a lifetime supply of panties because I'd rather buy more underwear than go to the laundromat, even just to throw my underwear in the washer and come back and pick them up when they're done. (I let them air dry.) No more lugging massive bags up and down 4 flights of stairs every week and walking around the corner with a massive bag on my back like some weird urban Santa Claus! *I can use my own eco-friendly, non-irritating detergents and fabric softeners. I essentially had to use whatever they did in the laundromat even though I would never use those products on my own. I make my own fabric softener (water, vinegar, baking soda and essential oils) and I feel so much better about everything. *I can take my time. It absolutely takes time to do laundry with this machine, but as another reviewer posted, whatever amount of time it takes is infinitely better than the nonsense you go through in the laundromat. I hate doing laundry in the laundromat, but the convenience of this machine changes the whole experience for me. I can be naked and do my laundry all day; I don't care about the time. *I can wash pretty much everything in it. Like someone said, you need to do smaller loads, which I'm fine with. I wash all my sheets and duvet covers with ease. The only things I can't wash are my comforters (which I only wash twice annually since I use duvet covers) and large winter coats (again, not frequently washed). Such items will go to the drop-off as needed (i.e. maybe twice annually). Those are the main things I can think of off the top of my head, but they're big ones. The lint catcher does suck, but who friggin' cares?! ***PEOPLE. THIS THING COSTS LESS THAN $200! YOU CAN HAVE A WASHER AT HOME FOR LESS THAN THE COST OF AN IPHONE UNDER CONTRACT!*** Think about that for a second. Do you know how much you'd have to spend to \"set it and forget it?\" I've spent WAY more on less efficient or convenient things, and I'm sure you have, too. This is all about perspective. My biggest \"complaint\" is that it *IS* pretty loud, but I've thought of/read about some workarounds for that; all of which still make this washer worth it. The pros FAR outweigh the cons of this washer (which are few and minuscule), and I am so happy to have it. I've been telling everyone about it! If you're a New Yorker who lives in a walk-up and hates the laundromat -- this one's for you! UPDATED TO INCLUDE INFO ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES: Spin Dryer: I just read a couple reviews of people saying the spin dryer was a \"joke\" because it does not contain heat and doesn't get your clothes dry. I died laughing as I have NO IDEA why anyone would think it DID that. It doesn't say that it does. These people clearly didn't read the reviews or watch the video as suggested under the product details because if they did, they would know that it is basically a more advanced version of the spin cycle in a commercial washer in that it gets most of the water out of your clothes so that you can spend less time drying it in a machine, or air drying it. It's not supposed to get them bone dry. Further, this thing costs less than $200. Did you really think it would have a heated dryer? That's a lot to ask of a washing machine/spinner combo that costs less than $200. Lint: If you have problems with lint, use the mesh bags and sort your laundry. This helps tremendously. I had lint galore the first couple times I used the washer, but once I got the mesh bags, it has significantly reduced. I still see some lint, but it's not anything a few shakes or a quick pass with a lint roller won't cure. \"Shredded clothes\": The agitator is quite strong, so again, use the mesh bags. Noise: If you live in an apartment building, the washer can be loud on the floor. One way to solve for this would be to use a thick exercise/yoga mat or two. I wash in the bathroom, so I use a thick bath rug most times. \"Crunchy clothes\": I use my homemade fabric softener (water, vinegar, baking soda and essential oils) as well as Borax in the wash. Makes all the difference, even for the towels, and also has helped with the lint (which I see in the washer and not on my clothes anymore). They still have some crunch, but very little. I'm planning on purchasing the dryer companion shortly!", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Just got delivered today. I am a spinner and I had some fleece pre-soaked and ready to wash. Which is one of the reasons I got the Panda as it is not an automatic washer. I soaked the fleece in the wash water, spun out the soapy water in the spin side for 1 minute and repeated 2X more. Then rinsed and spin, repeated until the water was clear and then spun for the full 5 min after the final rinse. It was very dirty fleece. Stuff I almost threw away. The spin dryer spun so much of the filth out of the fiber I will be able to spin this wool and use it. Maybe not for fine clothing, but it IS spinnable and usable. Next I did a full load of laundry. It was very dirty light clothing. A few lightweight skirts and some tees and undies. I washed for the full 15 min and then rinsed twice in the wash side and then switched to the spin side wetting fabric a bit between each 1 min cycle then when the water came out clear I spun for 4 minutes as that was enough and no more water was coming out of the drain tube. Yes, this machine requires a bit of user input and work to operate, but then you have full control over the wash and rinse cycles. My clothes did not come as clean as I like at the laundromat and due to a nasty dryer some of my clothes got nasty oily streaks on them. Along with the soap I used which is Charlie's Soap as it is made to get out such stuff it came out. The wash action is superb. Even with a full load it got great agitation. Most washer at full capacity don't agitate well. Even the front loaders. To get dirty laundry clean you must only fill them half full to get enough agitation. Which costs a lot at the Laundromat. The savings amount to 10 dollars a week and that adds up to 520 dollars a year. I did not count the gas it takes to get there or the coffee/sodas and lunch as that is offset by the cost of the electric and water to operate the machine. And I do laundry when we go for groceries anyway. It will still pay for itself in less than 6 months. And it uses less detergent. So, there is a savings there. I put the laundry liquid in an old dish soap bottle to accurately measure it and then with the really dirty stuff it is easy to squirt in a bit more until you get suds again. It only took a small bit dribbled in. They only let you give a product 5 stars. If I could I would give it 10 stars. Watch the video on YouTube to see it in action. There is no way I can get my clothes as clean washing by hand and I know just from the sweet smell, clean and bright colors and the feel as I was hanging them to dry they are CLEAN and not still half dirty as per the Laundromat in town. They used to get cleaner but to save dollars and make more dollars the Laundromats cut the soak cycle and a rinse cycle. I am very pleased with my short try out today. I can't say enough to praise this affordable and highly efficient washing machine. Some are automatic and take less work, but cost a lot more. More automation means less control and more electricity to operate and more money to buy. This is a very Green product. I will gladly do the extra work necessary that this machine requires. This baby ROCKS!", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "This little washer is quite impressive for the cost. Now let's be honest for a moment , if your the type of person that drops in a metric ton of clothes to wash each cycle ... you are going to have to change your ways. This little guy won't be able to process large amounts of laundry at one cycle. Its made for small loads but it does them very well , in fact compared to much more expensive solutions it does them better than I ever thought a 15 minute wash cycle could actually clean. The only things required for this compact washer are : 1. A sink with a standard nozzle to attach the water feed hose to 2. A standard 120V outlet (it uses only a small amount of power compared to a full size washer) 3. A bit of patience. I recommend you go head over to Youtube and watch the first video that pops up under search. The lady in that video does an excellent job on explaining on how to process a small load of laundry. For the freedom that little washer provides it more than pays for itself. In fact if you pair it with a nice portable dryer , you get the total solution. Yes , it does require a bit more manual labor , you have to make sure you drain it completely after each cycle. I recommend lifting it up next to the sink you are using and snaking the drain hose at the bottom of the sink. This will aid the electric drain motor in quickly flushing out all the left over water and makes for a simple clean up. To be honest I didn't think this little guy would work out that great but it truly is a simple solution that with a little extra work completely eliminates the need to hit up your local laundromat (this is a big plus if its an apartment laundromat) minus the large loads of sheets and such. The only downside is that the spin cycle is a bit loud and if it becomes unbalanced it will cause the machine to start dancing. I've found that simply turning off the spin cycle and adjusting the clothing helps a lot but also consider moving the machine to a carpeted floor where it will have more padding and that should also help with the noise. Thankfully the machine spins so fast it doesn't need more than 5 minutes to whip out the access water from your clothes so the extra noise is only for a short period of time. Panda also bent over backwards to help me when I entered the incorrect shipping address and was able to intercept it in time to make sure it went to the new address. Very impressed with that level of service. Also Amazon helped with that process as well but I expect that level of service , this is why I buy products on Amazon to begin with. If you need a portable solution for washing your clothes , then this is it at this price range.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I am a college student living in a small apartment with my boyfriend. It was extremely troublesome to walk all the way over to the laundromat. A lot of the times, we would be so busy with school that we couldn't do laundry until it was well overdue. I decided to buy the Panda compact washer/dryer after reading a lot of reviews about it. Going to the laundromat every week for washing our clothes was expensive. Plus, we rarely carry cash, so getting quarters was always such a pain. The Panda washer/dryer arrived early in the morning, sooner than expected. It was also heavier than we anticipated it to be (in the box). Once we got it out of the box and took off all the other shipping stuff, we had to figure out where to put it. The washer/dryer is actually bigger than we thought it would be. So big, that it just simply could not fit into our bathroom properly (without causing issues with us walking around in there). We decided to put it in our kitchen, which might not sound appealing to some. Getting used to the Panda was very stressful at first. The only place we could fit it was the kitchen, so the tube that expels the water has to go up into the sink. This made draining difficult, and the tube slipped multiple times, spilling water everywhere. To fix that issue, though, I bought water resistant Command strips. In the end, I used all four of them from the pack. Two for underneath the tube, and two to strap it in place on top of it. It's very sturdy now and I can use the washer and dryer without worrying that the water will spill everywhere. We've had the item for about a week now and I'm very impressed with it. We did end up buying a over-the-tub drying rack for our clothes. I can wash all our underwear/socks/bras within two days, only doing approx. 2-3 loads a day. I did follow the advice of another reviewer on here, who recommended leaving the Panda on Wash while drying clothes. This way, I can save the water for extra loads. It doesn't take much detergent to get the stuff smelling great and clean. The spinner and washer sections were actually BIGGER than I imagined. This morning, I was washing our shirts and put approx 4-5 shirts in the wash, then transferred them over to the spin side. The spinner had absolutely no problem drying this sort of load, and when they came out, they were just slightly damp. Other reviewers said they couldn't put much clothing inside the device at all, but I kind of find this to be an exaggeration. One of the loads of my underwear/socks/bras didn't even come near the weight \"Capacity\" that the washer/spinner has. I actually find I am able to wash a lot more than other reviewers stated. Furthermore, after the issues with the tube was corrected, I've found it to be very pleasant. At first, I was scared that the noise from the machine would upset the neighbors. However, I have discovered that the washing and drying are not too noisy at all. I think the first time you load something into them, like, the first few seconds, the machine is a little bit noisy. Once it gets into its groove though, it's fairly quiet. I can go into the bedroom and won't even hear it running from the kitchen. I guess this would depend where you put it though. I put a bathroom carpet beneath the Panda to help it out. Not only is the carpet soft to the touch, but it stabilizes the machine more and offsets some of the noise. For anyone thinking about buying this, I really recommend it. It's been a savior. We no longer have to walk in the heat multiple times for hours to change over the laundry. Our apartment bill includes electric and water, so we don't have to worry about how much we use for the item. I think if you have the same sort of conditions we do, you will find that the Panda is a blessing, even if it takes a little bit longer (from home) to do the laundry. Doing a little laundry at a time is key, really. I do about three-four small loads a day and have almost done all the overdue laundry in our apartment. It was definitely worth the money! ----- UPDATE: 10/11/13 So I've had this for almost a full month now and have used it countless times. I think my only one complaint about the unit is how (since I have it set up in the kitchen) water can get backed up. I recently purchased a EK Manual Hand Siphon Pump for 4.99 (for some reason Amazon couldn't find the product link) in hopes that I could use it to siphon out any residual water. The backed up water is primarily seen in the spin side of the unit. It seems like, if the siphon works, this could be a very simple fix for getting out trapped water. I mentioned in my original review that I use command strips to secure the drain tube into our sink. This has worked for the most part, but I've recently had to adjust it and add tape. It seems fairly sturdy, but I do wish there were better options to secure it. Since we live in an apartment, we can't just use anything to fix it to the sink, as Velcro attachments (probably the best option for this sort of thing) could tear the paint off of the side of the counter top. In terms of durability and how clean it gets the clothing, this unit is fantastic. I've washed so many loads of laundry with it and haven't had any frustrations. It also doesn't take up as much detergent as a laundromat unit would, so the things we actually purchase to wash clothes last far longer than they normally would. I did purchase a drying rack that goes over the tub in our apartment. For shirts, I will hang them on hangers over the tub. Anything else, like underwear, towels, etc, I use on the drying rack. Only spinning multiple things (3-4 shirts at a time, or a handful of underwear/socks) in the spin side for 3 minutes, the clothes get fairly dry. They do not have dripping water when they are pulled out at all. Because of this, I am able to safely transport them from the kitchen to the bathroom and hang them to air dry. The clothes get completely dry overnight, and do not need a fan or anything on them to have this happen. I will continue to update at a later date.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "Length:: 2:59 Mins I have been using this Panda Compact Washer for almost three weeks now with both light and heavier loads with GREAT results. It is now *super* convenient to be able to do almost all of my laundry at home, plus with all costs considered the savings will be VERY significant versus using coin-op machines. The directions it comes with are sort of vague so I've come up with a neat four step system to get a load done: 1. Wash: Fill the Panda washer with water to a little over the halfway mark, making sure the drainage hose (on the right of the machine) is UP and *securely* connected to the side of the washer unit. To fill the washer easily, I added a diverter+hose attachment to my shower head to fill the washer ( RapidBath Deluxe Dog Bathing System). Add soap and clothing, keeping in mind \"less is more\" here - once you've set the timer and see how it is going, you can always add more water, soap, and/or clothing. To turn the unit on, turn the timer from 1-15 minutes depending on how long you want to pre-soak or wash the load. Presoaking helps; I tend to load it at night with what I've used/worn for the day, set for 3-5 minutes, leave it soaking then continue the load in the morning. Everything comes out very clean, fresh smelling and uses very little detergent. 2. Rinse: If your clothes were only lightly soiled and you want to re-use the soapy water just remove the clothes from the Panda and rinse in the tub - a large colander style basket and a hose helps here. If you will *not* be reusing the soapy water you can simply rinse the clothes by adding fresh water to the Panda washer while the hose is still in the tub for continuous drainage. This action is low tech/gravity driven - the hose must drain to a spot lower than its base. 3. Wring - or Not: If you don't want to hand wring, let the clothes sit in either the washer (drained), or tub for 5-10 minutes or more. 4. Dry: I use a Centrifugal Clothes Portable Spin Dryer to remove as much water as possible and then hang to dry. For me, each load can hold about 2 days worth of clothes, except in the case of jeans or heavy bath towels which I have been doing in very small loads which means those articles pretty much wash by themselves. After a run through the spin dryer I hang the clothes on a Minky X-Wing Indoor Drying Rack, 45-Feet Total Drying Space, White and everything is always is dry in just a few hours time. I have only had this washer for a couple of weeks but at this rate it will have paid for itself within 3-4 months. It seems pretty sturdy though and as you can see from how well the agitator moves it can do a really good job at cleaning the clothes as long as it is loaded properly. My only slight hesitation in recommending this unit is the unknown factor as far as how long it will last but I'm happy having saved so many trips to the laundromat already and would definitely purchase again if for some reason it fails outside the six month warranty. For how well it functions, ease of use, and the price point I'll say I am VERY pleased with this purchase and easily give the Panda Compact Washer five stars.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "First off, I have to preface this by saying I have purchased the Wonder Washer and was greatly disappointed. This thing is a 100x better than the Wonder Washer. I own both and could not believe I wasted my money on the other washer. My needs were simple - a small washer that could wash normal items like jeans, sheets, pillow cases, bath towels... you name it. This is the washer that can do it. If you are living in a small apartment or are on a budget and are tired of schlepping clothes to the laundry every week or the endless hunt for quarters - this is for you. The washer is the perfect size to sit on a counter top. I put mine on my kitchen counter next to the sink when I need to do the laundry. The washer is actually fairly lightweight and comes with an easy carry handle, so moving it is not difficult. It also has a top fill hole with a hose. I strongly recommend swapping the hose it comes with with a REAL hose. Go to your local aquarium supply or hardware store and purchase one. I think it takes a standard 1/2\" hose. Any high quality flexible rubber hose or PVC hose should do. You will also want a faucet adapter or something to fit snug into your faucet. For me, the aquarium hose I had worked perfect and was able to wedge into my faucet spigot tight enough to allow easy filling. The drain works fine. You can see it hanging on the right of the stock photo of the unit. I didn't even realize the unit had a fill hose and drain until it arrived. I guess I missed it in the description, but it works great. The washer itself is just the right size. The motor is amazingly strong. You can easily throw a beach towel or something like a queen size duvet sheet in there and wash it. It pulls through like a champ. Jeans work great too. To give you an idea, the 5.5lb capacity is about a regular men's pair of jeans or a single queen size duvet sheet or about two queen size flat sheets or two regular bath towels. It is more about wet water weight than anything. So if it absorbs a lot of water and gets heavy quickly, it may slow down some. A large sheet can be done, but you will need to fill the tank to 3/4 capacity with water before you add the sheet. Then push it under water so that it is covered. The key on larger items is to make sure there is enough water so that it always spins freely. So keep that in mind. Anything smaller like shirts, khakis or anything else will be a breeze. You will have to do multiple loads or get used to doing loads daily. But the convenience to me is worth it. My apartment was smaller and did not come with any hookups. The nearest laundry is about 3 miles away and closed early. I was always needing rolls of quarters and the local store was out or didn't have enough to spare. So things just never seemed to work out right for anything laundry related being convenient. This was the perfect solution. Also do yourself a favor and purchase the matching spin dryer. It is totally worth it. If you have to choose one, buy the dryer first. The dryer will not get your clothes 100% dry, but it eliminates a good 80-90% of the water to the point things are slightly damp. So a quick 10 minute air dry can usually dry your clothes after that (besides jeans that is).", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I was very hesitant to purchase the machine, especially since there were no reviews yet on amazon. I was leaning towards buying the electric wonder washer but it only held about 2 pounds of clothes. Since this panda machine held 5 pounds, I decided to cross my fingers and go for this one. I just received it and have only done about 4 loads in it and I'm very impressed. The machine is made of good materials, alot of dirt comes out of the clothes, and the smelled very nice and looked clean coming out. You can fit quite alot of clothes in there too like 8 t-shirts and a bunch of undergarmets, and pajamas or a couple pairs of jeans and shirts. In the instructions, after the wash cycle (that can be set anywhere between a minute-15 minutes depending on how soiled the clothes are ), it recommends that you wash the clothes with plain water for a rinse cycle but I found it to be quicker to just throw the clothes in the bathtub and rinse while I was doing the next load in the machine. The only con of this machine is that the clothes are soaking wet when it comes out the machine which means you have to wring dry the clothes. Because I did 4 loads in one day, I got a little lazy wringing the clothes out and some of them took quite a while to dry (over 24 hours) but through research, I've found that the solution for that is ordering a spin dryer (through laundry alternative/amazon) which extract over 90% of the water. If you don't have one of those and/or you're not planning on getting one, just make sure you wring out the clothes as much as you can. Overall, I am pleased with it. I'm tired of loading up huge bags into a taxi and heading to the laundrymat. I live in a small apartment so it fits my needs just fine. I can already tell that my life will be much easier with this machine. If anyone's interested in seeing how well it works, there are a couple youtube videos that show the panda machine in action. Once I receive the spin dryer, I'll update the review to include how the two work together...but so far so good. I'm about to do a couple more loads tonight.. and I'm kind of looking forward to it..which is a good thing. The Panda washer is cute, sturdy, and does the job. The blue, white, and black design goes perfectly with my bathroom decor so I'm happy.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "This is a great mini washer and well worth the money. I did purchase it from the Canadian site mentioned in one review([...]). Why because the price came to $99 total with shipping. It got here in ONLY 2 days. I did't have a spinner (by Laundry Alternatives) at the time. They were on back order. I finally got it. GET ONE these spinner is well worth it. Pros: Fast 15 minute cycle, Small/Compact, Gets clothing clean. Cons: Drain hose is exceedingly too short, I will be replacing it with a longer version. NOISY, this thing is very noisy, it's a loud growling noise. Some reviews complain about it not rinsing, 1. Drain dirty water. 2. Refill with clean water 3. Drain rinse water 4. Refill with clean water 5. Drain, there rising done. This is what a full size washer does. This will save you money because it uses less water and you can do small loads of laundry and not have any piles hanging around. Also you use about a 10th of the laundry detergent you use in a full size washer. People claim it doesn't get clothing clean. Two things, 1. Treat items with a spot treater like Spray n Wash, Oxy clean spray, Resolve, Shout,Fels naptha soap, let them sit 5 minutes then wash that works well or 2. If item is still stained after wash, put it through 2nd wash cycle, it's only 15 minutes after all. This gets clothing amazingly clean I am very pleased it this and no piles hanging around. I have yet to do a thin blanket or sheet in it yet, it is just great. This is an average load that works well with it. 4 shirts, pair of socks, 1 smaller bath towel, 1 wash cloth, 1 large swimmer towel. As long as the clothing moves freely in the wash tub it will get the clothing clean. I love watching how it washes clothing. Also if anyone that has done laundry and I've been doing it since my brother showed me when I was 9 years old I am 42 years old now, knows what they are doing and if you are washing delicates you put them in a bag of some kind of (mesh laundry bag or zippered pillow case) to make sure they do not get damaged. Some have said you need to get a hose for your sink or bath tub faucet, I would agree, I installed faucets (long before I knew what a Panda Mini Washer was) that the water areator its self is a hose sprayer so I just pull it out and fill it. I would agree with them, you do need this or one that connects up and you can fill it. It is a lot easier. Well worth it BUT...Needs longer drain hose. *************UPDATE DRAIN HOSE DIRECTIONS UPGRADE 6/10/2012************************** I have extended the hose on the Panda Mini Washer, here is what you will need. One (1) 5 Foot or longer section of clear vinyl tubing 3/4\" x O.D. (Outside Diameter) X 5/8\" ID (Inside Diameter)(Amazon sells this for $29.70 per 100 feet, you might find a local store (like Fleet Farm or Menards) that sells this in whatever length you want. Even at Amazon's price it is well worth it) Two (2) 3/4\" pipe clamps One (1) Garden Hose Coupling 3/4\" FH x 3/4\" O.D. (vinyl, nylon or plastic metal is too heavy)(I used Watts brand) One (1) Nylon Hose Barb Adapter 5/8\" I.D. x 3/4\" M/P (I used Watts brand) Removing the small plastic hose that is already attached to the Panda Mini Washer (PMW) is NOT recommmended, it voids your warranty and it is affixed very securely. 1. Remove the PMW's hose keeper by slightly bending the plastic hose, you will no longer need it. Store this in a safe place if you need to revert back to the PMW's original configuration. 2. Screw the Garden Hose Coupling to the Nylon Hose barb, make sure the washer is in place in side the Garden Hose Coupling. 3. Put One (1) 3/4\" pipe clamp on the PMW's plastic hose and One (1) 3/4\" pipe clamp on the clear vinyl tubing. 4. Put the 5/8\" Nylon hose barb adapter on to the clear vinyl tubing and close the 3/4\" pipe clamp. 5. Now place the 3/4\" Garden hose coupling on to PMW's drain hose. Close the 3/4\" pipe clamp. Your Panda Mini Washer now has a longer hose and can be filled with water just below the \"Mini\" name plate any higher and it leaks out between the blue wash tub and the lid/time control top. This really made a big difference in how well it washed the clothing and No more water spilling out the drain hose. REMEMBER TO PUT THE NEW LONGER DRAIN HOSE HIGHER THAN THE LEVEL OF THE WASHER OTHERWISE YOUR WASHER WILL DRAIN THE WATER OUT.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "There are three parts to this review and I will try to keep this short and precise. Quality of the product itself: 1) It is quite unbelievable how this product is worth $99. When I first opened the box, I thought I received a 5 lb toy. The plastic is thin and flimsy, not to mention that it is not even spinning, just like what the other reviewer had stated in his/her one star review. Having lived in Asia for many years, I can venture a guess how much this product REALLY is worth... sadly, I have to say, this thing is WAY overpriced. The margins are HIGH!!! 2) As shown in the pictures, there were cracks and \"fractures\" all over the machine, possibly due to damage during delivery. There are also leakages everywhere, which I honestly believe that it could be a safety hazard if the water goes into the motor and electric wires, and apparently was evident after we unscrewed the thing. 3) As an attempt to reconstruct this damaged product since it's already broken anyway, we took it apart and played with it. We ended up using the glue gun to repair the leakages and fix the motor belt so that it is aligned with the spinning wheel - right now we are giving it a test run as I am typing this. Will see if it works without flooding the bathroom. Packaging: 1) There is no bubble wrap or any kind of protective layers of packaging other than a thin paper box which is what it comes in with. I am positive that this contributes to the several areas of damage to the machine, and that's truly a pity. I have initially posted several pictures demonstrating the cracks and damages, but was later contacted by the seller, asking me to remove them. Taking into the consideration that the majority of the buyers seemed to have a great experience with this machine, I honored her request and took the pictures off. Email me privately if you are interested in seeing those pictures. Seller: 1) The seller is certainly worth complimenting. A representative, Christine emailed me back almost 5 minutes later when I first asked for a replacement. Prompt feedback, good customer service, and agreed to give me a full refund for the damaged product. At least the seller is willing to work with the customers and provide the help needed.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "My small condo does not have room for a washing machine and the laundry facility for the complex is too small for the number of appartments. I ended up doing some personal items by hand in between with mixed results. A friend suggested one of those gadgets that look like an oversized blender which she used for her lingery and some other small items. It seemed to work ok but it was rather small. When I researched it on the internet I came across this little gem and ordered it instead. I liked the larger capacity and the drain made it easier to empty the water. The Panda does not have a spin cycle so I bought the table top spin dryer along with it. That was about 6 months ago and I have not made a single trip to the laudramat since then.(I will have to go there for the flannell sheets, rugs, sofa slip covers, etc) It holds about a third of a normal sized load. Since the \"cycles\" can be modified depending on how soiled the items are I noticed that clothes are getting visibly cleaner than with the \"one wash fits all\" of the commercial washing machines.I pre soak or pre wash stained items and double or triple rinse everything to remove detergent residue which dulls the colors and makes whites look gray after a while. After some trial and error I found the best way to do my laundry is to put a large plastic foot stool inside the bathtub (use an old towel or rubber mat under it to prevent scratches) and place the washer on top of it.It should sit securely, Use the hand shower to fill it and drain the water right into the tub when done. I usually wring the clothes lightly by hand before and between rinsings but you can use the spin dryer instead. After a final spin they are just damp and ready to hang to dry. From start to finish it takes a little longer than the usual 30 minute cycle, but I don't have to sit in a basement forever waiting for a machine to become available and I can do other things around the appartment instead. The Panda has made my life easier and has payed for itself many times over. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I'd first like to thank all the generous reviewers who provided helpful, descriptive reviews and/or videos. I wouldn't have purchased this little washer without being able to consult those reviews and instructional videos. As mentioned by others, be aware that the vigorous washing action can make a copious amount of suds out of very little detergent, so until you've had more experience with the Panda, start off using even less soap than the small amount recommended -- you can always add more if needed. Also, the machine agitates briefly in one direction, then pauses and agitates in the opposite direction, which results in more vibration than if it agitated continuously and smoothly throughout the cycle. I mention this because apartment dwellers might want to be aware that the vibration caused by the start-stop agitation can be disruptive to neighbors. I just make sure I use it during daytime hours only, and all is well. I love that I can use the Panda to soak some items for an effective period of time without inconveniencing my neighbors by stopping the cycle to allow for soaking when using our shared laundry room washers. With its surprisingly strong agitation, the Panda gets clothes much cleaner than using our building's commercial washers. The only downside is rinsing and wringing out your cleaned clothing, but I've now managed a workable routine. When using the machine, I place it on a small, sturdy square plastic bench next to the bathtub at tub-edge height, and let it do its work there. Then, after unhooking the hose and letting it down to drain into the bathtub, I use my Showerpik shower head to run clean water into the machine while it's still draining. Once the draining water is fairly clear of suds, I fill the machine once more with clean water and a bit of white vinegar and let it agitate briefly to rinse thoroughly. After draining a final time, I let the clothes sit in the machine for a bit while the drain tube is still down in the bath. About half an hour later, there's not even a trickle coming from the hose, and I find that my clothes have surprisingly little water left to wring out manually. One handy hint: Using about a quarter of a cup of white vinegar in the rinse water helps remove soap residue from clothes, and vinegar's anti-bacterial/anti-fungal properties means that your clothes won't get funky and mildewed if you forget and leave them in the machine for a few hours. Vinegar is also a natural fabric softener, and rinses out thoroughly, so your clothes are soap-free and softer, all without any residual vinegar smell. It also keeps your machine and its tubes soap-residue free, and again, its anti-fungal properties keep the machine smelling clean. Thanks again, fellow reviewers, for all the helpful info that allowed me to make the decision to invest in this amazingly effective little washer. P.S. Delivery was prompt, and all parts were packed well and in working order. However, I couldn't use the washer immediately because the chemical smell from the plastic was so overwhelming and toxic-smelling that I had to put it out on my deck to air for a few days before bringing it back inside. Even so, the smell was still unpleasantly overwhelming. Makes me concerned about the health of the employees who work in the plants where these machines are manufactured... 5/16/13 Update: The instructions that come with the Panda mention unscrewing the agitator plate at the inside bottom of the washer from time to time, to remove any lint/strings that might slow down agitation. I can get the screw out, but the plate won't come off, so I can't clean it.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I received my Panda washer this week, and have done about five loads of wash. Overall, it does the job well. yes, it is more labor intensive than an automatic washer, but this isn't an automatic washer. I think the reviewers who complain that it is too much work have never had to do a lot of laundry by hand. I live and travel full time in a 27 foot rv, and I needed something small to travel with because going to the laundromat just blows. When my kids were little I did six months of washing all our laundry by hand in a five gallon bucket with a plunger, and I don't really care to go that route again. The pros: *Small and light, easy to set up and move around *Does a good job getting the clothes clean. Rather than do a pre-soak, like some do, I prefer to do a 12-15 minute wash and rinse twice. *Holds a lot more clothes than you realize. My first load was 10 undies, a bra, three light cotton dresses, two light cotton skirts and two cotton shirts. Everything came out clean. *The flat agitator is amazingly efficient, just as efficient as a stand-up agitator. *VERY quiet. I was concerned the noise might bother my neighbors but I barely even hear it when it is running. *At 170 watts I can use it with my solar system if necessary. The cons: *The hoses are crap. I've seen kiddie toys with better quality hoses than they put on this thing. I know they are trying to keep costs down, but they need to spend the extra few pennies and upgrade the quality of the hoses. My fill hose burst on the second load due to water pressure, and I was only using about 25% pressure. *The fill hose is supposed to fit over your faucet. I checked it on my kitchen just out of curiosity. I really doubt it would stay on a faucet at full pressure for very long. *The drain hose is just too short, only about 12 inches. I saw a previous reviewer that modified her hoses. Clever, but in my opinion complicated and expensive. here is my mod on the hoses: For fill hose: 1 garden hose female repair end 1 garden hose male to female connector with valve 3 feet 1/2 inch vinyl tubing Gorilla glue Heat two inches of the vinyl tubing over a low flame on the stove until it is warm, not hot or on fire lol. Stick a pair of blunt end scissors up the hot end of the tube and let it cool. Do this a few times until the end of the hose has stretched enough to make a snug fit over the water inlet. Drizzle a thin stream of gorilla glue inside the stretched end of the hose and slip it over the inlet. Clamp in place until the glue dries. After the glue dries, shove the other end of the tubing onto the garden hose repair end and tighten it down. Attach the garden hose valve end to a hose, and connect it to the hose end on the vinyl tubing. You now have an on/off to fill the tub as needed. For drain hose: 3 feet (or more, whatever you need) of 3/4 inch inside diameter vinyl tubing 1 hose clamp Slide the end of the vinyl tube over the end of the drain hose and tighten down the clamp. Drop the drain hose to drain. I still attach to the side with the included clip, but let the now-longer end hang over my drain bucket. Doing one wash and two rinses will use about ten gallons of water. I drain my water into a five gallon bucket and either use it to flush the toilet or water plants (I use biodegradable soap). A little bit of work, but much nicer than the laundromat, I can do the wash while I sit outside and work. As I said, it gets the job done, is fairly simple, and easy to travel with. Also, don't buy it for the \"bonus\" laundry basket, it is just one of those tiny little spring loaded mesh baskets you can buy at the dollar store. **UPDATE 10/7** Yesterday the drain hose sprouted a leak for no apparent reason. I do 3-5 loads a week in this washer. As a tiny washer it works fine, but as stated above, the hoses are crap. If I could go back I would buy a different washer. yes, it does wash the clothes, but the whole cheap hoses thing is a hassle. I bought a few feet of 1 inch diameter vinyl hose and just shoved the whole drain hose inside it, then applied a hose clamp. End of leak. However, I expect it will start leaking from the inside soon at the rate the hoses are breaking down. If that happens I'm just going to take the whole thing apart and add good hoses like it should have had in the first place. For a hundred bucks it should last longer than two months. Also, it's available for less elsewhere without the Panda brand name. Look for RV supplies.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I just bought a brand new machine for my mother about 3 months ago at total cost of $105.39. She didn't use it very often. Today, the machine was totally dead! I contacted the company, and copied some emails from them as followings: \"The Panda mini washer comes with 6 months warranty.\" \"If the product is damaged or defective within 15 days after receiving the product, we will ship the replacement at our costs. We do offer free parts and maintenance instruction within 6 months, but buyer will be pay for the shipping.\" \"Note: Installation of the motor may be difficult, we could request the picture instruction for you, however, we recommend you to ask your friends for help if they have some maintenance skills.\" They told me to check the belt first, and I checked the belt looked no problem. Then they told me the motor was dead...I would have to pay $18 shipping fee and I would have to install a motor by myself!!! I don't have a friend who has such machine maintenance skills.

{"review": "I am living in my RV right now due to a travel assignment, going to the Laundromat is a hassle and expensive. I bought this for the small loads of laundry I have. I was pleasantly surprised. **One tip, do buy mesh laundry bags, as in other reviews it can snag material. I find if I put my laundry in the bags, the bags take on the wear and tear vs. my clothes. By doing that, I have not had an issue with the machine tearing my clothes. The spinner gets the clothes mostly dry. I just hang my clothes on a dry rack for about 30 min to air dry. It's not very loud either. If you live in an RV, small apartment, or any place that does not have a washer/dryer, I do recommend this. Good price for what it does. It is about the same size as a large rubber tote, not too heavy to move around. I was able to get all of my laundry for the week done in less than an hour.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "My office is far away from home and for that reason, I rent a small apartment near work so I am not on the road for 3 hours a day, sleep-deprived. I've been either hauling huge loads of laundry home, where I have a large washer, or going to the local laundromat, neither of which is something I enjoy doing. The local laundry is not only expensive, but filthy and I generally have to clean the machines before I use them -- and even then, things don't come out too clean. After hearing a lot of good comments about the Pandas, I decided to get this little machine. It arrived today and I'm having a blast washing everything dirty I can find in the apartment. Clothes and towels come out very clean and the spin cycle will get your clothes as dry as the spin in a commercial washer. Socks that I had assumed were just soiled beyond hope are clean for the first time in months of washing them at the laundromat. After you hang your wash, it takes about half an hour for your shirts and underclothes to dry. Jeans take a bit longer. For people mechanically challenged like I am, setting it up is a breeze. The water intake on the left is for the washer side of the unit; the one on the right is for your spinner. The drain is self-explanatory ... since this is a gravity drain on this unit, your drain will need to be lower than the unit. I've been draining water in the bathtub. The timer on the washer is nice, too. If you're washing office clothes, you'll have 'em clean in about 3 or 4 minutes. For muddy, dirty work jeans, socks and towels, I've set the timer for 10-15 minutes and all the dirt is washed out. The spinner also has a timer -- just a couple minutes does the trick for most items, as long as you don't fill the spinner too full. Surprisingly, clothes aren't a wrinkled mess after spinning them. For people who can't stand hauling around clothes to the laundry or elsewhere, this portable washing machine is well worth the investment. For the environmentally conscious person, you'll cut down on water consumption and expensive dryers. I highly recommend this unit.", "id": "2383576011"}

I was quite pleased when this product arrived; I was somewhat concerned as the packaging showed damage on the top the although the unit was undamaged. Note: The Pan30 Model is a gravity drain unit, meaning the drain hose MUST BE lower than the machine. Ideal for draining into the sink if the unit is on the counter or into a tub or shower, providing the drain hose is lower than the unit.

{"review": "I love this little washing machine. I live in a small one bedroom apartment in a beach community. There are laundry facilities on site but usually I have small loads and most of my clothes I hand wash or use gentle cycle and hand to dry. This unit works GREAT for me. I keep it out of site in my shower when not using it and that's where I use it too. It's heavy enough to be very sturdy and light enough to easily lift out of the shower for my daily use. I've been using the water extractor feature more than the washing feature. I hand wash a lot of my clothes and put them in the extractor to spin the water out. No squeezing, twisting, or using towels to extract the water. The clothes come out as dry as they would from a regular washing machine. It saves me a great deal of time, money and personal energy as well as a environmental footprint energy. My clothes always come out very clean. In fact cleaner than the public laundry facility.

{"review": "I was SO excited to receive this little thing. We live in a very small apartment and were spending a lot of money at the laundromat, considering the costs of washing, drying, time, and commuting (the only useable laundromat was about 15-20 minutes a day). We were spending approximately 45.00 a week on the laundromat, all told. I ordered this model after reading reviews and looking up reviews on YouTube so I could see exactly how it worked. Used the machine immediately upon arrival (it arrived very quickly...about 4 business days). The first few washes did create a \"plastic\" smell but this odor did not bleed into the clothes. I think it was the same as breaking in a new coffee machine. After several washes now, the smell is gone. I did find it easier to put it in a stationary location, on top of a shelf bought specifically to accommodate the gravity draining system. This works best for me and I use a bucket to fill and empty it. Usually two buckets full does it, but sometimes 2 1/2. I have it just outside my bathroom so this is very simple and easier for me. Don't have to move the machine and having it elevated is much easier. I am giving it four stars only because of a couple concerns. When I contacted the manufacturer about my worries over the lint filter, I got a response within minutes and they asked for my name, order number, date ordered, etc. When I responded with the information, they responded immediately with a photo of the lint filter to make sure they had the right one. I sent a simple \"Yep! That's it!\" and immediately was informed I would be receiving a spare to be shipped out the next day. A follow-up email was sent the next day, letting me know they were sending TWO extra filters. No charge. Make sure you register. I also highly recommend buying the mesh laundry bags (various sizes). I've washed a full queen sheet set: top & bottom sheets, 2 pillow cases and 2 pillow shams.

{"review": "First - note that the dimensions of this pan are top edge to top edge and the sides of the drain pain slope slightly \"up and away\" from the bottom to the top. Our laundry center measures about 27\" side-to-side and 28-1/2\" front-to-back and it fit with about 1\" on the sides and 1/2\" front and back. You can also raise - or shim - the legs on your laundry center to allow the bottom of the machine to clear the top of the drain pain, gaining a little more room if needed (this might make your machine less stable and more prone to vibration on the spin cycle - but most things in life involve tradeoffs). Although raising your machine could place the outside edges of the laundry center enclosure (case) slightly outside the edges of the drain pain, most leaks are going to be inside the laundry center case itself. While the plastic drain pan is flexible plastic, construction seems solid enough for the purpose. I was able to tilt up the back side of the laundry center, slide the drain pan under, then slide the machine back into the pan (helps to brace the back of the pan against something solid so you can push against it). However, it sure would be a lot easier for two (or three) people to put this in place. Our laundry center sits behind a 30\" door so I had to cut away a small portion of the door stop to allow the pan to slide in and out. I have moved this set-up several times with only one problem - the drain line. This drain pan comes with a gasketed 1-1/2\" PVC fitting (you have to cut a hole in the bottom of the pan to install the drain) which allows the pan to be connected to a drain - the pan itself will only hold about 7 gallons of water and a typical laundry center holds at least twice that much. If all the water leaks out of your laundry center, no drain pan will be able to hold the total amount without an outside drain. Fortunately, we have a 2-1/2\" drain centered in the back of our laundry closet. Unfortunately, we had to take off the cover plate for the main drain to allow the pan drain to fit inside. This means we have to tilt the machine forward until the drain line clears the main drain before we can slide the machine out of the closet for service. For most people, this will be a rare occurrence, so shouldn't be too troublesome. I would have preferred that the 1-1/2\" pan drain exit flush with the bottom of the drain pan rather than extending below the bottom - I may solve this problem with a hacksaw if and when I have to move the machine again. Hopefully, that won't happen unless the machine overflows again (twice in 13 years - once too often!).

{"review": "As for the dryer itself, I love it. It fits about the same amount of stuff as I do in a load in the little Panda washer I bought (the PAN30), so it's the perfect size to pair with that. But I did run into one little problem. I'm not deducting any stars because it was something that happened during shipping, and not something that's wrong with the dryer itself. I'm just posting it because it might be helpful to anyone else who might run into the same thing so they know what to do about it. I thought the dryer I received was defective because when I first went to use it it was getting hot but the drum wasn't turning. I called the company's customer service and got an actual, helpful human being on the second ring (a big plus!). She said that it wasn't defective - that it was just something that occasionally happens during shipping, and that she'd email me a picture of what to do about it. I didn't feel like waiting for her email, and assumed from what she said that all it was was that a belt had come off during shipping, so I just took the back panel off the dryer (very easy) and saw that the belt for the drum had indeed slipped off. The belt was very easy to put back around the drum (it's obvious how to put it back on when you're looking at it). I'm not particularly mechanically inclined, but the whole process of taking the back off, putting the belt back on, and putting the back of the dryer back on only took about five minutes. So, if anyone else happens to get one of these and thinks it's defective because the drum isn't turning, don't worry, it's fine. Just take the back off and put the belt back on.", "id": "2383576011"}

{"review": "I absolutely LOVE this Panda mini dryer. It's the perfect match to my Panda washer/spin dryer. Yes, it's compact....it's supposed to be. If you expect to fill with larger loads, you might want to make room for the new larger Panda dryer. But I have to say that Panda made the absolute MOST of the space and offers the largest size drum that could possibly fit in this compact size. The first time I tried it, it did take a few minutes on the hot setting before I felt warmth coming out of the dryer vent (most likely caused by the cold wet clothes). But I was surprised when I checked the clothes and they were already dry....sooner than I'd been led to believe. When 2 pair of stretch jeans were finished, they felt HOT! But this was before getting to the warm or cool down cycle, since I kept moving it back into the HOT part of the dial so things would dry faster. I was also pleased to notice that even after running several loads in a row that the top, sides and back didn't even feel warm on the outside....which tells me that it's well insulated. That's nice since it sits in a small area. It's also very quiet. If you need a compact dryer and can deal with a smaller drum, by all means try this dryer. It arrived on time, was packaged well and worked perfectly right out of the box. My only complaint is that I didn't receive an owner's manual. Hopefully, Panda can send me an online document. Update 2/22/14: Bright and early Saturday morning (very next day), I received scanned copies of the owner's manual by email from Kate at Panda/Sonya. I'm happy and love this little dryer.", "id": "2383576011"}
{"review": "I have this dryer sitting on a craft table in my studio apartment. Notice that it uses less electricity than a standard dryer. A few items (3 shirts) take about 85 minutes to dry in a humidity controlled environment. The lint filter can be removed, but I suggest just taking the crevice tool on the vacuum and vacuuming off the lint in place. It is not necessary to remove the filter. That cleaning task takes about 5 minutes, when you feel that it needs to be done. The dryer dumps a bunch of semi-moist warm air into the room, so be prepared to either use a dehumidifier or open a door to the outside. I have a cheap humidity meter and live in a temperate climate, so keeping moisture under control is no problem. My clothes come out much softer and more wrinkle-free than line drying. When I dry my jeans, it is one pair at a time. Sometimes there is a moist spot where the jeans stay folded when drying, but that's easily fixed by throwing the jeans in for more dry time.

The larger dryers and washers are great, but you have either small loads cause you need something or your loads are large.

{"review": "I'm really glad I bought this little dryer, though I'm not even close to the target demographic. I have a full size laundry set on the lower level of my house (in a dedicated laundry room no less!), but we got the old machines when we bought the house last year, and they were not quite up to my modern laundry diva standards. I'm a terrible housekeeper, but laundry is the only one of the necessary evils of home care that I don't actually hate. My new house also has a little laundry closet upstairs off the master bedroom with room for a compact, stackable washer-dryer set. I bought a nice compact washer for upstairs, but I had two qualms about getting a matching dryer. 1) Upstairs would be electric, not gas like the main laundry. Our utility rates are amongst the nation's highest, and I don't want to pay that much for drying clothing just because someone is too lazy to walk downstairs to the \"real\" machines. 2) Upstairs also has the plastic dryer venting going from the closet, through the attic, and outside in an inconvient-to-access place. Eventually, I will replace the fire-hazard plastic venting material, but I don't have the budget to do it now with so many other projects crying out for attention in the new home. Using the 110-V mini Panda dryer must produce less heat, therefore less fire hazard, so so my thinking goes. I hang a lot of my laundry to dry for environmental reasons (and to save wear and tear on finer fabrics) and my intent was to exclusively line dry with the upstairs compact washer. When my inherited-with-the-house dryer died two weeks ago just as the school year ended, planned parties were about to happen, and my house filled with guests... I ordered the Panda dryer and hoped it could see me through a very busy time while I waited for new household units to arrive. I would never compare this little dryer to a full size unit. I don't know that it gets as hot, but it does get hot and dry clothing. I didn't try to cram every item I washed into it, but I did have the option to tumble/fluff the stiff-as-a-board items I'd line-dried previously, and it got the job done every time. Because it is small and less convenient, I don't think other family members will use this at all, and that suits me perfectly. It will take up less space in my laundry closet, leaving more room to put up a shelf for my detergents and letting me avoid storing those in my bedroom or bathroom. I also felt that the luxury of having this little guy meant that I could take my time when picking out my new full-sized machines, and it meant I could afford the extra time lag of ordering them from a less expensive source. With NO laundry options at home, I would've purchased any units available for immediate delivery, because I have two messy boys who spend a lot of time outdoors. I wish the lint filter was easier to clean, but it isn't actually difficult. My mother (one of those houseguests) tells me it is like the ones in the old Maytag dryers she remembers from decades ago. I wish the supplied venting was metal instead of plastic, but I'm happy that they included the pieces that they did. It was easy for me to set the Panda dryer up on my own and get the vent directed out a window so I could work on my laundry backlog without waiting for help to hang it on the wall where it properly goes. My unit came with a faint spot of rust on the exterior top at a seam. I found no evidence of interior rust (that would affect my clothing) so I just accepted it and got on with the laundry. I considered sending it back, but felt that the price was low enough, and my need intense enough, that I could deal with a non-function-impacting defect on the exterior. I don't usually use the Panda to fully dry wet clothing, but I have done so with lightweight and mid-weight items. I haven't tried to dry jeans from fully wet to bone dry. My expectations have been met. Air dry doesn't result in warm clothes, so I'd say it works as described. Warm, which I use most often, results in pleasantly warm items pulled out. I think I've only set the dryer to hot once, just to be sure the dial worked on every setting, so I don't have a lot to say about that setting. I wish the dial felt a little more robust, but any rotary dial strikes me as less likely to need repair than any electronic dryer. I miss the buzzer at the end of the cycle a little bit, but not very much since I'm almost never setting and forgetting laundry upstairs, but rather tumbling nearly dry items that I intend to fold immediately.", "id": "2383576011"}

{"review": "I had always wondered what kind of power these units draw and I finally bought one and, being an engineer, I could not help myself but to measure. Since the unit changes power level based on fans on or off and the internal Peltier device power level, etc., you cannot just measure the current at any given time and multiply out to get the yearly cost to run. I have a plug-in watt-hour meter that tallys a cumulative kilowatt-hour usage over time: this would then account for the on and off cycles for a true-cost-to-run analysis. With the unit in a low humidity steady state 68 degree room and the unit temperature set at 50 degrees, interior led light off and opening the door once for 10 seconds in the test time, it hit 0.43 kilowatt-hours at the 25 hour, 40 minute mark. A little math tells me that in order to run it continuously for a year with one door opening per day, the power draw would be 146.758 kilowatt-hours. At a typical 10 cents per kilowatt hour, that would add up to a cost to operate of $14.68 per year, or about $1.22 added to your monthly electricity bill. $1.22 per month is pretty reasonable and makes me wonder why they do not advertise this on the box or in the literature. They say only that it is a 70 watt device, which is not a continuous rating according to my test (a device that draws 70 watts continuously would cost $61.32 per year to operate!).

{"review": "First time trying this product, and my FIRST wine cooler ever. I do not drink a lot so this is perfect for my pinot noir and expensive colognes. Living in southern CA, it does get pretty warm all year round so this wine cooler keeps my expensive fragrances safe. I accidently left an expensive bottle of cologne in my car one day and it ended up spoiling the whole bottle, the cologne smelled foul afterwards so I realized if I am going to enjoy my fragrances they need to be stored in consistently cool temperatures. Storing them in my drawer or closet is not good enough because it gets pretty warm in my apartment, especially spring/summer and I like my wines like I like my colognes, high quality, but with quality comes a price I am willing to pay. I chose the 8 bottle size because I wanted to hold both my small collection of fragrances and a few wine bottles, so I removed the bottom shelf(slides in/out) so the bottom half of the cooler is capable storing the colognes and the top half I am able to hold 4 bottles of wine which is more than enough for me. Easy plug and use, the controls are nice, self explanatory. I keep my wine/fragrances at 60, though you can set it as low as about 40 if I remember correctly. At 60 it is extremely quite. There is also a control to turn on the interior blue light which makes the cooler look even more ostentatious, if you want to show off or find your way around inside.

I tried putting it in the garage and it was too hot in there so it could not cool down the wine.

{"review": "Sleek, not too large. Great overall design. My only problem is the noise of the cooling motor. It is a subtle, quiet noise, but it's enough to be an annoyance in a very quiet room. And because the unit can't be stored inside a cupboard or other enclosed area, you're stuck with listening to the very faint drone of the motor as it cycles on and off.

We had an issue with it at first that others may need to know about. We originally set it on a counter with the back of the unit about an inch from the wall. After one week, the unit would only cool to 54 degrees, which is just a little too warm to drink chilled wine. I was going to return it to Amazon, but my wife simply moved the unit about 3/4 inch further from the wall, and within an hour or so the unit was at 47 degrees and has now stayed there for several weeks. Apparantly it could not vent properly at 1 inch ffom the wall. This was a simple fix that the instructions did not mention. We are now very pleased with this purchase.", "id": "289913"}

I like that it shuts off cooling when the environment reaches the selected temp, although that may be a widely offered feature (?).

They sit next to each other on my counter top, 4-5 inches spaced off the wall, 2-3 inches apart from each other. The temperature in my house is kept typically between 78-82 degrees during the summer. NOTE this is ABOVE the ambient temperature requirements for the units to efficiently cool to the lower end (46-52). This is not an issue for me, though it should be clearly stated. As I write this review, the one cabinet is going back and fourth between 58-59 and the other is holding steady at 53. The 53 is warmer then I'd like but again my house is really warm. Opening the door, yes the temperature does go up quite a bit. These are small so its expected however, they do come back down to temperature pretty quick These cabinets are close to my fridge and although you can hear the fans quite well when near them, it's not louder then when my fridge compressor comes on.

Like all thermoelectric products it creates quite a bit of heat in the back, so keep it at least 3 inches from corner walls for optimum efficiency (side and back).

{"review": "I bought this wine cooler to put under the bar top in my winery tasting room. It has functioned well and is sleek and compact and completely silent. BUT...perhaps it is my fault but I did not notice before I bought it that the COLDEST setting it goes to, which I now understand is a function of the non-mechanical way it creates cooling, is 54 degrees! While this is adequate for dry white wines, it won't we cold enough for sweeter wines and certainly not cold enough for late harvest, dessert type wines that should be chilled to 45 degrees or so. ALSO... be aware of two limitations caused by the very compact design: FIRST, heavier weight (read that, more expensive) bottles with even a slightly larger diameter than standard Bordeaux bottles WILL NOT FIT in the wire racks. There is a reason why it will fit eighteen bottles in such a small space: the tolerances are VERY TIGHT and sized for grocery-store standard cabs, etc. SECOND, opened bottles with the cork reinserted part way or with a vacuum cork WILL NOT FIT in the cooler because the depth of the cooler brings the glass door right up to the foil of the unopened bottles. As I said, it's a nice cooler....BUT", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I just recieved the wine cooler. I have to say its pretty amazing. The build is top notch. Very comparable to my friends Vinotemp but hundreds $$$ less. The Review: The package arrived with good protection as seen in the photos below. The used double boxes with a layer of foam in between the boxes. Then another round of padding is added to the cooler edges. The cooler was delivered in perfect condition. After un-boxing, I did a quick check around the cooler to check out the quality. It is very nice. The brushed stainless matches my Samsung refrigerator and seems of good quality. The door hinges are solid and have no play. The window is double pane and the seal wraps around the frame with continuity which should help with the efficiency. Looking inside of the cooler. There are chrome racks that slide in and out easily. The door handle and screws are inside. The door handle is the only part of the unit that needs assembly. It is very easy, you just lift part of the rubber seal to expose the screw holes, put the screws through, and screw down the handle via the 2 stainless steel screws. Its a clean and easy to use setup. There is and \"up\" and \"down\" temperature control buttons and one light button, which controls the LED internal light. Once plugged in, the thermostatic showed 74 degrees. I started my chronograph to clock the amount of time it took to drop down to 54 degrees (the lowest temperature setting). The internal LED lighting is really cool looking. The blue light reflects off the chrome racks to appear like there are hundreds of little blue sparkly lights. The photo doesn't do justice. It is a nice look at night and should impress the friends if they come over for a drink. The cooler took approximately 20 minutes to drop the internal temperature from 74 degrees down to 54 degrees. I think that's pretty fast for a coolant-less thermoelectric cooler. I also go my analog thermometer to gauge the accuracy of the built-in digital thermostat, its dead on accurate. One thing to note is the that since its not a wine \"refrigerator\" you can only get down to 54 degrees, which is perfect for both red and white wines. However, you cannot effectively store other beverages like beer and soda because they need much lower temps unless you like semi-warm beers. On the other hand, you save money on the unit (thermoelectrics are much cheaper than refrigerators) and you save money on power consumption. The noise...5 stars! Not much noise at all. There is a slight humming. Maybe slightly louder than the electrical humming of an alarm clock. The capacity is 18 regular sized bottles. It will hold much less if you have over-sized bottles or champagne bottles to store inside. After playing around with the wine bottle configuration. I noticed that the top shelf is the only shelf that can fit over-sized (extra girth) bottles. You can fit 3 girthy bottles on the top shelf. The rest of the shelves only fit normal sized bottles. * also notice in the photo below, my cooler actually got down to 53 degrees. For the full review with photos [...] [...]", "id": "289913"}

I settled on the New Air model because it seemed to me it fulfilled all my requirements: good quality, right size, good looking and great value. I'm very impressed with this item. It arrived in one day, and came well packaged - no chances for dents or scratches. The handle was easy to install and does not compromise the door seal. The unit is light enough that one person can handle it. I followed the instructions and let it rest two hours before plugging it in. It cooled down to my desired temperature (62') in less than an hour. It's pretty quiet but the fans are on all the time so there is a slight buzz coming from it, but nothing annoying though. I like the fact that the thermostat can be easily accessed and that the light can be turned on and off at will as the controls for both are placed on the front of the unit.

{"review": "Let me first say that buying products on Amazon is usually great. In this case, however, I bought this wine fridge on Amazon Marketplace, which was sold by an outside seller named \"Air & Water Inc\". I bought this as a present for my parents in June 2012 (6 months ago), and they routinely had trouble with the product. Though it cools properly and the unit looks nice, the fridge makes noise everytime it's cooling. To the point it's annoying, and my parents won't keep it in their kitchen. I asked for a return from \"Air & Water Inc\" and was told I have to ship the fridge back to them (in Santa Ana, CA) and they'll ship back to me fixed -- but I have to pay shipping both ways. That's not good customer service, considering the product NEVER WORKED PROPERLY IN THE FIRST PLACE! I should have read the fine print (ie, that I have to pay shipping costs), because paying to ship a 34 pound fridge isn't cheap! They have a special rate to ship the product back to me for $10 (via Fedex), but it's too expensive to ship the faulty product to Air & Water to fix, so the company knows they'll get few returns in situations like mine (where it's prohibitively expensive to have ship your products to get fixed. My advice is to order this product through Amazon (Amazon Prime) and NOT \"Air & Water Inc\". Amazon will let you return the product if you have issues. And they won't charge you to ship back the faulty product you were given (like Air & Water Inc has done to me).

{"review": "For those of you who are conflicted and confused about what the distinctions are between a \"wine cooler\" and a \"wine cellar\", let this reviewer be clear about this Danby model: it is a mini refrigerator that has a tinted glass door instead of a solid door, and a black interior instead of a white interior, and has wire racks spaced to accommodate wine bottles instead of groceries. Other than those styling differences I am sure that it is made on the same factory line as Danby's mini fridges, has the same mechanical guts and thermostat, and is otherwise not in any way made especially for wine. It's a mini refrigerator styled to make you feel good about putting your wine in a \"wine cooler\" instead of a refrigerator. That is not a bad thing, in itself. But don't expect too much beyond that. Many people feel that the ideal temp for wine storage is about 55F. I was able to get the Danby to maintain a roughly stable temp of 55F with the temp dial turned to barely a fraction above OFF. With the thermostat turned higher (stronger) it is likely that the unit would achieve a temp much like a regular fridge, of about 40F. Several reviewers have noted that their units ran \"cold\". One thing I did notice, using a digital thermometer, was that there was about a six to seven (6-7) degree difference between the top rack and bottom rack of the unit. If it was 55F on the top rack then it was 49F or even a little colder on the lower racks. Someone thinking about paying a premium price for a cooler model advertised as \"dual zone\" might want to contemplate this. It may be that wine coolers of this type are \"dual zone\" by nature, no need to stress and worry and pay extra for this \"feature\". Some people have expressed the opinion that leaving wine in a unit like this for extended periods will dry out the corks. I left a digital humidity meter inside for a day, and noted that the humidity level was 60%. Hardly desert like. The unit seems well built and solid. It certainly weighs enough at about 70 pounds. It is slightly noisy, as others have noted, making a noticeable whine when cycling for a few minutes every so often. But I tend to think that the sound levels are more a product of a unit like this being placed in living rooms or dens, where this kind of noise is unusual and calls attention to itself, more than it is due to the system being more noisy than average. It does in fact hold 36 standard sized bottles. Adding one broad shouldered bottle per row didn't cause any problem. But if your whole assortment of wine is all broad shouldered bottles then you might wind up with only four bottles per row rather than five. But standard 750ml bottles were no problem. I am basically happy with my Danby wine cooler for what it is: an inexpensive unit that is mostly for convenient wine storage close to the dining table, at a temp that is approximately the right temp for storage, that protects wine from big temp swings and excessive heat. It's not a system for long term aging or preservation. For the price, about $240.00 from Amazon with free shipping for Prime members at the time of this review, it is certainly the cheapest unit of this type on offer. It seems to be a great bargain, even with the features that it lacks. It does not, for example, have a digital temp readout, or the ability to maintain warmer temps up to about 60F, or humidity control, and although the racks are removable they are not slide out trays, you have to pull each bottle out to see what it is. For the money I am a happy buyer. At higher prices one should be more critical, and might think harder about the system's characteristics before buying.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "This is a good wine fridge but note that you may not get 36 bottles in there as high shouldered bottles will only fit four to a shelf.

(no touch pads, or 'digital' controls to break). As for noise the compressor is very quiet - not sure i would put in a bedroom but fine for the living room. The blue LEDs can be turned off but generally look nice. After some fiddling and setting the manual temp control almost to the lowest (warmest) level I was able to get the temp to 52F which is where I like my wine.

{"review": "This is our 2nd Danby wine cooler; our original slightly smaller model is 9 yrs old and still runs like a top. This slightly larger capacity unit was installed in new floor standing cabinetry, (bar like), with some air space on both sides and top of unit. In the couple months post installation, it performs well, if not in the same league with more pricey dedicated thermoelectric wine coolers. -Pros: runs fairly quietly, and excellent QPR, even if it goes kaboom in a few years. Holds temp... -Cons: runs a bit too cold even at lowest 'barely on' setting. That running very cold kept it from 5 stars. -Nits: I could do without the always on blue ray lighting. Won't hold that '36 blt' number of any kind of wine bottle, but neither will the thousand dollar units from the wine outlets. The blt capacity is always overstated, in my experience. Will be interesting to see how this new unit holds up compared to our 9 yr old model, as many items 'today' are not made as well as they were a decade ago, imo.

{"review": "I picked this cooler because of price, capacity, and preponderance of favorable reviews. I was somewhat familiar with the Danby brand, but this was my first purchase of a Danby product. The unfavorable reviews were based on noise and temperature. You can change how the door opens, but I was happy with it the way it came. After you remove the packing materials, all you have to do is to plug it in and add the wine bottles. Regarding noise, to somebody living in a New York City apartment it is whisper-quiet-- far quieter than the nearby top-of-the line new refrigerator. I keep reopening it to feel the bottles to make sure it is running. As for temperature, you have to experiment with the non- digital control -- we bought it for wine storage, not wine refrigeration, and it works fine to cool not chill, once you experiment with the control. The bottom shelf is shallower that the others, to make room for the compressor, so the bottles on it go sideways. I have 32 750 ml bottles and three 350 ml bottles in it, and could squeeze in another bottle if I wanted to. The bottom shelves seem to be cooler than the top shelves, so I put a few whites on the bottom. On balance, I'd have to say that it is an excellent value. All it has to do to make me a fan, is to keep running. By the way, you get two more months on the warranty for registering online. However, I sprang for the two-year warranty.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "I've had this wine cooler for a couple of months now. Overall, it does the job it was intended to do. I keep both red and white wines in it, by keeping the temperature at 56F. That's borderline low for red, and borderline high for white, so it's not perfect. But, I was prepared for that because it is a single-zone cooler after all. My wife and I don't drink that much wine (2 bottles a week, more if we have guests over). I had planned to purchase a second unit, so that we'd have one for red wines, and a separate one for white wines. But, we're happy with the borderline temperature setting so far. The spacing of the metal racks is barely sufficient for regular-size bottles. We have problems with any wine bottles that are wider or taller than usual, even if they are 750 ml. We end up having to use the space with no racks in order to stack wide bottles directly on top of each other. We can't place any of the longer-necked bottles (some white wines are like that). My biggest complaint is the fan. It's a lot noisier than I thought, and it seems to cycle on and off very frequently (much noisier and more frequent than our ref). When the house is quiet, it can be disturbing. I have no idea if this cycling will reduce the lifespan of the product.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "After doing ALOT of research on wine coolers in all price ranges, I finally chose this one because of the ability to store opened wines upright. This was one of the few in all price ranges that had this feature and its a GREAT feature, and its eye appealing. I have had the cooler for a week now. I drink mostly white, some red wines, and I buy a variety of wines, mostly from grocery stores and some wine places, so the bottles are always different and different sizes. I have 12 different bottles of wine in there right now and they all fit just fine. Obviously you can't get a supersized bottle of wine in there. As for the sound everyone complains about, it is not bad, I have it in my kitchen and when it runs (it doesn't run all the time) I can hear it, but its not any different than the fridge running. I guess keep that in mind if you want it in your living room. The only downfall is the display light, it looks GREAT when its on, but it has a default shut off after 10 minutes. It would be nice if it could stay on longer than that, and its not something you can adjust. The convexity of the front glass and the digital read is very classy and I absolutely love this unit! I keep mine at 50* for my white wines, and it works great. I put this unit underneath a counter, but you have to make sure you have ample room on each side and above for it to vent. It does put out some heat when it runs. I have 4-5 inches on each side, including in the back. I would not recommend for a tightly enclosed space.", "id": "289913"}

The unit set-up quickly and over the the week has performed well. One small negative is that the controls have a lock out feature that also works on the interior light. You have to push both temperature control switches for three secounds and then push the light switch to get the light to come on. A very small bother. The size of the unit didn't lend itself to a counter top and it can't be mounted inside a cabinet due to the 5\" of clear space required around the unit for air circulation. I ended up placing in the pantry. It does put out more heat than you would expect but doesn't seem to be an issue. I haven't noticed the noise mentioned in other reviews but again it is in a pantry. Overall after a week we are very satisfied with the unit and the only things that keeps it from getting 5 stars is the light switch and the location restrictions (needing 5\" of space around unit).", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "My wife and I received this item as a wedding gift and, although we are generally satisfied with some aspects of the cooler (appearance, capacity and size, and convenience) the unit itself does not maintain a stable temperature on its own (a \"must have\" for delicate wines and the reason we wanted a wine fridge in the first place). The unit, as I was told by a representative at the fridge's manufacturer, is an ambient room temperature-dependant machine and is only capable of cooling between 20-25 degrees of the room's temperature. What this means is that wide swings in temp (such as in an non air conditioned apartment) will result in equally dramatic swings in the fridge's internal temperature. Additionally, on a hot summer's day, I have seen the temperature swing as high as 25 degrees above the unit's set temperature. If high levels of temperature control and stability are more important to you than slick looks, small external unit size, and the convenience of being able to have wine out of your regular refrigerators, perhaps another unit would best suit your needs", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "Initially, I loved this product and would have given it 5 stars. It does everything that I wanted and I particularly like the ability to store opened bottles standing up. Unfortunately, it is loud. I bought it to install inside a wooden bar, which apparently amplifies the noise. At night, I can hear it two rooms away. Taking it out of the bar makes it usable, but still VERY noticeable in the same room. It's a potentially great product marred by one glaring design flaw.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "My product arrived, undamaged, no dents in the box, no broken glass, and absolutely perfect. I first tried to squeeze this into a small corner which I thought would be perfect in the kitchen...wrong! The manual states to give it 5\" of breathing room around the sides and boy are they not joking. Your cooler will not be able to go sub 61 degrees if you don't give it breathing room. Upon moving it to another place, the temperature immediately started dropping and my fridge thermometer was reporting the same. The fan is not loud as other reviewers state. The noise it produces is half (probably more) of what a refrigerator generates. I have it fairly close to my couch and unless your place is whisper quiet, you will not notice it. It will be like white noise in the background. The heat from my radiator is louder than the whisper this produces. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something tiny yet holds a good amount of wine. 03-12-2014 Edit: Now that I've had the wine cooler for a couple of months and have it fully stocked, I have noticed the temperature gauge being off as previous reviewers state. In order to have my cooler be at a constant 55 degrees, I need to set it to 48. I would highly recommend purchasing a refrigerator thermometer to hang off of one of the shelves.

The energy saving capabilities keeps this at a four star, instead of a three.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "The Avanti is a replacement cooler. So far so good. It seems to maintain temps very well and it's an attractive unit. The temperature control and display are on the front and easy to read. I wouldn't recommend this cooler if noise is an issue. It's a bit noisey when the motor is running. For me that's not a problem bacause it's in a side room. Otherwise I'm pleased with this cooler.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I am aware of the number of negative reviews on this and other brands of the same product so the reading was carefully done and it came down to this one after about three days of examining various remarks on different sites. It's not easy picking one because these wine refrigs come across as sensitive and not really durable or built for longevity. Once I subtracted the extraordinary negative reviews for the different brands, which must come from competitors, and try to estimate how many dumbazzes do not treat the appliance properly during set up, then I got the percentage of reviews I needed to determine who prevailed. Cost, design, and features then completed the selection process. Wine Enthusiast, according to some, cannot be trusted for customer service or quality. Some of the same reasoning, however, can be found for other brands. So, I chose this one based on the design (tall and slim) so it would fit between a basement bookshelf and table, noise (it is very quiet), attractiveness in a living area (black metal with tempered glass front surrounded by stainless steel trim), and cost for the goods received (18 bottles 750ml each storage for Amazon's price proved highly desirable). Future buyers caveat: DO NOT do anything with it until you read the small manual included which you will find inside the unit. Too many people do not understand the need for the air temp parameters in the room where it will be located, allowing the unit to reach room temp before plugging it in, keeping it upright for at least 2 hours before plugging it in (I let mine sit overnight just to be sure any lubricants in it settled properly), and positioning it where it will get the best ventilation around the the sides and back. This is not a unit to be built in under a cabinet and you have to keep it away from air conditioners or heat sources. There is a statement in the manual that reads \"In order to reach the lowest temperature (lower zone), the best ambient temperature will be around 60-65 F\". Mine is in the finished basement area where the temp is typically 66 in the winter and might get to 70 in the summer on very hot days. When you plug it in you should set the temps desired and wait for the two sections to reach those temps before loading in case there might be some type of malfunction. I left mine overnight because after 3 hours it was still adjusting and it was time for lights out. The next morning the two sections were correctly reading my settings. If you have difficulty remembering, recall that HEAT RISES so the top part should hold the reds and be set warmer and the lower will have your whites which will be 8-10 degrees cooler. The design provides different high and low for each section. I then loaded the wine bottles that had been in the refrigerator (where the interior temp was 40deg) and both sections of the wine refrig dropped a few degrees. About four hours later the sections were reading back to the settings. Remember that these little starter coolers are not for fine expensive wines but are only to allow you to provide your bottle at the proper drinking temperature when the meal is ready...in addition to freeing up all of your refrigerator space if you like to have 10 to 18 bottles on hand of different varietals. So, after 48 hours I can tell you that everything is mellow and the first bottle from the Slimline was at just the right temp for the Sunday meal. No more fumbling through a lot of bottles on a fridge shelf, estimating when to take the bottle out and leaving it on the table with the hope that it will be at the right temp when the serving plates are passed around. If there are electronic problems in the near future, i.e. up to one year, I will return and update. WARNING: I thought I would look into Wine Enthusiast's 2,3 and 5 year extended warranty plans considering the problems that these types of appliances have. When I clicked on each one all three stated that due to \"overwhelming demand\" the plan was no longer available. Something smells about that notice. How does a company \"run out\" of extended warranties unless they already know that the consumer bought a lemon? At best, they should not have even offered such a plan on their site if they could not deliver. This was something I was unaware of until after delivery and I had to register the unit with the company.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I spent far too many hours researching wine fridges before settling on this one. That said, calling it a \"fridge\" is a bit inaccurate. These \"budget\" units use fans and some fancy electrical stuff to create the not-so-low temperatures your wines need for proper storage. They use less electricity than a refrigerator, they are very quiet, and they don't get down to freezing temperatures. Unlike many, however, this cooler DOES get cold enough for proper white wine storage (I have it set to 46 degrees). The dual zone function is awesome (I have my reds at 55). You get nine bottles per zone. It's very attractive, 100% silent (folks saying theirs isn't have defective units and should return), and works great. If you're on the fence, make the leap; this has taken our wine consumption to new levels (quality, not quantity). My only complaint would be that the wire racks are a bit flimsy and the storage space is very tight, which means you won't be able to fit 18 bottles if you have anything even a little bit oversized (champagne). Save your time and rely on my research. This is an outstanding product. UPDATE: Dropped down to 3-stars. After a few weeks of use (no changes in the product's environment), the unit is unable to hold the correct temperature for reds. It's still rocking for my whites, but it's too cold for reds (set to 55, but it won't go above 51). Could be worse, but worth mentioning. UPDATE #2: Back to four. We moved to a slightly cooler climate and this thing is able to hold temps like a dream. If you buy knowing what you're getting (a passive cooler that has limitations bound by physics), you won't be happier.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "It works well but, as others have mentioned, it is not silent. It seems to have become louder after a week or so.

Will not buy this brand again.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "The \"silent\" and \"ultra quiet\" claims from Wine Enthusiast are completely bogus. I bought one of these to fit in a smallspace in our living room, but can't use it there because the 'silent' fridge is so loud that it would be very distracting when we are watching TV - it's that loud. Now I have it inside a closet (with the closet door closed) over 50 feet away from the living room - and yet we can still occasionally hear it. BTW, I also contacted WineEnthusiast customer support online, and recieved an email from them promissing a response within 2 working days. That was several weeks ago, and despite several follow-up emails to them I got no response at all (and yes, I checked my spam filters). I finally contacted them by phone and asked why I had recieved no response - no explanation given, and no apology for being utterly unresponsive. Silent my foot... don't believe the hype.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I bought this as a replacement for a Haier unit that broke after about 12 months. Overall it is highly recommended for the price and size. I don't find it that loud at all. It has a sleek look and the dual temperature control is intuitive and easy to adjust. It's a little on the small side, obviously, as it only holds about 18 bottles. But you knew that, since, you know, it's in the title of the product. I did have an issue with the leveling legs upon installation. The front leg wasn't adjustable so the unit was wobbly. Have to give props to Wine Enthusiast here - I contacted their customer support and within 2 days they sent me a replacement part free of charge the fixed the issue. So, for under $250 or so, you can't do much better than this unit.", "id": "289913"}

{"review": "i have had it for about a year and it is holding up great. the summer was very trying for this little fridge as we do not keep the AC on during the day when we are not home and it gets very hot (high 80s and 90s easily). when the ambient temp is so hot, the fridge works constantly but cant keep up - which was expected. in the instructions (yes, i read those cover to cover :)) they state that it cannot keep temps lower then 30 degrees below the ambient, i.e. if its 90 in the room the coolest the fridge can theoretically get is 60. anyways, i am overall happy with it. the one down side is that the fan is VERY loud. it is in a 25x14 area, i sit about 10' from it, the tv is on and it is still noticeable if you pay attention. it will not drown out the tv but it will be in the background. i clean it regularly, so thats not a problem. i guess its just the way it is... i can tolerate it but i live on a very busy street, in nyc metro, so i am used to a lot of background noise. in fact, i can't even fall sleep if its too quiet :D", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I purchased this unit because it was cosmetically a match to my Wine Enthusiast 28 bottle fridge. It was also $100 cheaper, but the NewAir unit ran all the time! I emailed NewAir about my issue and they said it was normal. However, my Wine Enthusiast fridge runs for a couple of minutes and then it shuts off. So I purchased a KillAWatt and tested both units for a 24 hour period. Both were set to the same temperature and tested within 48 hours (so no season changes). Here are the averages for each unit: NewAir - 3.22kwh Wine Enthusiast - 1.33kwh As you can see the NewAir unit draws 2.4x more energy to keep my wine at temperature. If I would have know that I would have paid more and got another Wine Enthusiast cooler.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I've owned this unit for roughly 1 month now and have been relatively satisfied. Before I purchased the unit, I had read a number of reviews of this unit and several other units from other manufacturers and had decided that this one would be best suited to meet my needs within my price range. With respect to initial research, I obtained most of my information either from other customer reviews or by calling customer service directly. Customer service was extremely helpful in detailing the unit's internal dimensions and technical characteristics, as well as explaining the Repair Master warranty in more detail. They were also kind enough to send me a PDF version of the user manual so that I could review it before purchase (since the link on the website was broken). As previous reviewers have noted, the shelves are closely spaced, so larger bottles with wider diameters or that are taller (internal depth of roughly 13\") may not fit. I purchased the unit expressly to house champagne. What I ended up doing was removing the bottom 3 shelves so that I could store the champagne upright without damaging the labeling. In doing so, I can store 8 or 9 champagne bottles in the bottom with ease, with the upper racks still available to store red wine or beer as the mood strikes me. Temperature regulation seems fairly constant. I have not done an independent check of the temperature sensor. As the manual notes, the unit should be allowed to stand for 2 hrs after shipment/moving to reduce the possibility of a malfunction of the cooling system. I have already moved once and was surprised to discover just how true this statement was. Prior to the move, I had set the cooler to 54. I then unplugged the unit and moved it to my new place (which took me 30 minutes to an hr). I immediately plugged it back in to make sure the bottles didn't heat dramatically. The unit then settled to 56. I'm assuming the reason is exactly what was described in the manual. After a period of 2 days, it then returned to 54 (without me ever touching the temperature controls). The manual does tell you to transport the unit upright when moving (I had it on its side since that was the only way it was fitting in my car). Just something to keep in mind. In terms of the time it takes to get down to the desired temperature, it will definitely take a while initially. When I first received the unit, I set it to 54 with the cooler empty just to make sure it would work. That took a matter of a few hours. I then filled it with 8 bottles of champagne and red wine. With an ambient temperature (and presumably bottle temperature) of about 78, it took somewhere around a day and a half to get back down to 54. Once the unit gets down to 54, opening the door to remove a bottle seems to cause it to shoot up to as high as 60, before it cools itself back down. The door handle does have to be attached by you, the user. This isn't stated in the manual. However, I was prepared for this from reading other reviews. I did receive both screws and had a good idea of where to look beneath the magnetic strip for the screwholes. The wire racks are metal and removable. Plastic clips on the interior of the unit prevent them from sliding out too far. It may take a little force to bend the clips slightly to create enough clearance to remove the metal racks from the unit. Not something I would advise doing often, considering they are plastic, but they seem durable enough to withstand such action every now and then. There is a little blue light on the interior at the top of the unit which can be controlled by a light switch on the front of the unit. The manual states turning it on can cause temperature variations within the unit. I just leave mine off and have never verified just how much it causes the temperature to vary. There is a filter in the back of the unit that fits loosely in a slot. I don't believe I ever saw any mention of it in the manual. The only reason I bring it up is because it can fall out rather easily if the unit is flipped on its side (which I did during moving). With regards to noise, the unit is not silent, but it is not loud either. When I first turned it on, the hum surprised me, but I quickly got used to it and don't even notice it now. As for maintenance, I have yet to clean the water reservoir. From reading the manual, it doesn't sound hard. Additionally, the troubleshooting section of the manual does detail a list of common problems the unit may experience. I had to call customer service to get some clarification as to which of those problems were covered by warranty and what the most common issues were, as well as how they could be addressed. They were very up front and I was very comfortable with the apparent relative ease of maintenance prior to making my purchase. All in all, even though it has only been a month, I have been quite satisfied with my purchase. I knew exactly what I was getting into and the unit has most definitely delivered. Everything still works just fine and I have no complaints.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "So we bought this wine cooler on reading the specs in the description, and not by finding the manual online and reading it, which was a big mistake. The description says \"This wine refrigerator has a black cabinet with stainless steel trim and chrome plated racks. It's sure to complement just about any room in your home.\" Yeah, as long as your room temperature is between 77-80 degrees (stated in the manual). Our experience in regular room or a little cooler (60-65) -- it is winter here in New England, the cooler just got colder and colder -- as low as 40 degrees -- no matter what the setting was. We pretty much have decided to keep it though, and put it on a 48/0n/Off settings timer -- like 30 minutes to 1 hour on and 90 minutes to 2 hours off.

{"review": "Let me start by saying Amazon Customer Service has been terrific through the drama of this purchase. I had to pack up and return two coolers before sticking with the one I have now. The first one arrived damaged. The back of it looked like someone drove a forklift into it. I sent it back and a replacement arrived the first business day following my call. The second one arrived more damaged than the first and looked \"used.\" The back was all banged up and scratched and there were scratches on the front near where the buttons are. Amazon offered a discount if I kept the item, but it couldn't hold a temperature. It was constantly up and down. They allowed me to use the cooler (it was still better than the heat from a heatwave) until another replacement came. The second replacement arrived, but it had a sharp dent in the side because of improper packaging. The 3rd one works well, so far, despite the dent. The discount made that dent hurt less, and I won't have to package up a third cooler to send back. I'm not sure where the damage occurred (manufacturer/shipper/delivery service), but the item needs significantly better packaging because much of this could have been avoided. All this aside. this is a good value for an \"entry level\" cooler. I picked this cooler because I did extensive research and it got the best reviews of all of the comparable coolers in this price range over a number of websites. I also appreciate that most coolers under $800 aren't the best manufactured products, so I bought a 4-year extended warranty. The cooler looks nice, is quiet but not silent (my refrigerator is much louder) and so far is holding steady at 55 degrees even when the ambient temperature in my condo is over 80. It holds 24 bottles well, but would hold 28 if all of my bottles were the standard size. The shelves are aluminum, so they feel a bit flimsy, but they serve their purpose.

{"review": "Bought this to cool our wines and store them long term. Although, that is naive at this point. I know this cooler will break at some point within the next 10 years. It has spinning fans, and with any moving part, they can always break. Keep that in mind. I left the Styrofoam in the door to add extra shielding from light and another layer of insulation. Works well. It has a certain level of hum that is noticeable when you're listening for it. I've notice the noise level is greatest at the lowest temp setting and less at around 60F. When we got our first cooler it was clearly defective because it would blow and blow and do nothing but bring our wines to room temp. Sent it back and the replacement we have now is in perfect working order. If you get one of those take it back or return it to Amazon and get a replacement. We had to pay for shipment, which sucked since it was their product that broke. Bottom line: It looks great for inside the home and does keep your wines at whatever temp, 54F & >, you want. It's life span will be short, 5-10 years, hold normal sized bottles unless you remove a tray to accommodate larger irregular shaped bottles of wine, has some ambient noise unless you set it at a higher temp setting in which the noise will decrease. Unless you have a few thousand to drop on a pro wine cellar or have a larger collection of wines this will work for you. My guess is that you will eventually be looking for a larger one once you have started a collection but it will do what it says, unless you get a defective one like me. 2 stars for quality: got a defective unit 3 stars for functionality: works but a little noisy in the optimal temp range 4 stars for appearance: looks like a high end unit and goes well with other like items in the house", "id": "289913"}

The blue light is a soothing to look at in the darkness of my kitchen. The temperature is consistent, and so far my wine loves their new home.

{"review": "I was hesitant to order this unit given many of the negative reviews, however I decided to pull the trigger as I wanted a wine cooler without paying $1k plus. I was pleasantly surprised that the unit came as described and all of my standard sized bottles of wine fit perfectly in the shelves. Per some previous customer comments, the shelves slide out for easy access. If you complain about it being hard to get wine bottles in and out, then you're not sliding the shelves out. Note the instructions tell you to leave the unit unplugged for 2 hours after unboxing it to allow it to adjust to your indoor temp. I did follow this recommendation. I then plugged up the unit and adjusted temp settings. Both zones were are my desired temp by the next morning. The one Con I would give this product is the packaging is not the best. It's packed in a box with very thin Styrofoam. I could see how a FedEx or UPS mishap could easily damage the product, however mine came in perfect condition.", "id": "289913"}
{"review": "I've used a few different types of humidifiers over the past couple years, and my favorite so far has been a warm mist/vapor humidifier, like the simple boiling water kind you get from Vicks. Those humidifiers put out a lot of humidity, they're easy to refill, and they don't make everything in a room get a white powdery coating. Ultrasonic/cool mist humidifiers often make a white powder coating appear on some surfaces if you have hard water (like I do), but they are quieter (no boiling or fans), they don't raise the ambient temperature, and the mist can be directed via the vent at the top. They also don't use filters, so there is no maintenance or extras you have to purchase other than a simple weekly (at least) cleaning. This humidifier has simple controls (on/off switch on the back, mist level knob on the front), and a neat little port on the top that you can direct in two different spots. I usually just keep both vents pointed in the same direction. Refilling is easy; just grab the translucent top part, turn it upside-down, unscrew the drain plug, and fill in a standard-size sink. If I set the level to low/medium, I can use the humidifier up to a full day or so before a refill. If set on high, it only seems to last about 8-10 hours. Also, the humidifier shuts itself off if it senses no more water. RECOMMENDATION: If you need a simple cool mist humidifier, like one for a baby's room, this is a great option--especially if you only need to have it on for a small part of the day (otherwise you'll be refilling it a lot). TIP FOR LONGEVITY: Make sure you follow the included cleaning instructions, especially with regard to cleaning mineral buildup every week. If you don't this humidifier will probably only last a year or less (especially if you have hard water at your home, and don't use distilled water to humidify the air). If you clean it weekly, expect years of use.", "id": "267555011"}
{"review": "Pros: I love that I can turn it on high and get a room humidified fast. (When needed, I can leave it on high for an our or two to get one kid's room humidified for bed time and then move it to another kid's room). I love that I can turn it on low and leave it for two days running without touching it. And that there are settings in between high and low. I love that it doesn't have a filter to deal with and to purchase regularly! I have used a filtered ultrasonic humidifier in the past, and besides having the filter to deal with, I disliked that it was so slow to humidify a room. After a day it was fine, but when a child is sick at night, you want the humidifier to work immediately. Cons: The plastic tank is very thin. Others have complained about it leaking after a while. I had mine for half of a season and then it was knocked over from a high shelf and broke. That is understandable from how hard it fell, but I worry about how long my new one will last. The tank is also a little awkward to fill. It would be nice if it had a flat top or a better handle. But it's not bad. I didn't clean my first one as often as I should have, and then I did have a hard time keeping it clean. The second time around, I rinse it all every time I change the water (or sometimes sooner if I have it on low), and rinse with vinegar once a week as it explains in the instructions, and have had no problems keeping it clean. The switch is easy to move from low to high, and I have had the problem of a child turning it up to high at night without me knowing, and things being a little too humid the next morning. I spent a lot of time looking at humidifiers, and I am very happy with this purchase for the reasons mentioned and with the relatively low price.
