{"review": "I read some of the negative reviews and gave this a try anyway. Fearing that I may end up getting a used repackaged product (as mentioned in some of the negative reviews) I made sure to pick up a TDS* water meter/tester as well. Not only to make sure I got a new filter from this seller, but also so I can test the various liquids used around my home. As I'd mentioned in my review for the TDS* water meter/tester, my tap water is hard so I used the baseline measurement (PPM's) of a bottle of Poland Spring water. My main concern about this filter or my refrigerator water line in general, was that it wasn't going to make too much of a difference drinking water from the tap versus one that came out of this filter. After my baseline measurements, my concerns were put at ease. Below are results from my tests: (measurements in PPM) 0-50 = Ideal drinking water 50-100 = Carbon filtered water 100-200 = Hard water 200-300 = Marginally acceptable 200-400 = Average tap water 400+ Very high TDS contaminant level --My household baseline-- Bottle of Poland Spring = 18 Tap Water = 281 Gatorade = 260 5 month old filter from my refrigerator water line = 240 New filter from my refrigerator water line = 200 Melted ice (4 hours) = 293 So what did I learn from this... My tap water isn't too bad, this particular filter can probably go another month or two, and I really need to clean my ice maker. The good news is that this filter removed 80+PPM's of TDS* from my tap. *TDS* - Total Dissolved Solids are the total amount of mobile charged ions, including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in a given volume of water.", "id": 13900821}

To my extreme surprise, the water filters remove nothing from the water, the contaminent levels are equal with the tap water in each of my two houses!!! I ran gallons of water through the filters and the readings never went down. So I called GE, customer service informed me there was a small chance I could have received 2 defective filters, and I should try to return them to Amazon. I tested the HM water meter on bottled water that is supposed to be very pure, and it was. Arrowhead water is at a \"marginally safe tap water\" level. My neighbor's reverse osmosis worked well.

I plan on retesting many times, with a new filter on, under different various conditions, etc. But the preliminary news is that this GE filter barely does anything. The testing does not tell you what the contaminants are... it could be that the filter is removing harmful ones, yet returning charcoal from the filtering process? Or it could be the refrigerator is channeling the water around the filter instead of through it? A lot of thing could be going on... but one thing that wont be going on is me drinking much of the water coming out of the GE filter anymore! Time to find a MUCH better solution to the dirty water problem. Buyer beware. Get your own TDS tester to find out how things are working at your house. UPDATE: I've updated to three stars out of respect for a poster that explained that the filter is actually doing its job. I'm certainly no expert on this topic, but have respect for people that are.

Time to find a MUCH better solution to the dirty water problem. Buyer beware. Get your own TDS tester to find out how things are working at your house. UPDATE: I've updated to three stars out of respect for a poster that explained that the filter is actually doing its job. I'm certainly no expert on this topic, but have respect for people that are.

{"review": "I've ordered and reordered this product many times from Amazon and the price is great online and the product is fully sealed and shipping has been great, etc. Both the GE brand and other brands fail to work more than a few weeks before they clog and water starts coming out very slowly. But I keep buying them because I want clean and safe water. Well, today I just got a TDS-3 Water Quality Meter (from Amazon) to test the quality of my water. It turns out that these GE filters are barely removing any particles from the tap water! Here are my results: Here are my results: Tap Water: 86 GE Smartwater filter on my refrigerator: 75 Instant hot water, being filtered first using a hot water filter: 85 Poland Springs bottled water: 25 Distilled water: 0 (ZERO!) The only question is: WHAT DO I DO NOW THAT I KNOW THIS? - Stop filtering my water? - Only drink Poland Springs? I plan on retesting many times, with a new filter on, under different various conditions, etc. But the preliminary news is that this GE filter barely does anything.

{"review": "This filter was a snap to install, and once I did my water pressure from the dispenser was back to normal. If you've got a refrigerator that uses one of these filters and the water's been coming out slow then it's probably time for a new filter. One word of advice: use a big water pitcher for the first use of the dispenser after the filter change - the pressure has to readjust and it will spit out a few huge blasts of water that will overwhelm your normal water glass. After the couple of big blasts though, you get constant good pressure, better than you remembered was even possible after the gradual slow down with your old filter.", "id": 1294452011}

{"review": "This filter is rated at 750 gallons capacity. If the consumer uses one gallon of water per day in the form of water from the refrigerator dispenser and ice from the ice dispenser, the filter will last 750 days; i.e., just over TWO years. In general, there is no reason to replace the filter yearly, unless you have a really yuccky water source. In a small household of two adults, the filter should last considerably longer than two years. Furthermore, with the addition of a filtered water dispenser at the sink (such as a GE undercounter unit), the refrigerator filter would be functional for a few years.

{"review": "Lots of reviews on this site refer to the confusion regarding this replacement filter (UKF8001), so here are my observations on two matters: 1.) Which filter are we getting (750 Gallons vs 200 Gallons, etc) when we buy UKF8001? 2.) How frequently should we change it? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gallon Capacity Rating ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Like everyone else, my box lists two different capacities (750 Gallon Rating & 200 Gallon Rating) * Underneath each gallon rating it says the number of contaminents reduced (12 & 17 respectively) * As others have shown in their photos, immediately below that, it lists a number of contaminents, with a checkmark as to whether the filter for that gallon rating filters each of the contaminents. Note that for the 750 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 12 and chlorobenzene is not checked. Note that for the 200 Gallon rating, contaminents reduced is 17 and cholorbenzene IS checked. Now, here's the key observation. On the front of my box it says in a bright pink callout \"Reduces 12 contaminents...\" Note that it does not say 17 contaminents, but 12. Also it does not mention chlorobenzene. From this I take it that UKF8001 filter that I received is rated 750 gallons, and does not filter chlorobenzene. I assume that if the filter were rated for 200 gallons and filtering chlorobenzene, then the box would be labeled on the front as filtering 17 contaminents, but I cannot prove this. I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has a box that has such a designation on the front to see how their box differs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Change at 6 months or 12 months ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Regarding changing the filter at 1 yr vs 6 months, here's what my refrigerator manual said about that: \"The filter monitor system measures the amount of water that passes through the filter and alerts you to replace the filter. When 90% of the filter's rated life is used, the yellow (Order) light comes on. When 100% of the filter's rated life is used, the red (Replace) light comes on, and it is recommended that you replace the filter. For models without filter status lights, replace the filter every 6 months. Use replacement filter model 67003523; order Part Number 4396395.\" From this I take it that some refrigerators are advanced enough to measure the amount of water that has passed through the system and to make recommendations as to when to change the filter. To determine this, you would need to check your fridge manual. If your refrigerator has such a feature, then you can probably go by the fridge's recommendation. Also, I suspect some fridges just go by the date and alert you after 6 months or a year. Or for those fridges that have a usage monitoring system, perhaps they alert you after six months or a year even if you haven't reached your maximum capacity rating. For example, I have an advanced fridge with the capacity monitor. I installed UKF8001 the last two times, and each time the fridge has indicated a need to change the filter at just about 1 yr, even though there is no way we used 750 gallons in that time frame. Probably this is to ensure the filter gets changed regularly whether you have met the usage profile or not. Regarding the fact that the box is stamped at 6 months even though it can be used for a full year and is rated at 750 Gallons, here's my theory. The filter manufacturer says that without a usage monitoring feature, their recommendation is 6 months. Probably the manufacturer stamps 6 months on the outside of the box since that is the shortest and most generic case (and also so they can sell more filters. Lol.) But the frequency you should change the filter will depend on your particular fridge, your usage, and your water quality. Finally, although the filter works just fine, I deducted one point from the rating because the packaging causes so much needless confusion.", "id": 1294452011}

I have always been a fan of Pur water filtration systems, so with this filter you get the great taste of Pur filtered water right out of your refrigerator. It lasts about 1 year and then a red light on the refrigerator comes on indicating that it is time to swap out the water filter. To be honest, the water didn't really taste bad at the year marker, so you might be able to get the filter to last longer than that. Can't say for sure, though, since we have always gone ahead and swapped it out anyways. It is super easy to install. It depends on your refrigerator, but on our Maytag the filter is on the inside of the refrigerator in the top back right corner. You open the filter door by pushing in the tab. Then turn the filter counter-clockwise to unscrew it. The filter will have some remaining water in it, so make sure that you keep it tilted up or you will have some water to wipe up. The new filter comes in shrink wrap plastic, so you take that off and then peal off the seal that covers the top of the filter. Insert the new filter where the old one was and turn clockwise to tighten. Don't over tighten it. Just get it snug. You will hear water rush into the filter as you are screwing it in. Then close the filter door. Last thing is to let some water run through the lines to remove all the air. I took a 1 gallon jug and just let the water fill it up. The instructions recommend running 4 gallons through to make sure you removed all the air. I only did 1 gallon and it seemed to be more than enough. That's it! Now you can just sit back and enjoy some clean filtered water. If you figure the price of buying bottled water vs. a new filter once a year, this is definitely a good deal at an average cost of about $2.50 a month.", "id": 1294452011}

Insert the new filter where the old one was and turn clockwise to tighten. Don't over tighten it. Just get it snug. You will hear water rush into the filter as you are screwing it in. Then close the filter door. Last thing is to let some water run through the lines to remove all the air. I took a 1 gallon jug and just let the water fill it up. The instructions recommend running 4 gallons through to make sure you removed all the air. I only did 1 gallon and it seemed to be more than enough. That's it! Now you can just sit back and enjoy some clean filtered water. If you figure the price of buying bottled water vs. a new filter once a year, this is definitely a good deal at an average cost of about $2.50 a month.", "id": 1297812011}
{"review": "This water filter produces great tasting water! I have always been a fan of Pur water filtration systems, so with this filter you get the great taste of Pur filtered water right out of your refrigerator. It lasts about 1 year and then a red light on the refrigerator comes on indicating that it is time to swap out the water filter. To be honest, the water didn't really taste bad at the year marker, so you might be able to get the filter to last longer than that. Can't say for sure, though, since we have always gone ahead and swapped it out anyways. It is super easy to install. It depends on your refrigerator, but on our Maytag the filter is on the inside of the refrigerator in the top back right corner. You open the filter door by pushing in the tab. Then turn the filter counter-clockwise to unscrew it. The filter will have some remaining water in it, so make sure that you keep it tilted up or you will have some water to wipe up.

{"review": "Wow! I'm a little shocked at the bad reviews! I bought this on black friday for $[...] and I LOVE it! I had previously used a swiffer sweep & vac (the battery died and it didn't clean up bigger messes) and then I bought the shark stick vac (one of my kids knocked it over and cracked it). So I purchased this as a third stick vac. I love it. It is very powerful, I don't understand these people saying it doesn't pick up messes. It totally picks up messes big and small!!! We remodeled our kitchen and I used it to vaccumm little sheetrock particles as well as the every day messes my 4, 5 year old kids & 3 year old lab leave behind. I have had some issues finding a new filter at walmart and target but I suspect I will find one easily online. Overall I LOVE this vac. I use it only for my tile areas and yes maybe you do have to empty it semi-often (but I have forgotten about it alot and never had a problem)it works great for cleaning up after my 2 kids and dog.", "id": 510114}

{"review": "I got this vacuum on one of those Black Friday deals, and wasn't expecting much, since it was so cheap, & the box was so light. When I opened it, and it went together like a lego toy, I was skeptical. But it's amazing!! It's never going to be your only vacuum if you have a big house (the wheel base is small, so you'd be doing a lot of walking back & forth), but if you have a little apartment, or want to keep a seperate vacuum upstairs, or in different rooms of your house, this vacuum is perfect for that! It's basically a hand-held vac, that has a detachable stick-handle, vacuum/wheel base, and crevice tool. Unlike the cordless hand-vacs, it doesn't lose power after 30 seconds, because it's electric. The crevice tool works great, and it's as light weight as one of those kids' toy vacuums. Also, when I emptied it (you will have to empty it pretty much every time you use it, but what do you expect?) I was shocked at how much dirt was in it- I'd just vacuumed with my expensive vacuum, the other day. I'm definitely glad I got this. I'd recommend it for apartment or dorm living, multi-level houses, and small offices.", "id": 510114}

{"review": "I picked up this little guy at Target for $20 for the sole purpose of cleaning my bathroom floors. It's small head easily gets around the toilet and under the vanities. This is NOT a vacuum for rugs, but it works great on bare floors picking up hair, lint, dust, etc. I liked it so much, I just bought another one for my downstairs. I love the hand held feature, combined with it's crevace tool. It is just great for getting at cobwebs behind fixtures. Again, this is not to be confused with a full sized, power brush vacuum for carpeting. But for small jobs on bare floors it is exactly right.", "id": 510114}

{"review": "While it is obvious this very cheap and small vacuum is not the ideal main vacuum of choice for regular vacuum days or actual houses, this is an absolute perfect product for small jobs or, better yet, smaller spaces (especially if you have). It's lightweight and multiple use design and very good suction power all add up to a great deal that work extremely well. I live in a college dorm and got it on sale (Amazon probably won't let me say much else), and could not have been happier. Given the space I live (I live in a one person room) in, it is perfect and spending any more money on a \"proper\" vacuum would be an utter waste of money. This is perfect for small bedrooms, smaller areas, dorms, and quick clean up jobs, with multi function to suit many needs and situations. Performance wise, it works great. I don't have much else to say here. The vacuum sucks up crumbs and other types of debris with ease, so there's nothing else to say here. Sure, the vacuum doesn't actually suck up, ummm, egg yolks, or something, but it will no doubt suck up the majority of typical debris you would expect you would need to vacuum up. Add this to a variety of ways you can vacuum via design and you have quite a good performance product. As far as the design of the vacuum itself, well, I was very satisfied. First off, the thing is very light, which makes it easy to carry, lift, and transport. It's easy to put together, and you can store it by just removing the head and the handle at the end. This also means that you can use more than one vacuum. You can use a regular vacuum, or you can use it as a hand vacuum as well. The hand vacuum also comes with a small attachment for getting into tight spaces, intended for use with the hand vacuum. A few things to know before you purchase this vacuum. As you might expect, a vacuum this small is not for an actual house, so don't bother with this vacuum if you want to make it a vacuum you would use in a regular home. Another thing I HIGHLY recommends is to always clean the filter and empty the vacuum after every use. Being small, it takes no time whatsoever and should not detract you from purchasing it, but is a precaution that should be always taken to ensure that the vacuum is not damaged. Once again, I can't recommend this vacuum enough. For its designed purpose, it works extremely well. Pick it up, it's inexpensive and works wonders for your situations. *Since it is obvious that ALL products have the potential to stop working, I will update this review if the vacuum stops working. However, the vacuum is still working fine so far. This is just a notification to show that this still works after a health amount of use (I purchased it at the beginning of the school year and have used it a healthy amount of times).", "id": 510114}

{"review": "Here in my apt. I find that dust accumulates very quickly and attaches to corners as dust balls. I also have a cat, which simply put adds to the problem terribly. I NEEDED a vacuum that was very cheap so that I could solve this without much fuss. I was tired of using a broomstick, which just makes the dust fly all over! So, let me explain what the Dirt Devil Vacuum does. A usual scenario: My floor has one layer of tiny dust particles attached to it and on top, the dust that moves around and collect as dust balls and cat hair with that. The vacuum picks up this moving dust/hair layer. My point being that, you cannot expect to remove the tiny dust attached to the floor, which you'd remove with a mop. You coould kind of do it, but you'd have to move the vacuum slowly over the floor (I don't have the time for that, so it doesn't do it for me). The vacuum works for what I bought it for, quickly remove general dust and cat hair (which it does really well). - The vacuum is VERY light, which is great for moving it around fast. The little wheels move smoothly, though it is too bad they only move back and forth (...not a big problem, since the vacuum is light you can slide it over the floor left and right just fine). - The attachment to clean corners, that thin tube you see in the picture, is pretty nice. I like that it has a flat shape all throughout, not round with a circular end. HOWEVER, it should be longer!! It's too small! Sure you can reach window corners like in the picture, but you can't reach behind tight areas. You'd have been able to if the tube was just longer or came with an extension. - The vacuum is small and comfortable to hold. - I find that the absorption area at the bottom should be bigger so that I can suck in a larger surface area. Well yea, nice product. You should get it if you are not looking for something very fancy and just want a quick solution for a problem like mine.", "id": 510114}

The vacuum works for what I bought it for, quickly remove general dust and cat hair (which it does really well). - The vacuum is VERY light, which is great for moving it around fast. The little wheels move smoothly, though it is too bad they only move back and forth (...not a big problem, since the vacuum is light you can slide it over the floor left and right just fine). - The attachment to clean corners, that thin tube you see in the picture, is pretty nice. I like that it has a flat shape all throughout, not round with a circular end. HOWEVER, it should be longer!! It's too small! Sure you can reach window corners like in the picture, but you can't reach behind tight areas. You'd have been able to if the tube was just longer or came with an extension. - The vacuum is small and comfortable to hold. - I find that the absorption area at the bottom should be bigger so that I can suck in a larger surface area. Well yea, nice product. You should get it if you are not looking for something very fancy and just want a quick solution for a problem like mine.", "id": 1294321011}
{"review": "Bought it at Target during black Friday for $9.99, then read that Walmart had it for $8. Boo! That said, it's a great little vacuum, so long as you adjust your expectation accordingly. Know that the actual suction opening does not run the entire span of the base, it's a small hole in the middle. I bought it hoping I can use it for the stairs but I think it'll take too long for it to cover the entire area; however, I must say that it works wonders in the bathroom and kitchen picking up cat litter, hair, and minor debris.", "id": 510114}

{"review": "I read reviews here for days before I settled on this little stick vac. And, from what I read, I was able to determine that I was able to use this as my only vac in a studio apt. with separate bedroom. I have not been disappointed. In fact, everytime I use it, I want to come and write more and more reviews about how great this machine is! I am, frankly, shocked and stunned. I use it for carpetless floors and also carpeted bedroom and living room. I also use it on the couch and on my bed. I have two cats in this small space so there is a lot to pick up! I recently started suffering with allergies for the first time in my life, so I've been vacuuming a lot to try to clean my environment as best I can. I have gone over the carpets twice in one day and each time the cup comes away full of hair, dirt, and unbelievably what must be the former tenants carpet fresh powder. Yes, it really does SUCK that hard. I am telling you, this is amazing! I have tried many, especially the cheap Eureka, which always lose power after only a couple of years. DD is just as inexpensive but superior in quality. I've been using this power stick for 8 months now and no loss in power in the least. I picked up a penny the other day when I was vacuuming. It picks up cat litter, too. Anyway, I need to buy a sealed HEPA filter vac now because of the mystery allergies, but I will never buy anything other than a Dust Devil from now on. In fact, I'm foregoing buying an air purifier because I am so confident that Dirt Devil products will get the job done. If you are tempted to buy, I will be selling my stick at a good price, so look for me in the Used prices. It is still phenomenal and like new.", "id": 510114}

{"review": "I had an old Panasonic rice cooker which had performed faithfully for almost 20 years, but it didn't have a Teflon pot and tended to scorch rice on the bottom -- especially brown rice. After reading countless reviews of various rice cookers, I decided to chance the Aroma ARC-914SBD. My experience has confirmed some of the tips and observations of previous reviews: ~ To avoid calamities, follow the directions in the user's manual, not what's on the rice package or what you used to do when cooking on the stove top. I was particularly surprised that brown rice takes no more water than white rice, but turns out beautifully. ~ The term \"cup\" does not mean an 8 ounce cup. It's actually 3/4 of a cup (6 ounces). I quickly discovered that trying to convert this idiosyncratic measurement scheme to standard English measurement is more trouble than it's worth. Just do what the directions say. ~ There's good reasons for this cooker's taking longer than stovetop cooking or what my old rice cooker took. It intentionally heats brown rice more slowly and apparently cooks at a lower temperature than with white rice. That's fine with me, since the result is perfectly cooked brown rice! ~ The top assembly is slightly more awkward to clean than a simple removable glass or metal top would be. It's really not much of an issue, but others have noticed it also. ~ The maximum capacity is claimed to be eight cups of cooked rice, which is actually six - 8 ounce cups. This is fine for one or two people, but may not be large enough for more people.

{"review": "I love this rice cooker. I had a rice cooker before and know how to cook it on stove-top but this makes it so much more convenient and easy. Cooks rice perfectly and is great for making steamed food and even stews and soups. Check out their website for recipes or just do a Google search for rice cooker or even steamer recipes. This rice cooker does come with a rice spatula which I wish it was more clear on since amazon does suggest to buy another set. It's not of the highest quality but it's plenty good for most everyone and won't break any time soon. It also has a water/steam collection container behind the lid on the right side of the electronic interface. Be sure to empty it every now and then, not essentially vital but if you don't, it'll eventually start leaking from being overfilled. I didn't notice it at first so wanted to let you guys know. I know this is obvious but be careful not to touch the steam vent while it's on. I'm a curious cat and I touched it and almost instantly burnt myself. :( No worries though, it's far from the handle. EDIT: After 6 months of constant use (3+ times/week), this rice cooker is still going strong.", "id": 678540011}

{"review": "I've had several rice cookers in the past, enjoyed them all and this is no exception. My last rice cooker, Zujirushi brand, only lasted 2 years before kicking the bucket, which was kinda odd since the past cookers lasted closer to 5. This is my first time trying the Aroma brand and so far, the experience is pretty nice. Coming from a guy who is use to the simple \"one-click\" function cookers, I thought this was easy to use. I've been using this on a weekly basis for about a month and so far no issues. Rice cooks a little bit longer than I'm accustomed to (about 20 mins for 3 cups of white rice), but the rice comes out great. Haven't use the steamer function yet. I've read some unhappy reviews about the rice being too dry, not cooked or too watery... I've had none of that. If it comes out too watery, you're probably adding too much water. Undercooked, it's probably broken. Too dry, you didn't add enough water. What most people don't understand, rice by different brands/variety will absorb water differently. You have to go judge how much water to put in by the rice you put in. I use Jasmine rice and the water marking on the pot is spot on. For $30-ish, I think this is a good deal. Pros: Cons: (So far) Reliable Cook time (about 20-25 mins) Easy to use Multi-function option", "id": 678540011}

{"review": "I have been making rice in a pot the \"regular way\" for so long that I didn't think it was necessary to buy a rice cooker. I have so many gadgets cluttering up my counter I didn't want another. However, I have recently switched to making more Brown Rice and I can never get it to turn out the way I want. After reading the reviews on this rice cooker I decided to give and and try it. SO GLAD I DID!!! It makes cooking rice a million times easier. Just pour in rice and water then push button and walk away--then come back to perfectly done rice! And my brown rice is terrific; plump, nutty, chewy and moist without being soggy. I have also cooked great White Rice, Quinoa and steamed veggies. This small size is perfect for our small family (or just me) and it has earned a place on the counter, even though it doesn't take up that much space. If you're on the fence about getting a rice cooker I would definitely recommend giving this one a try!", "id": 678540011}

{"review": "Overall we have found this to be a great water filter. But we have had our water tested by a professional, both at the tap, and at the filtered tap on the refrigerator. Both waters tested the same for chlorine content, however, the particle contaminants were greatly reduced by the filter on the refrigerator. Something to note on your water filter. The light is merely a timed indicator of when they want you to replace the filter. Think of it as a \"countdown timer\" that starts as soon as you reset it. It is in no way measuring the amount of water you are consuming... Personally, I used to change out the filter every 6 months when the indicator light came on, but we rarely use the water/ice now, so I haven't changed it (or reset it) in over a year although I probably will soon. I actually cut the first one in half to see how \"contaminated\" the filter was and to my surprise, it looked like a brand new filter... The life of a filter depends on a couple of things. 1. The amount of contaminants in your water (well water is typically the worst) 2. The amount of water that passes through the filter If you have low contaminants and/or use very little filtered water, your filter will last much longer than 6 months. If you pay attention to the amount of water flow and the size of your ice cubes, you can more accurately determine the proper time to replace the filter. I have county water and we also have installed a \"whole house\" water filtration system, so I can probably get closer to 2 years out of a filter. Obviously, not everyone has these installed though, just use common sense on when to replace your filter and you'll be fine. P.S. Why is it more expensive per unit to buy the 3-pack than it is to buy the 2-pack? Am I the only one that found this odd?", "id": 1294452011}

{"review": "We purchased a new Whirlpool refrigerator earlier this year. The new refrigerator has all the marvelous improvements developed in the last ten years for refrigerators, including a water filter. The water filter really does deliver better water. However, the water filter seems quite expensive to me. Whirlpool, and other manufacturer's that use this type of filter, recommend the filter be replaced twice a year, whether you need to replace the filter or not. The filter is relatively easy to replace, but be aware of what happens when you pull the filter. To remove the old filter you push a button next to the filter, typically to the left of the filter. Then pull on the cap covering the filter and pull the filter out. Make a note of how the filter was oriented when you pull it out. The filter will now begin dripping water, so have a paper towel or small bowl available to let the water drip into. You can either let the filter finish dripping into a sink, or throw it into a plastic bag that you can seal to keep the water from dripping out of the bag. Be sure you remove the cover from the filter before you toss it. On our Whirlpool the cover twists counterclockwise for removal. Install the filter cover onto the new filter. It takes just a twist to lock it into place. Holding the filter so that the two straight pieces on the end of the filter are vertical, with the open portion of the filter cover oriented on the bottom, slide the new filter straight into the filter cavity until the button on the left clicks to let you know the new filter is locked into place. Note that these instructions are for a Whirlpool, but I believe most other refrigerators are similar. You should be ready to go! Had I known refrigerator water filters were so expensive I might have gone with a refrigerator without one, though our local water has a lot of chlorine in it (which is filtered out by the filter). As with many modern conveniences, this water filter represents a convenience that you did not know you needed until you had it. Now that I have it, I am wondering whether I want it since I have to spend a chunk of change each year in filter replacements. Oh well. I guess I can sleep more soundly knowing that the water filter is now removing a bunch of stuff from my water that my body either did not want or need. Good luck!", "id": 1294452011}

{"review": "Since I had had previous experience with Pur water filters, we purchased a side-by-side water and ice dispenser Whirlpool fridge over a year ago that uses these filters and they have made a huge difference in the quality of our water. We live in Riverview, FL, a suburb of Tampa, and the water here is so foul that I sometimes wonder if I have an odor from it after I shower. Since it smelled that bad coming from the tap I knew I was not going to drink it, cook with it, nor give it to my cats. So, to save us the expense of buying bottled water, we bought the fridge. Yes, the filters are expensive, but they are Pur water filters which, in my opinion, are better than Brita. I would rather have the expense than get sick drinking nasty water. Since I use the filtered water for just about everything, I have to replace my filter more frequently, but it is well worth the cost. To save a few bucks, I order my filter online and three at a time; this usually saves me $3-5.00 per filter. Just search for the item number of the filter and you will find several places that sell it either as a single, a three-pack, a four-pack or a six-pack.

{"review": "I have purchased this refrigerator filter several times before from other sources, and have never had a problem. This time I found Amazon had the best price, so I bought here and even signed up for the subscription service, which gave me a 15% discount and would automatically reorder the item every 6 months. The item arrived, and I waited until my then-current filter needed replacing. At that time I got out the new filter and tried to install it. I have done this with replacement filters before and it's always been quick and easy. This time I removed the old filter, took off the cap and placed it on the new filter, and tried inserting the new filter. The new filter went all the way in but would not catch and stay in, it kept popping back out. I switched back to the old filter and it went in just fine. I tried this repeatedly, as did a friend, and we always got the same result. I tried to request a replacement online at Amazon, but was unable to do so because it was past the 30-day deadline after the purchase. I searched all over the site and found no way to contact an actual person to explain the situation. I contacted Whirlpool directly twice, and both times was told they could do nothing about my defective item because I had ordered through Amazon. Today on a whim I Googled \"contact amazon.com\" and found a phone number. After a lengthy discussion the end result was that Amazon will let me return the item, but will charge me a restocking fee. The kicker is, they won't tell me what the fee is, they expect me to just return the item and then they will refund whatever amount is left after that fee. Despite my pointing out what a ridiculous practice that is, and mentioning that I will both cancel my subscription and post a negative review, that was the best I could get them to do. So now I am posting this review and will cancel my subscription for future filter purchases. I have bought literally hundreds of items online over the past couple decades, and am really surprised that a company claiming to have such great customer service is responding this way. I don't think I've ever posted a negative review before, but I want others to know that if they buy this item direct from Amazon, they need to check it right away even if they won't be using it for a while, or risk getting stuck with a defective item, no refund/replacement, and lots of time wasted.

So we Re-disinfected the well and the fun task of disinfecting ALL of the water lines. We also cleaned & changed the salt in softener & re-checked the settings.

As the other reviewer commented.. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THESE FILTERS! I'm purchasing elsewhere in the future. Hope these filters are investigated so we can find what type of substance was causing the weird taste..and find out if it causes any ill effects for those that have consumed the water!! if i could have rated them LESS than one star.. or a scary star I would have.

{"review": "Length:: 4:33 Mins UPDATE: 11/19/2013 - This particular dehumidifier is not involoved in the September 12, 2013 Gree Dehumidifier Recall. That recall is only for the following Frigidaire models...FDB30R1, FDB50R1, FDB70R1, FDD25S1, FDF50S1, FDF70S1, FDL30R1, FDL50R1, FDL50S1, FDL70R1, FDL70S1, FDM30R1, FDR30S1 The last 5 dehumidifiers I have purchased (3 Kenmore dehumidifiers and 2 Frigidaires) have all failed within 5 years of purchase and 2 of the 4 have failed within a year of purchase. In my experience the reliability of dehumidifiers in general has diminished greatly over the years. So every time I have to purchase another, I do the research all over again and I find myself going in circles. All brands seem to have similar complaints having to do with longevity. Consequently, I always purchase an extended warranty now. For the $40 or so that they cost, it gives you some peace of mind that at least you will be able to get a replacement if the dehumidifier should break down outside of the manufacturers warranty period. My first Frigidaire dehumidifier was the FAD704TDP, purchased in April 2011. That lasted just slightly over a year before breaking down. The compressor failed. I was in luck because even though the 1-year warranty had just expired, the compressor was warrantied for 5-years. Whew, dodged a bullet there. I had read elsewhere that Frigidaire was notoriously difficult to deal with regarding warranty repair/replacement. In my experience, what Frigidaire does instead of sending you a new unit is to \"buy back\" your old unit. You don't return it to them, they just send you a check. Fortunately Frigidaire \"bought\" my defective unit back from me and using the proceeds I was able to replace it with the FAD704DUD. Contrary to some peoples hassles with Frigidaire warranty issues, I had no problem whatsoever with my interaction with Frigidaire. The check was sent to me promptly and with no problems. I did a lot of further research and decided that all manufacturers had their share of disgruntled customers so I decided to give Frigidaire another chance and purchased my second Frigidaire dehumidifier, the FAD704DUD 70 pint dehumidifier to replace the defective. That one was purchased June 2012 and is still working. However, I live in the North East and right now it's the tail end of winter so the dehumidifier, although it is plugged in and turned on, hasn't actually had to operate since the Fall of 2012. I'm assuming it will work just fine come spring and the ensuing damp weather. But given the history I've had with dehumidifiers, they seem to work no longer than 3-5 years before breaking down, I had an opportunity to get this FAD704DWD and did so even though the dehumidifier I bought last year seemingly still works fine. The outward appearance of this dehumidifier is identical to the FAD704DUD. The only differences between this 2013 model: FAD704DWD and the 2012 model: FAD704DUD are some minor changes in the specifications: FAD704DWD (2013) FAD704DUD (2012) Amps (Cool): 7.8 vs Amps (Cool): 7.2 Horsepower (Cool): 1.00 vs Horsepower (Cool): 1.03 Watts (Cool): 745 vs Watts (Cool): 765 So as you can see, the FAD704DWD uses 20 less Watts of electricity. But as you'll also notice, the Horsepower has been reduced slightly so I'm not sure if the operation of the unit will be quite the same. I do noticed a very minor change in the tone of fan blower. It sounds like it might be running just a touch slower than the last years model. Very minor, but maybe that's all it takes to reduce energy consumption by 20 watts. When I received the new dehumidifier and removed the tape that secures the collection tank to the unit, I discovered that the float assembly was not attached where it was supposed to be attached and was just flopping around in the bottom of the tank. There was also a broken piece of clear plastic that I still haven't quite figured out where it came from yet. But I plan to take the entire thing apart to find out where it broke off from. I carefully reattached the float assembly and was good to go., I like the profile and appearance of this dehumidifier. It's exactly the same dimensions of last years model. It is not very deep nor wide, but it is somewhat tall. It measures roughly 16\" wide, 11\" deep and 24.5\" tall. The cord length is 6' 6\" and there is a cord wrap on the back of the unit. The plug is a 3-prong grounded plug. The fan is not exceedingly loud but it's not whisper quiet... perfectly tolerable though. If it's in your basement and not in your direct earshot, you probably won't ever hear it operate at all. The fan blows the exhaust out of the top of the unit which I feel it circulates the air better than blowing it out the side which is where some units have the fan output. The collection container hold 16.3 pints and has a handle to help you carry it over to a sink. However, It just does not have a decent way to tip the bucket easily to pour the water out. I am always sloshing and spilling water all over the place when I try emptying the full bucket. It's awkward. Plus, 16.3 pints may sound like a lot of capacity but it fills rather quickly in my climate so I use the \"continuous operation\" method. My dehumidifier is located near my sump pump in my basement. I attach a hose to the dehumidifier and route that right into the sump pump. It's a great way to do it because I do not have to be bothered with emptying the dehumidifier and it is able to run continuously. The timer may not work like you think it will work. You can set the timer to turn off the dehumidifier from .5 to 24 hours from the time that you set it. Or you can set the dehumidifier to come on from .5 to 24 hours in the future when the dehumidifier is off. But either scenario is a one-time only event. Also worth noting is that the dehumidifier fan will shut off after the dehumidifier has reached the level of humidity you have selected. Before that happens, you may hear the fan stay on but the compressor will be turning on and off periodically. It is possible that you will never hear the fan turn off if you have set the humidity level lower than the dehumidifier can attain... so in effect it will be running continuously. Overall I'm very pleased with the Frigidaire FAD704DWD 70-pint dehumidifier. I withold 5 stars simply because of the longevity issues I've discussed. Should this prove to be long-lasting, I will update my review and provide an update.", "id": 9425949011}

Fortunately Frigidaire \"bought\" my defective unit back from me and using the proceeds I was able to replace it with the FAD704DUD. Contrary to some peoples hassles with Frigidaire warranty issues, I had no problem whatsoever with my interaction with Frigidaire. The check was sent to me promptly and with no problems. I did a lot of further research and decided that all manufacturers had their share of disgruntled customers so I decided to give Frigidaire another chance and purchased my second Frigidaire dehumidifier, the FAD704DUD 70 pint dehumidifier to replace the defective. That one was purchased June 2012 and is still working. However, I live in the North East and right now it's the tail end of winter so the dehumidifier, although it is plugged in and turned on, hasn't actually had to operate since the Fall of 2012. I'm assuming it will work just fine come spring and the ensuing damp weather. But given the history I've had with dehumidifiers, they seem to work no longer than 3-5 years before breaking down, I had an opportunity to get this FAD704DWD and did so even though the dehumidifier I bought last year seemingly still works fine. The outward appearance of this dehumidifier is identical to the FAD704DUD. The only differences between this 2013 model: FAD704DWD and the 2012 model: FAD704DUD are some minor changes in the specifications: FAD704DWD (2013) FAD704DUD (2012) Amps (Cool): 7.8 vs Amps (Cool): 7.2 Horsepower (Cool): 1.00 vs Horsepower (Cool): 1.03 Watts (Cool): 745 vs Watts (Cool): 765 So as you can see, the FAD704DWD uses 20 less Watts of electricity. But as you'll also notice, the Horsepower has been reduced slightly so I'm not sure if the operation of the unit will be quite the same. I do noticed a very minor change in the tone of fan blower. It sounds like it might be running just a touch slower than the last years model. Very minor, but maybe that's all it takes to reduce energy consumption by 20 watts. When I received the new dehumidifier and removed the tape that secures the collection tank to the unit, I discovered that the float assembly was not attached where it was supposed to be attached and was just flopping around in the bottom of the tank. There was also a broken piece of clear plastic that I still haven't quite figured out where it came from yet. But I plan to take the entire thing apart to find out where it broke off from. I carefully reattached the float assembly and was good to go., I like the profile and appearance of this dehumidifier. It's exactly the same dimensions of last years model. It is not very deep nor wide, but it is somewhat tall. It measures roughly 16\" wide, 11\" deep and 24.5\" tall. The cord length is 6' 6\" and there is a cord wrap on the back of the unit. The plug is a 3-prong grounded plug. The fan is not exceedingly loud but it's not whisper quiet... perfectly tolerable though. If it's in your basement and not in your direct earshot, you probably won't ever hear it operate at all. The fan blows the exhaust out of the top of the unit which I feel it circulates the air better than blowing it out the side which is where some units have the fan output. The collection container hold 16.3 pints and has a handle to help you carry it over to a sink. However, It just does not have a decent way to tip the bucket easily to pour the water out. I am always sloshing and spilling water all over the place when I try emptying the full bucket. It's awkward. Plus, 16.3 pints may sound like a lot of capacity but it fills rather quickly in my climate so I use the \"continuous operation\" method. My dehumidifier is located near my sump pump in my basement. I attach a hose to the dehumidifier and route that right into the sump pump. It's a great way to do it because I do not have to be bothered with emptying the dehumidifier and it is able to run continuously. The timer may not work like you think it will work. You can set the timer to turn off the dehumidifier from .5 to 24 hours from the time that you set it. Or you can set the dehumidifier to come on from .5 to 24 hours in the future when the dehumidifier is off. But either scenario is a one-time only event. Also worth noting is that the dehumidifier fan will shut off after the dehumidifier has reached the level of humidity you have selected. Before that happens, you may hear the fan stay on but the compressor will be turning on and off periodically. It is possible that you will never hear the fan turn off if you have set the humidity level lower than the dehumidifier can attain... so in effect it will be running continuously. Overall I'm very pleased with the Frigidaire FAD704DWD 70-pint dehumidifier. I withold 5 stars simply because of the longevity issues I've discussed. Should this prove to be long-lasting, I will update my review and provide an update.", "id": 13900811}

{"review": "I decided to do a quick initial review of this 70 pint dehumidifier since everyone will be looking at getting one for the summer season soon. I will update durability in future months. I received this May 2013. It came delivered in its original box very quickly (2 days) shipped UPS. It says on the box not to lay on its side. I recommend upon receiving this unit to leave it sit for 24 hours before plugging in when you get it in its final resting spot just in case someone along the way shipped it on it's side to let the compressor oil drain back down. The shipping box seemed sufficient, however It did come with a crack in the plastic back due to an impact. The box appears to be able to flex on the backside enough and there is only foam protection on the ends. Amazon of course took care of me on this. On to the initial review. The design of the cabinet is tasteful and has a few features I liked over my past Fedders unit. Thoughtful features like an integrated handle that hides away at the top when not in use. The unit rolls easily on its caster without tipping. The bucket has a red ball in it to show you water level and a flip down handle to assist in the emptying process. I also liked the way the hose outlet was molded into the cabinet with a screw on plug. Past units I have owned seemed the hose connection was an afterthought. The only feature I thought was oddly placed was the reusable filter which can only be accessed when the bucket is removed. The control panel is nicely layed out and includes power, fan speed, humidity control and a handy timer function in which you can program it to come on in so many hours from now when the energy costs are lower. Very legible 2 digit readout for humidity and can be adjusted in increments of 5% down to 35, or continuous operation. When you are adjusting the levels the readout reflects your setting and when you release the buttons it then reads the room humidity. There is also a filter reset on the top panel. After so many hours of operation it will remind you to clean it. I set the humidity to 50 and turned the fan on high. The compressor does not start right away and seems to take 5 min to kick in. I played with the high low fan speed. There is a noticeable lower noise between the two, but not enough to make me want to leave it in low. On to the energy use. When the unit is plugged in with nothing running it appears to use about 2 watts of power, but not continuous. I noticed it reads 2 watts intermittently, maybe coming on to check the humidity level. If this is the case, it would only need to do this once every couple of minutes instead of every 20 seconds or so like it does. When the fan is in the low position with the compressor off, it uses 58 watts and when it is in high it uses 66 watts. Not a lot of energy savings, but a bit of payoff (slight) in noise. The air is sucked in the front and ejected out the top vents. When the compressor kicks in the noise does not increase by much at all and can hardly be heard over the fan noise. Initially with the compressor running and the fan on high the wattage consumed was between 630 and 591, fluctuating. As the unit ran for a couple of days this seemed to drop to a steady 578, well below the wattage in the spec, possible the compressor breaking in?. Instead of water dripping continuously out of the hose connector, it seems to be ejected at regular intervals. This interval initially was every 16 seconds. The amount of water ejected was 7.5ml. The water being pulled out was well over the 70 pints a day, somewhere just over 90 pints. This continued for the first couple of days and now seems to be ejecting about 7ml every 35 seconds. I will continue to monitor this as time goes on. It may just be that the humidity was so high it was taking more out than the rated average. Overall I am satisfied with it so far. I highly recommend using the hose end as you will be dumping that 16.3 pint bucket a few times a day. If you do not have a floor drain, maybe look into a model with a built in pump for a few dollars more to pump it up to a sink. Something notable about the noise. I did find it quieter than my fedders model and since it is in my basement I don't care much. If you are watching TV beside it you may be annoyed. Thanks to John M Yelton, I can now confirm that the fan DOES shut off when the dialed in humidity has been reached. On average it takes about 7 minutes after the compressor shuts off for the fan to go off. This is a bit annoying, but perhaps it will eliminate rust issues I noticed my fedder unit had after a few years as the coils get a chance to air dry after they start to go back to room temp. I did notice though that the unit doesn't stay off for long. Between the 7 min fan cycle it give the sensor a bit of time to activate the compressor so it seems that it just shuts off, then the compressor kicks in again 5 min later to take some more moisture out of the room and it just repeats itself. Mind you, I am drying a 2000 square foot basement and this will probably slow down as it drys out. Keep in mind this is the first few days of operation, and since I am on \"time of use\" hydro billing, it has been off much of the day since that is the expensive time to operate. I have an idea for mine to be turned on only when my hydro is at its cheapest (7pm to 7am) For those of us with home automation you could say run this unit 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday, and all weekend (cheapest energy rate times). This unit could be controlled remotely by utilizing the bucket full contact switch. UPDATE May 11 -2013. The wattage consumed continues to drop. I monitored it again for an hour and it has dropped below 500 watts, in the 480 range (A far cry from the 745 Watts they rate it for) so this is a pleasant surprise. I will continue to monitor this. It could be the compressor loosening up an not having to work as hard (hopefully) and not something else. I also noticed the time between moisture ejects has increased from 7.5 ml every 16 seconds to 7.5 ml every 60 or so seconds. A sign my basement is getting drier I suppose. Happy so far.", "id": 9425949011}

I recommend upon receiving this unit to leave it sit for 24 hours before plugging in when you get it in its final resting spot just in case someone along the way shipped it on it's side to let the compressor oil drain back down. The shipping box seemed sufficient, however It did come with a crack in the plastic back due to an impact. The box appears to be able to flex on the backside enough and there is only foam protection on the ends. Amazon of course took care of me on this. On to the initial review. The design of the cabinet is tasteful and has a few features I liked over my past Fedders unit. Thoughtful features like an integrated handle that hides away at the top when not in use. The unit rolls easily on its caster without tipping. The bucket has a red ball in it to show you water level and a flip down handle to assist in the emptying process. I also liked the way the hose outlet was molded into the cabinet with a screw on plug. Past units I have owned seemed the hose connection was an afterthought. The only feature I thought was oddly placed was the reusable filter which can only be accessed when the bucket is removed. The control panel is nicely layed out and includes power, fan speed, humidity control and a handy timer function in which you can program it to come on in so many hours from now when the energy costs are lower. Very legible 2 digit readout for humidity and can be adjusted in increments of 5% down to 35, or continuous operation. When you are adjusting the levels the readout reflects your setting and when you release the buttons it then reads the room humidity. There is also a filter reset on the top panel. After so many hours of operation it will remind you to clean it. I set the humidity to 50 and turned the fan on high. The compressor does not start right away and seems to take 5 min to kick in. I played with the high low fan speed. There is a noticeable lower noise between the two, but not enough to make me want to leave it in low. On to the energy use. When the unit is plugged in with nothing running it appears to use about 2 watts of power, but not continuous. I noticed it reads 2 watts intermittently, maybe coming on to check the humidity level. If this is the case, it would only need to do this once every couple of minutes instead of every 20 seconds or so like it does. When the fan is in the low position with the compressor off, it uses 58 watts and when it is in high it uses 66 watts. Not a lot of energy savings, but a bit of payoff (slight) in noise. The air is sucked in the front and ejected out the top vents. When the compressor kicks in the noise does not increase by much at all and can hardly be heard over the fan noise. Initially with the compressor running and the fan on high the wattage consumed was between 630 and 591, fluctuating. As the unit ran for a couple of days this seemed to drop to a steady 578, well below the wattage in the spec, possible the compressor breaking in?. Instead of water dripping continuously out of the hose connector, it seems to be ejected at regular intervals. This interval initially was every 16 seconds. The amount of water ejected was 7.5ml. The water being pulled out was well over the 70 pints a day, somewhere just over 90 pints. This continued for the first couple of days and now seems to be ejecting about 7ml every 35 seconds. I will continue to monitor this as time goes on. It may just be that the humidity was so high it was taking more out than the rated average. Overall I am satisfied with it so far. I highly recommend using the hose end as you will be dumping that 16.3 pint bucket a few times a day. If you do not have a floor drain, maybe look into a model with a built in pump for a few dollars more to pump it up to a sink. Something notable about the noise. I did find it quieter than my fedders model and since it is in my basement I don't care much. If you are watching TV beside it you may be annoyed. Thanks to John M Yelton, I can now confirm that the fan DOES shut off when the dialed in humidity has been reached. On average it takes about 7 minutes after the compressor shuts off for the fan to go off. This is a bit annoying, but perhaps it will eliminate rust issues I noticed my fedder unit had after a few years as the coils get a chance to air dry after they start to go back to room temp. I did notice though that the unit doesn't stay off for long. Between the 7 min fan cycle it give the sensor a bit of time to activate the compressor so it seems that it just shuts off, then the compressor kicks in again 5 min later to take some more moisture out of the room and it just repeats itself. Mind you, I am drying a 2000 square foot basement and this will probably slow down as it drys out. Keep in mind this is the first few days of operation, and since I am on \"time of use\" hydro billing, it has been off much of the day since that is the expensive time to operate. I have an idea for mine to be turned on only when my hydro is at its cheapest (7pm to 7am) For those of us with home automation you could say run this unit 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday, and all weekend (cheapest energy rate times). This unit could be controlled remotely by utilizing the bucket full contact switch. UPDATE May 11 -2013. The wattage consumed continues to drop. I monitored it again for an hour and it has dropped below 500 watts, in the 480 range (A far cry from the 745 Watts they rate it for) so this is a pleasant surprise. I will continue to monitor this. It could be the compressor loosening up an not having to work as hard (hopefully) and not something else. I also noticed the time between moisture ejects has increased from 7.5 ml every 16 seconds to 7.5 ml every 60 or so seconds. A sign my basement is getting drier I suppose.

{"review": "This review compares these big dehumidifiers: - Frigidaire 70 pint (FAD704DUD) - SoleusAir 70 pint (DP1-70-03) - LG 65 pint (LG651EBL) NOTES/WARNINGS: ------------------- - If you have a medical/allergy, anti-mold, archival, or otherwise serious reason to maintain a humidity range you need to get something SEPARATE TO MEASURE HUMIDITY. The Frigidaire thought the humidity was 5-9 RH higher than it was as measured by 2 humidity instruments including a data logger, the SoleusAir was off by more than that, the LG doesn't show what it thinks the humidity is. For example, here are some settings and resulting relative humidity ranges for the Frigidaire in my tests: Setting Humidity_Range_Result 50 41.0-45.0 55 46.0-49.5 60 51.5-54.5 - Be sure to have a 3-PRONG OUTLET for each dehumidifier you get, NO 2-prong with adapter shortcuts, you want this kind of appliance grounded, like a refrigerator or air conditioner. - Running big dehumidifiers non-stop often costs hundreds of dollars per year each and it may only bring the humidity lower than needed for comfort, medical, or archival purpose. Consider aiming for just below your target, for example 53 RH to keep below 55 RH rather than continuous running to get as low as possible. Of course, if it takes continuously running to get to the target, ignore this suggestion :). Sometimes you can get BIG savings by not doing more dehumidifying than you need. For example, we set our Frigidaire in the basement to 60, which gives us 51.5-54.5 RH on a range, anything lower is a waste of electricity for us. Using the average cost of electricity in the U.S. of 12 cents per Kilowatt Hour you can see the savings below: Setting Humidity_Range_Result Watt_Hrs Cost/Yr_at_12cents_per_kWhr 50 41.0-45.0 11738 $428 55 46.0-49.5 10403 $380 60 51.5-54.5 970 $35 <-- Not a misprint - I highly suggest getting no-fault extended warranty for 2+ years if you can get it for any dehumidifier, even though I rarely bother with them for other products. - If you need to reliably pump a few feet up to get into a sink (for drainage), for example, ignore all of this and look at something like the Friedrich 70 pint with the built-in pump. - See near bottom of review for section on one inexpensive easy way to get the water right into the drain (for example, if you have pets tempted by dribbling water - its not drinking water). - The LG has pretty terrible reviews on Amazon regarding durability. Also, note that LG made the Sears Kenmore Dehumidifiers sold up to 2009 that are being recalled last year due to fire risk. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW NOISY (dBA) I FOUND THEM TO REALLY BE AT MAX FAN SPEED: -------------------------- dBA at distances (1'/5'/10'/15'): Frigidaire: 62.0 / 56.0 / 53.0 / 51.5 SolieusAir: 66.0 / 60.5 / 57.5 / 55.5 LG: 58.5 / 55.5 / 53.0 / 50.0 If your primary concern is noise then you might want to avoid the SoleusAir. Since Frigidaire is so much better reviewed than the LG, I'd lean towards the Frigidaire over LG for this since the loudness difference is fairly small unless you are going to be fairly close to it. I should note that the nature of the noise of the Frigidaire is more like white noise from a strong fan as you rarely hear much from the unit's compressor over the fan. HOW MUCH WATER I FOUND THEY ACTUALLY HOLD: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 17.7 lbs SoleusAir: 13.4 lbs LG: 15.8 lbs If you can't use a drain and you want it to do as much work as it can during the night or while you are at work, then Frigidaire wins here. If water hauling weight is a primary concern then SoleusAir has an edge here. HOW MUCH WATER I FOUND THEY CAN REALLY PULL OUT OF THE AIR IN AN HOUR AT MAX FAN SPEED: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 0.82 lbs water per hour SoleusAir: 0.69 \" LG: 0.53 \" If sheer power is your main concern, for example correcting an 18 RH humidity spike ASAP after towels go through the dryer, Frigidaire wins here. These numbers are an average of the bottom two runs out of three tests I did for each unit. Note that the first Frigidaire I tested performed poorly at 0.47 lbs of water per hour. I returned it and the new one I got 3 months later did this well which much better reflects the performance satisfaction by a leading consumer magazine. HOW COST EFFICIENT I FOUND THEY ARE TO RUN: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 645 Watt Hours electricity to remove 1 lb. of water SoleusAir: 690 \" LG: 800 \" This is not extrapolated from data sheets, this was measured. The LG will likely overall cost more to operate, the Frigidaire and SoleusAir win here. These numbers are an average of the bottom two out of three test runs for each unit. HOW MUCH TIME TO FILL THEIR BUCKET IN WINTER IN ONE EXAMPLE BASEMENT AT TOP FAN SPEED: ------------------------- Frigidaire: 0.9 days SoleusAir: 0.8 days LG: 1.2 days Remember that the bins hold different amounts of water. The full range for the Frigidaire in my tests was 0.74-0.92 days to fill its bucket. MISC. NOTES: -------------- Frigidaire: Easily the most attractive, build quality is excellent. Well reviewed by respected independent consumer magazine. Has top and side handles. Look out for cleaning filter light going on erroneously early on in order to facilitate an exchange while it is still easy to do. It is easy to spot, after going off early you would clean the filter put it back in and it would still be on. As noted above, the first Frigidaire dehumidifier I bought was performance defective and I returned it. These numbers are from testing the replacement. LG: As noted above, has pretty bad reviews on Amazon regarding durability. Vents out the back and thus requires 1' distance from a wall, the others vent upwards. So expect in some cases to have to point the front to the wall and spin it around to remove the bin (if you use a bin) now and then (easy to do, just FYI). Has no top handle only side handles, the others have top and side handles. If it ever goes up steps you will likely wish it had the top handle. All: All of them had easy to remove and place bins with good handles and were tough to spill unless not paying attention (I've read a review saying LG was bad for spilling the bin, though I didn't find it difficult, but I thought I should mention it FYI). They all have wheels. I often don't get no-fault replacement warranties, but I would definitely get 2+ year one for these. CAN THESE REALLY HELP AFTER A FLOOD: --------------------- After a week running continuously at full fan speed the wet/damp smell from a little flood in the basement went away. GIVE ME A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OF ON-GOING UTILITY: ---------------------- To help prevent basement mold we target 50-55 RH as a cost efficient target. We found to get this we need to set the dehumidifier to a higher target value (in our case 65 RH in Winter, 60 RH in Spring), your unit will vary, see warning above about needing a separate humidity meter). Ordinarily our basement ranges from 54-59 RH or so in Winter. Depending on what we set the dehumidifier to we can target a 3-4 RH range anywhere between 38rh to 54rh (we didn't test higher) but couldn't get it lower than 38 RH with a single dehumidifier for our middle-sized basement. If we wanted to keep it down to 38-41 RH by running it continuously I measured it costs around 6x-10x more in kWh of electricity (depending on time of year), thus costing hundreds of dollars more per year, compared to keeping it in the 50-55 RH range which meets many folks basement needs. Obviously your mileage will vary by time of year, geography, unit, air leakage, etc., this is just one real world example, hope it helps!

Consider aiming for just below your target, for example 53 RH to keep below 55 RH rather than continuous running to get as low as possible. Of course, if it takes continuously running to get to the target, ignore this suggestion :). Sometimes you can get BIG savings by not doing more dehumidifying than you need. For example, we set our Frigidaire in the basement to 60, which gives us 51.5-54.5 RH on a range, anything lower is a waste of electricity for us. Using the average cost of electricity in the U.S. of 12 cents per Kilowatt Hour you can see the savings below: Setting Humidity_Range_Result Watt_Hrs Cost/Yr_at_12cents_per_kWhr 50 41.0-45.0 11738 $428 55 46.0-49.5 10403 $380 60 51.5-54.5 970 $35 <-- Not a misprint - I highly suggest getting no-fault extended warranty for 2+ years if you can get it for any dehumidifier, even though I rarely bother with them for other products. - If you need to reliably pump a few feet up to get into a sink (for drainage), for example, ignore all of this and look at something like the Friedrich 70 pint with the built-in pump. - See near bottom of review for section on one inexpensive easy way to get the water right into the drain (for example, if you have pets tempted by dribbling water - its not drinking water). - The LG has pretty terrible reviews on Amazon regarding durability. Also, note that LG made the Sears Kenmore Dehumidifiers sold up to 2009 that are being recalled last year due to fire risk. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW NOISY (dBA) I FOUND THEM TO REALLY BE AT MAX FAN SPEED: -------------------------- dBA at distances (1'/5'/10'/15'): Frigidaire: 62.0 / 56.0 / 53.0 / 51.5 SolieusAir: 66.0 / 60.5 / 57.5 / 55.5 LG: 58.5 / 55.5 / 53.0 / 50.0 If your primary concern is noise then you might want to avoid the SoleusAir. Since Frigidaire is so much better reviewed than the LG, I'd lean towards the Frigidaire over LG for this since the loudness difference is fairly small unless you are going to be fairly close to it. I should note that the nature of the noise of the Frigidaire is more like white noise from a strong fan as you rarely hear much from the unit's compressor over the fan. HOW MUCH WATER I FOUND THEY ACTUALLY HOLD: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 17.7 lbs SoleusAir: 13.4 lbs LG: 15.8 lbs If you can't use a drain and you want it to do as much work as it can during the night or while you are at work, then Frigidaire wins here. If water hauling weight is a primary concern then SoleusAir has an edge here. HOW MUCH WATER I FOUND THEY CAN REALLY PULL OUT OF THE AIR IN AN HOUR AT MAX FAN SPEED: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 0.82 lbs water per hour SoleusAir: 0.69 \" LG: 0.53 \" If sheer power is your main concern, for example correcting an 18 RH humidity spike ASAP after towels go through the dryer, Frigidaire wins here. These numbers are an average of the bottom two runs out of three tests I did for each unit. Note that the first Frigidaire I tested performed poorly at 0.47 lbs of water per hour. I returned it and the new one I got 3 months later did this well which much better reflects the performance satisfaction by a leading consumer magazine. HOW COST EFFICIENT I FOUND THEY ARE TO RUN: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 645 Watt Hours electricity to remove 1 lb. of water SoleusAir: 690 \" LG: 800 \" This is not extrapolated from data sheets, this was measured. The LG will likely overall cost more to operate, the Frigidaire and SoleusAir win here. These numbers are an average of the bottom two out of three test runs for each unit. HOW MUCH TIME TO FILL THEIR BUCKET IN WINTER IN ONE EXAMPLE BASEMENT AT TOP FAN SPEED: ------------------------- Frigidaire: 0.9 days SoleusAir: 0.8 days LG: 1.2 days Remember that the bins hold different amounts of water. The full range for the Frigidaire in my tests was 0.74-0.92 days to fill its bucket. MISC. NOTES: -------------- Frigidaire: Easily the most attractive, build quality is excellent. Well reviewed by respected independent consumer magazine. Has top and side handles. Look out for cleaning filter light going on erroneously early on in order to facilitate an exchange while it is still easy to do. It is easy to spot, after going off early you would clean the filter put it back in and it would still be on. As noted above, the first Frigidaire dehumidifier I bought was performance defective and I returned it. These numbers are from testing the replacement. LG: As noted above, has pretty bad reviews on Amazon regarding durability. Vents out the back and thus requires 1' distance from a wall, the others vent upwards. So expect in some cases to have to point the front to the wall and spin it around to remove the bin (if you use a bin) now and then (easy to do, just FYI). Has no top handle only side handles, the others have top and side handles. If it ever goes up steps you will likely wish it had the top handle. All: All of them had easy to remove and place bins with good handles and were tough to spill unless not paying attention (I've read a review saying LG was bad for spilling the bin, though I didn't find it difficult, but I thought I should mention it FYI). They all have wheels. I often don't get no-fault replacement warranties, but I would definitely get 2+ year one for these. CAN THESE REALLY HELP AFTER A FLOOD: --------------------- After a week running continuously at full fan speed the wet/damp smell from a little flood in the basement went away. GIVE ME A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OF ON-GOING UTILITY: ---------------------- To help prevent basement mold we target 50-55 RH as a cost efficient target. We found to get this we need to set the dehumidifier to a higher target value (in our case 65 RH in Winter, 60 RH in Spring), your unit will vary, see warning above about needing a separate humidity meter). Ordinarily our basement ranges from 54-59 RH or so in Winter. Depending on what we set the dehumidifier to we can target a 3-4 RH range anywhere between 38rh to 54rh (we didn't test higher) but couldn't get it lower than 38 RH with a single dehumidifier for our middle-sized basement. If we wanted to keep it down to 38-41 RH by running it continuously I measured it costs around 6x-10x more in kWh of electricity (depending on time of year), thus costing hundreds of dollars more per year, compared to keeping it in the 50-55 RH range which meets many folks basement needs.

HOW MUCH WATER I FOUND THEY CAN REALLY PULL OUT OF THE AIR IN AN HOUR AT MAX FAN SPEED: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 0.82 lbs water per hour SoleusAir: 0.69 \" LG: 0.53 \" If sheer power is your main concern, for example correcting an 18 RH humidity spike ASAP after towels go through the dryer, Frigidaire wins here. These numbers are an average of the bottom two runs out of three tests I did for each unit. Note that the first Frigidaire I tested performed poorly at 0.47 lbs of water per hour. I returned it and the new one I got 3 months later did this well which much better reflects the performance satisfaction by a leading consumer magazine. HOW COST EFFICIENT I FOUND THEY ARE TO RUN: --------------------------- Frigidaire: 645 Watt Hours electricity to remove 1 lb. of water SoleusAir: 690 \" LG: 800 \" This is not extrapolated from data sheets, this was measured. The LG will likely overall cost more to operate, the Frigidaire and SoleusAir win here. These numbers are an average of the bottom two out of three test runs for each unit. HOW MUCH TIME TO FILL THEIR BUCKET IN WINTER IN ONE EXAMPLE BASEMENT AT TOP FAN SPEED: ------------------------- Frigidaire: 0.9 days SoleusAir: 0.8 days LG: 1.2 days Remember that the bins hold different amounts of water. The full range for the Frigidaire in my tests was 0.74-0.92 days to fill its bucket. MISC. NOTES: -------------- Frigidaire: Easily the most attractive, build quality is excellent. Well reviewed by respected independent consumer magazine. Has top and side handles. Look out for cleaning filter light going on erroneously early on in order to facilitate an exchange while it is still easy to do. It is easy to spot, after going off early you would clean the filter put it back in and it would still be on. As noted above, the first Frigidaire dehumidifier I bought was performance defective and I returned it. These numbers are from testing the replacement. LG: As noted above, has pretty bad reviews on Amazon regarding durability. Vents out the back and thus requires 1' distance from a wall, the others vent upwards. So expect in some cases to have to point the front to the wall and spin it around to remove the bin (if you use a bin) now and then (easy to do, just FYI). Has no top handle only side handles, the others have top and side handles. If it ever goes up steps you will likely wish it had the top handle. All: All of them had easy to remove and place bins with good handles and were tough to spill unless not paying attention (I've read a review saying LG was bad for spilling the bin, though I didn't find it difficult, but I thought I should mention it FYI). They all have wheels. I often don't get no-fault replacement warranties, but I would definitely get 2+ year one for these. CAN THESE REALLY HELP AFTER A FLOOD: --------------------- After a week running continuously at full fan speed the wet/damp smell from a little flood in the basement went away. GIVE ME A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OF ON-GOING UTILITY: ---------------------- To help prevent basement mold we target 50-55 RH as a cost efficient target. We found to get this we need to set the dehumidifier to a higher target value (in our case 65 RH in Winter, 60 RH in Spring), your unit will vary, see warning above about needing a separate humidity meter). Ordinarily our basement ranges from 54-59 RH or so in Winter. Depending on what we set the dehumidifier to we can target a 3-4 RH range anywhere between 38rh to 54rh (we didn't test higher) but couldn't get it lower than 38 RH with a single dehumidifier for our middle-sized basement. If we wanted to keep it down to 38-41 RH by running it continuously I measured it costs around 6x-10x more in kWh of electricity (depending on time of year), thus costing hundreds of dollars more per year, compared to keeping it in the 50-55 RH range which meets many folks basement needs. Obviously your mileage will vary by time of year, geography, unit, air leakage, etc., this is just one real world example, hope it helps! HOW TO GET THE WATER RIGHT INTO A DRAIN: ------------------------ Get a 3/4\" to 1/4\" brass female HOSE FITTING ($5.50) (Home Depot 098268532173) and have someone at a hardware store attach it to a 10' 1/4\" flexible VINYL TUBE ($2.75) for you (Home Depot 048643025486) using a 1/4\" Delrin SLEEVE INSERT (Home Depot 048643070356) cut to preferred length, and put the tube right into the drain. I edged the tube along the wall behind a pipe to keep it taught, straight, and sloping. Now the cats can't drink the non-potable water as it comes out and the tube is almost invisible.", "id": 6202387011}

{"review": "I needed a dehumidifier for my basement and thought this would be a good option so I ordered it. Here is what I found: 1. Nice design. 2. Good handles to move it with. 3. Worked for 2 days without issues. Here is what I did not like: 1. After working for two days, the unit started having a puddle of water under it. Yes, I had drained the holding tank. Yes, there was some water in it, but most of the water was on the floor. No matter what I tried, water just collected on the floor. 2. A suggestion on Amazon was made to try only using the drain hose option and not the tank. Tried that and while water started collecting in the sump, water was also still going onto the floor. 3. Figuring that every product can have an issue, I tried contacting Frigidaire. No luck!!! Their website is not much help and the options that I could find was to ship it to one of their service centers at my expense! So, I wrote them a letter on their \"contact us\" link and the automated system said they would get back to me in one to two business days. That did not happen. 4. After 10 days an e-mail arrived from Frigidaire stating that they needed me to state my problem and provide information on the item I was having problems with. Oh, the e-mail was back dated 3 days from the time stamp on the e-mail!! Nice that I had given them the model number, serial number, and a description of the problem already.

{"review": "I bought this product based on the brand name, local store endorsement and amazon reviews. It worked great until about 10 days after the 1 year warranty expired. Then I started to notice water on the floor, despite my regular emptying of bucket and the fact that the bucket was not overflowing. I checked the bucket for leaks. There were none. The area underneath the bucket on one side only was consistently wet. It appears that the unit itself is leaking and allowing water to bypass the bucket opening and run down the bucket housing. I contacted the company 18 days after the one year date of purchase. I was not able to speak to a human being (that was not an option) but did get an email telling me that unfortunately, the 2-5 year warranty does not cover my problem. I paid about $250 for the unit and expected it to last longer than one year. I will not buy a Frigidaire or Electrolux product again.

{"review": "I'm just thrilled with this dehumidifier. It replaces an 10 year old Whirlpool, and provides a number of key benefits for my needs: 1. Quiet - even at full fan speed the noise level is remarkably low. You can easily have a conversation standing next to it. Unlike the Whirlpool, I can't hear it running in the basement when I'm upstairs. 2. Water container - easy to remove and pour out without any splashing or messes. I often use the water to water my plants, so being able to carry and pour the container without drips is wonderful! Although I don't use it with a drain, it comes with a drain connector so it can discharge the water into a floor drain or sump if you don't want the water to collect in the bin. 3. Space conservation - the air intake is on the front and the outlet is on the top, so I can position the unit to be flush against the wall. Takes up far less room than units with the fan outlet on the back. While this is tall, it sticks out only about a foot from the wall. It rolls easily over hard surfaces and low-pile carpet. 4. Controls - I love that I can set the unit to a specific humidity level rather than guess with a dial-type humistat. It cycles off when it hits the set level, and cycles back on when the humidity creeps up. 5. Filter - it has a washable mesh filter that is easy to remove and clean. Since I have cats (and the unit is in the basement which is dusty to begin with) that will save me from having to clean the coils as much as I have had to do with the Whirlpool to remove dust and cat hair. 6.

{"review": "I'm just thrilled with this dehumidifier. It replaces an 10 year old Whirlpool, and provides a number of key benefits for my needs: 1. Quiet - even at full fan speed the noise level is remarkably low. You can easily have a conversation standing next to it. Unlike the Whirlpool, I can't hear it running in the basement when I'm upstairs. 2. Water container - easy to remove and pour out without any splashing or messes. I often use the water to water my plants, so being able to carry and pour the container without drips is wonderful! Although I don't use it with a drain, it comes with a drain connector so it can discharge the water into a floor drain or sump if you don't want the water to collect in the bin. 3. Space conservation - the air intake is on the front and the outlet is on the top, so I can position the unit to be flush against the wall. Takes up far less room than units with the fan outlet on the back. While this is tall, it sticks out only about a foot from the wall. It rolls easily over hard surfaces and low-pile carpet. 4. Controls - I love that I can set the unit to a specific humidity level rather than guess with a dial-type humistat. It cycles off when it hits the set level, and cycles back on when the humidity creeps up. 5. Filter - it has a washable mesh filter that is easy to remove and clean. Since I have cats (and the unit is in the basement which is dusty to begin with) that will save me from having to clean the coils as much as I have had to do with the Whirlpool to remove dust and cat hair. 6.

{"review": "I just assembled and used this vaccuum for the 1st time, lastnight (ie: April 5, 2013). For one thing, I Loved how easy it was to assemble! Basically, stuff just pops into the sockets where they belong. You will only need a philips screwdriver to tighten 2 screws on the handle (which are included). Besides that, I think the cord is a very nice length! Granted, I live in an 880-sq.ft apartment, so there isn't a whole lot of ground to cover, but I only had to unplug it once in order to reach all areas of my apartment. Besides that, my girlfriend & I were amazed to see just how much dirt & stuff this thing picked up!!!!! This vacuum does make a fair amount of noise, but that's because it has a sweet motor which obviously does exactly what a GOOD vaccuum is expected to do! Finally, it was so easy to remove the \"dirt canister\", empty it & put it back in place! Also, it has a dial on the front which adjusts the vacuum's height, and the machine is very easy to manuever. I love it, so far! I will follow up here if this vaccuum malfunctions in time, but for now, I'm highly impressed! ***UPDATE*** Today is May 29, 2013. I've owned this vacuum almost 2 months and have used it once per week to clean my apartment. I have NO complaints so far. It's still going strong, and I really like how the canister is so easy to dump out & replace. I'll be sure to post here again if/when this thing lets me down. ***UPDATE*** Today is December 15, 2013. It's still working great, and I still love it. No complaints! :) ***UPDATE*** Today is June 18, 2014. It's been about 14 months now and I continue to use this vaccuum frequently. NO complaints. It still operates as expected, and Very easy to use. I'm extremely pleased! NOTE: I learned a very important lesson!! I recently began using a powder deodorizer on my carpet (the last 3 times I've cleaned), and I noticed that the vacuum's base area (motor?) was getting unusually warm. Of course I became concerned so I called a local vacuum repair shop just to ask if this sounded typical. The shop worker immediately told me that using any powder product with a vacuum is THE WORSE thing you can do! The powder is so fine, it gets into the vac's motor and will eventually causes it to overheat! Using these kind of powder products, kills vacuums! I immediately discontinued using the deodorizer, and so far, my vacuum seems fine. So, beware.....NO powder deodorizers! :)", "id": 510110}

{"review": "I am a vacuum cleaner guru and 'snob'. I've owned about 20 different 'bagless' models in the past 15 years, and am always happy to review the great ones, in order to 'get the word out'. If you want an excellent, everyday bagless vac without breaking the bank, this is it! This 'CleanView OnePass' model has excellent suction (you can feel the suction) and edge pickup abilities, carpet and hard floor performance, and is not as loud as other vacs. The dirt bin is a good size that holds a lot of dirt, and it is easy to empty and snap back onto the machine. I use 2 main vacs in my house, which are my current favorites. The Bissell and my Shark 'Navigator NV22L'. I've had my Shark almost 2 years now, but the hose that connects into the sweeper base cracked, and I cannot find a replacement, so I used duct tape to seal it as best I can. I was going to purchase yet another Shark, but I don't like the somewhat narrow path compared to the wider Bissell, and i'm afraid the hose will crack again prematurely. It takes me much less time to vacuum with the Bissell. Also, the Bissell has manual height adjustment settings, which is always a good feature. The Bissell also cost half of what the Shark Navigator does. In summation, you cannot do better for about 70 dollars! 4.5 stars. 5/23/13 update: It is now one day after I wrote this review, and I wanted to tell everyone about a simple mod (modification) I did to this vac to make it perform even better! There is always a bit of leakage in vacuum hose assemblies that robs a vac of some of it's suction, so I applied some white 'DAP Alex Plus Easy Caulk' around the hose where the flexible part meets the connectors to completely seal the slight gap that exists. I gave it a day to dry and cure, and I noticed an increase in suction power! What was once an already excellent vac, with excellent suction, is now a MONSTER! I would not be surprised if suction increased on the order of 10 to 20 percent!", "id": 510110}

{"review": "I bought this vac for my wife on March 23rd, 2013 and today (about 4 1/2 months later) it goes to the trash can. It worked well until about a month ago when it started going through belts. Today, my wife told me it had been smoking when she used it (I thought it's too young to be smoking). Being an engineer, I took this as a challenge and decided it was time to get to the bottom of it. I ran the vac with the bottom cover removed and observed that the belt migrates over to the end of the motor shaft and begins rubbing on the metal rub plate. I wondered why the belt moves off the center of the motor shaft. A close look revealed that the motor shaft is no longer parallel to the beater brush. I suspected something had slipped out of place inside the motor housing so I unplugged it and took it apart to see if I could fix it. As I was taking it apart I noticed that the plastic housing surrounding the motor shaft was deformed from excessive heating. In fact, after about fifteen minutes of disassembly time, the motor was still too hot to touch. At that point I realized there was no fixing this. They've taken too much cost out of the motor (not enough iron and copper) which makes the motor run too hot which in turn softens the plastic housing causing it to deform. It's a shame, if they had spent about five bucks more on the motor it would have lasted for years.", "id": 510110}

{"review": "I bought this vacuum as a secondary machine for light duty in some rooms. Our primary vacuum is a 6-year-old Dyson that is still working like a champ. For what this vacuum is... it's a great deal. I'm not sure if you can find a better machine on the market for 80 bucks or less. Its cyclone is very rudimentary, but it does have decent suction and vacuums almost as well as our Dyson. The attachments are decent for a vacuum that costs less than a hundred bucks and its overall design and build quality is impressive for a machine in its class. Bissell has really stepped up their game with these newer machines. Some nit-picks I have about it: - Although the pre-motor filter is washable and \"doesn't need replacement\" according to Bissell, I would be surprised if it lasts for over a year before needing to be replaced. It is made from cheap single density foam and I've noticed that it traps dirt into the foam fibers even after washing it. Also, given the rudimentary nature of the cyclone, roughly half of the fine particle dust ends up right in the filter, slowing the suction down. So if you live in a dusty home, or have pets, you will be cleaning and washing the filter every single time you empty the canister… which I am resorted to doing. - Bissell chose to use stickers on the vacuum which leave behind glue residue when you remove them. This is a colossal fail in my opinion and lowers the overall quality of the vacuum. - The “One Pass” technology is just marketing drivel, let’s just call it what it is. There is nothing special about the design of the brush bar on this vacuum. - Although not surprising in this price range, and I don’t think Bissell claims that it has it anyway, but this vacuum does not have a sealed HEPA cycle. This means that although it has a HEPA filter, it is possible for fine dust particles and allergens to escape the filter through gaps in the vacuum itself, or in the seal of the HEPA filter. It seems to do an OK job filtering particles, but I can still smell dust when I use it.", "id": 510110}

{"review": "If you are looking for a great vacuum to get the dirty job done quickly and still stay within a budget, then the BISSELL CleanView with One Pass Technology is for you! It is quite comparable to much higher priced Vacuums in the quality of cleaning. It just has a few design flaws that could be altered to make this vacuum more user friendly; Thus the 4 stars. PROS: - Very easy assembly. No Husband required! Had it assembled in less than 15 minutes. That includes pulling it all out of the box. - Bagless! love this feature! No changing of bags - Washable Filters! N0 need to replace a lot of parts weekly/monthly/etc. - All accessories easily dock on the vacuum! No extra storage space required. - This vacuum is much quieter than any other vacuum I've ever used. Not whisper quiet, but a lot more than other vacuums. - Moves very easily across all levels of carpet thickness. I don't feel like I have to put much effort into pushing it across the floor at all. - It is very lightweight and easy to carry up and down flights of stairs - Easy to adjust height level of brush for thicker or thinner carpets - Handles Cat/Pet hair very well! Easily picks up and removes cat hair from the cat bed, carpet floor, and furniture. - The Turbo Brush is well powered and does a very good job cleaning up little spills. - Cleans up more in one pass than any other vacuum I've used. I crumbled a lot of Ritz crackers onto the floor and pushed then into the carpet a bit just to see how well it worked. In one pass over, you couldn't see any crackers left behind! This definitely saves me time cleaning! CONS: - I wish this vacuum had a better cord winding system. I am just silly and hate winding up the cord after every time I vacuum. I'd love a fast auto-winding feature. So I was sad to see this model doesn't have that. - The Hose can actually extend up to 6 feet. Now this could just be because my vacuum is still so new, but it doesn't like to extend well without pulling the entire vacuum unit over. I have to have someone hold the vacuum in place while I pull on the hose to reach the crevices or do the stairs. - The actual vacuum unit tips over far too easily when using the hose. I can see this issue becoming less prevalent as I use the vacuum more and stretch out the hose, but I don't see it going away completely even after a lot of use. - Power switch is not in a user friendly location. The power switch is on the side of the vacuum and you have to bend over to reach, instead of a simple push with the foot with other power foot buttons at the bottom. - The power chord seems a little short. I have to constantly stop, unplug and move the cord to a new outlet so I can keep vacuuming through my house. It's about just 2 feet short of what I would prefer. I can almost do my entire living room and hallway; but I just barely pull short of the end of the hallway, so I have to move the plug to finish off. Overall: Even with the few cons, I am still in love with my BISSELL! And it is still light years ahead of my old vacuum! And really you can't beat the price for the quality of clean you are getting. I couldn't be happier to have a quality vacuum that really cuts down on the time spent vacuuming, so I can spend it on more important things like my kids, reading, cooking dinner, or just taking that 10 minutes to catch some special \"me\" time! BISSELL's CleanView Vacuum with OnePass Technology speeds up the monotonous chore of vacuuming so you can spend more time doing things you love and spend less time cleaning.

{"review": "If you're considering this vacuum, look at the tendencies in the ratings. The positive ones tend to be written immediately after the vacuum arrives. And yes, the first 3-4 months you use this vacuum you will probably be impressed, given the price. However, it is incredibly cheaply made and will disappoint quickly. My problem with it is that the belt slips almost off almost immediately after I put it back on. I disassembled the machine and found that there is absolutely nothing holding the belt on to the rod upon which it fits. That could have been solved in the engineering literally for 50 cents. It appears that I'll be needing to replace the belt every couple of months, maybe a belt with maximum tension might not fall off so quickly, but I'm not hopeful.", "id": 510110}

{"review": "I bought this vacuum in desperation as we were moving out of a house we were selling and our older vacuum gave out. I ran to a local store that only had small, inexpensive vacuums, and grabbed this one. It worked fine for a very short amount of time. Now, a couple of months later, it's going in the garbage. The brush quit working, and I thought the belt must have broken---strange that would happen so soon, but an easy enough fix. Upon removing the bottom cover, I discovered that the belt was NOT broken, but had slipped off the metal rod from the motor. I put it back on, and went back to vacuuming. Not 30 seconds later, it was off again. So, to vacuum my house, I go through the process of vacuuming for 30 seconds, put the vacuum on a table, remove all 7 screws, put the belt back on, replace all 7 screws, vacuum for 30 seconds, etc. When the belt is on (for 30 seconds at a time) it works quite well. But, I don't have the time or patience for this process of replacing the belt every 30 seconds. Ridiculous. This is an obvious design flaw. Do not purchase this machine!", "id": 510110}

{"review": "Late last year I bought a fancy Samsung refrigerator - the model RF4289HARS. It is the one with the 4 doors (actually two French doors on top, a middle drawer, and a bottom freezer drawer. It has the water and ice dispenser on the left French door just under the snazzy blue led lighted touch control panel. Anyway, the change filter light came on and so I removed the filter (it is really easy, just unscrew it a half turn and it comes right out) so I could see what the replacement part number on it said. It was DA-29-00020A. After looking around the internet, and looking on the Samsung website I found that there is no such part number - the closest thing I found was almost the same number only ending with B instead of A. I called Samsung and after getting bounced to 3 different customer service people who had no idea whether part DA-29-00020A was the correct replacement for part DA-29-00020B and one customer service person who did not know that the filters are supposed to be changed after a while, I found a person who was able to tell me that DA-29-00020B is in fact the correct replacement filter for refrigerator model RF4289HARS. I bought two of these filters - one to install now and one for a spare. I put one in (it takes about 5 seconds to insert it and give it a half twist to the right to install it, and then I followed the instructions of running about a gallon of water through it. You really do need to run this amount of water through it so get all of the air out of it so you get a smooth stream of filered water coming out. I then reset the change filter light - you have to do this manually but all it takes is pressing and holding for 5 seconds (not the 3 seconds they tell you) the child lock/filter reset spot on the bottom left corner of the touch control screen just above the water/ice dispenser. It works great now - tasty filtered water and flavorless crushed ice from my fancy refrigerator any time I want it.", "id": 1294452011}

{"review": "For those complaining about the price and short time between filter changes, I too had the same concerns until research turned up this info from Samsung. The filter replacement isn't required unless you notice a decrease in water flow or ice production. I have followed this guide and now change my filter about every 15-18 months with no changes in water taste or ice clarity. Talk about saving a mint, I used to change it religiously at 6 months. [...] Hope this helps and no you do not need to turn off the water supply to change the filter, just a towel to wipe up the approx. 2-3 tbls. of water that comes out from removing the old filter, but that happens whether you turn off the supply or not.", "id": 1294452011}

{"review": "I recently bought this to sharpen all of my kitchen knives which had gone dull over the years. At first, I didn't think it worked too well. But then I went to the Edgeware website and watched their YouTube video on how to use it, and realized that you may have to pull the knife throught the sharpener up to 10 times to get it sharp. (I was initially only pulling it through a couple times.) After pulling through the knives about 5 times, the knives did indeed get very sharp. For my knives, I pulled them through the \"course\" side 5-6 times, then through the \"fine\" side about 4 times. Seemed to work well for me. Another tip I learned by watching Edgeware's YouTube video, was to set the sharpener on the edge of the counter at a 45 degree angle. (That's apparently what the v-shaped groove is for on the bottom of the sharpener.) When the sharpener is on the edge, you can pull the knives straight through and down without worrying about hitting the countertop and scratching it or breaking the tip off your knife. Lastly, I'm not sure why some reviewers say that this only works on small knives. I used it on small knives, as well as all of my larger chef style knives. The process is exactly the same no matter the size of the knife. So it should work the same, and indeed it worked just fine on all of my small and large knives.", "id": 289867}

{"review": "I bought this specifically for some inexpensive \"Farberware Pro\" knives, for which it matched the factory bevel very well. I have not tried it with any other knives, but I imagine Farberware's grind is fairly typical of most kitchen knives being sold today. This sharpener is not comparable to a stone or similar systems when faced with varied or more complex grinds, and is not going anywhere near the cleaver, for example. However, the carbide bits are very aggressive, much better than typical \"coarse\" ceramic sharpeners, and could probably regrind a knife fairly quickly. The \"fine\" ceramic rods are standard fare. The grip looked small in the picture but, combined with the traction from the rubber bottom, proved comfortable and completely secure. Of the fixed angle, countertop sharpeners I have encountered, this is the best designed and I expect to replace it with same model when it wears out.", "id": 289867}

It never seemed to get them as sharp as I hoped and not to mention it seemed to take a special skill to sharpen the knives without taking too much of the blade and to sharpen at the right angle so as I make things even. I always worried I was doing things wrong or taking too much metal off my knife. This does succeed in making knife sharpening easy. I like that it guides the knife through so there is less guesswork about angles. But I do worry at times that it is still taking too much off my knife and that I might be better off getting them professionally sharpened.

The less powerful part is OK, I can just turn the speed up on it (I always used the first setting on the HT-800--that sucker was strong!l). The part they really screwed up, though, is the base. They inexplicably cut away parts of it in the front and the back so now, instead of being solid and sturdy feeling, it's flimsy feeling and top heavy and falls over or points upward every time you touch it. Why oh why do so many companies take a product that's fantastic just the way it is and then change it so it sucks? By the way, I put this same review on the manufacturer's website (Kaz) and noticed that they change all customer reviews to 5 stars, no matter how many you choose. Real honest of them.

The less powerful part is OK, I can just turn the speed up on it (I always used the first setting on the HT-800--that sucker was strong!l). The part they really screwed up, though, is the base. They inexplicably cut away parts of it in the front and the back so now, instead of being solid and sturdy feeling, it's flimsy feeling and top heavy and falls over or points upward every time you touch it. Why oh why do so many companies take a product that's fantastic just the way it is and then change it so it sucks? By the way, I put this same review on the manufacturer's website (Kaz) and noticed that they change all customer reviews to 5 stars, no matter how many you choose. Real honest of them. After years of buying this brand, I guess I'll be looking for a different one the next time I need a new fan.", "id": 13900821}

{"review": "Are you in the market for a $16 smallish fan? Then you are probably trying to decide between the Honeywell Chillout and the Honeywell TurboForce. I have both and like both, but both are suited for slightly different settings. In a nutshell, the Chillout pushes less air but has quieter operation (and a more pleasing tone, but that is subjective); and, the Honeywell has more options (tilt, 3 speed settings) and a more stable base (and as you can guess pushes more air with it's larger fan blades and is louder). So in the end you need to decide which fan will work better for you. Air Flow: Winner = Tie - (+1 Honeywell) Based upon my observations the Honeywell low setting produces airflow in between the low and high setting on the Chillout. The medium setting on the Honeywell gives more airflow than the high setting on the Chillout. The high setting on the Honeywell give more airflow than can be achieved by the Chillout. - (+1 Chillout) As a consequence of this, however, the Chillout allows you to have a truly low setting for those instances you just want a touch of airflow. The Honeywell is still pretty powerful at its lowest setting. For us, this comes in handy in our daughter's room. This way our baby monitor (audio only) is not overpowered by the strong gust/sound from the Honeywell. Now my daughter is allowed to use a fan overnight - with the Honeywell, we would shut it off before going to bed. Sound: Winner = Chillout - Chillout: 80 decibels (dB) directly in front of the fan, 70 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 45 dB about three feet to the side of the fan. - Honeywell: 80 dB directly in front of the fan, 75 dB about three feet in front of the fan, 50 dB about three feet to the side of the fan. - As I mentioned above, I fell the tone of the sound from the Chillout is closer to white noise, whereas the Honeywell motor overpowers the sound and is higher pitched. The Honeywell sound is not annoying, just louder and less pleasing (for those that like white noise). Stability: Winner = Honeywell - The Honeywell has a solid base that allows uniform distribution of weight across the entire base. It sits well in window sills with extended platforms in front. - The Chillout has a pair of feet in the front that is connected by a cross bar. The back is a fin similar to the front feet, but pointing backwards. The depth of the Chillout is slightly less than the Honeywell. I thought this might add to stability when used in a window sill or the platform in front of a window if you have one; however, I did not find this to be the case. I found that with the feet design, the Chillout has a more concentrated distribution of weight and therefore has a tendency to slip and fall to the side when used in situations that are not perfectly stable. - Case in point - our windows have platforms that sit in front of the window. They run about four and a half inches wide. The Honeywell sits on these with not problem despite extending about an inch or so beyond the platform. The Chillout, despite being only about a half inch beyond the platform, want to fall forward and off the platform because of the shape and position of the front feet and lack of other contact points. We have to use something underneath the fan to extend the effective platform width to keep the fan in place. This review is re-posted as a Chillout review.", "id": 3737601}

{"review": "I purchased this fan knowing that other reviewers had a problem with the pivoting fan head holding the selected position. I hoped that this condition had either been fixed, as it is a Honeywell, or it was not as bad as indicated by other reviewers. It has not been fixed and it is every bit as bad as indicated by others. Additionally, as I had the fan on a GFI outlet, I found that, when opeating the ON/OFF fan speed switch from one position to another, it opened the GFI outlet shutting off the fan. The fan has been returned to Amazon.", "id": 3737601}

{"review": "I am very impressed with this extra small desk sized fan. It creates a nice strong breeze that can be felt from several feet away. Even the lowest setting creates quite a breeze, so if you have papers around or need an extra quiet fan this is probably not a good choice. For me though, I like the white noise it creates and in the hot, humid Florida summers, this is a nice way to cool off without having astronomical power bills. I purchased one fan for each of the bedrooms and can now raise the temp on my A/C by two degrees and yet it feels cooler than it did before. The fan can also be wall-mounted and the fan's angle clicks into secure settings so you don't have to worry about it rotating up or down. The power cord appears to be around six feet long. I highly recommend these little fans for portability, space, and effectiveness. Those wanting an oscillating fan rather than a fan that only blows in one direction should consider Honeywell HFT114B Oscillating Super-Turbo High-Performance 3-Speed Fan.", "id": 3737601}

{"review": "I was looking for the 5 mil, but couldn't find them. These 3 mil pouches are pretty thick though. I've used almost half of my pack and there has been no bubbles or burning. I've not needed to run them thru a second time, either. Like others, I wish I could order larger quantities at a discount, but the product is great! I've made workbox grids for school and a chore chart and added velcro dots and the laminated pieces have held up very nicely to little 5 year old hands!", "id": 6361272011}

{"review": "I purchased both the laminating machine and pouches of various sizes for my mother this Christmas. She is a laminating junkie and laminates just about everything she can including pictures, proof of insurance certificates, newspaper clippings, recipe cards and even recipes pulled from magazines. Its important to note that my mother is about as anti tech as one can possibly get. It took me a couple years just to get her operating a Mac laptop efficiently. When it comes to technology, she finds even the simplest of things difficult, lol. Anyways, she figured out how to operate the laminating machine in just a few minutes. That's how simple it is to use this system. The pouches are fantastic as they make aligning of the item super easy. You just pop the item into the pouch and send it through the laminating machine and your all set. The quality is absolutely perfect. No air bubbles and no creases, just a perfectly laminated item. Considering how cheap the laminating machine is, something like this is a no-brainer for people like my mother. The pouches run anywhere from 20 to 33 cents each depending on size. Bottom line - This system is extremely affordable and about as easy as something can be to operate. The lamination of important documents is just a smart idea and with a system as easy and affordable as this.....well there is really no reason not to. Highly recommended. 5 stars!", "id": 6361272011}

{"review": "I bought these pouches to use with my 3M laminating machine. I am an elementary teacher and I am actually quite conservative with the huge laminate because there is so much plastic waste. These are perfect. I used learning activities printed on card stock and ran them through the machine. I'd say I ran about 40 sheets in about 30 minutes. By the time the back is done, the front is cooled down enough to touch it which is great. I printed my activities on \"economy mode\" to save ink and these laminating pouches actually made the text look BRIGHTER which is just a bonus. I love that when I laminate a 8.5x11 paper, I don't even have to trim the edges if I don't want to. It makes the paper look like a big card. They are very sturdy and durable (moreso I would say than the expensive \"school\" laminate we get).", "id": 6361272011}

{"review": "This 3-hole puncher gets the job done for light hole punching needs and for the price, it's a great value. With most 3-hole punchers, you can adjust the placement of the holes by \"sliding\" the punchers at your desired customized location. This one, however, provides fixed spots where you can't slide the punchers but must use one of the predefined holes. But I think this works better because you won't encounter the unwanted situation of a puncher moving to an incorrect location as is common among the slide-able punchers. Plus, how often do you use a 3-hole puncher for other than the standard 3 hole positions you find in a 3-ring binder? Also, this 3-hole puncher is very sturdy as the important parts are made out of metal and should last for a long time. The only complaint and the reason why I won't rate this 5-stars is that the punched holes are a bit closer to the edge of the paper than ideally desired. I measured the distance between the edge of the paper and where the hole starts to equal 5 to 6 milimeters (a little less than 1/4 inch).", "id": 2373792011}
{"review": "This 3-hole puncher gets the job done for light hole punching needs and for the price, it's a great value. With most 3-hole punchers, you can adjust the placement of the holes by \"sliding\" the punchers at your desired customized location. This one, however, provides fixed spots where you can't slide the punchers but must use one of the predefined holes. But I think this works better because you won't encounter the unwanted situation of a puncher moving to an incorrect location as is common among the slide-able punchers.

{"review": "I've owned some tough to use paper punches. This Swingline Pro paper punch is so nice. It's the best paper punch I've ever owned. Operation is smooth. At 10 pages (its maximum capacity), I have to work a little more to slide the paper in. I can feel a little more force is needed to punch, but just putting my weight on it works. It's not a struggle. Smaller stacks of paper (about six pages) will punch without any effort at all. The chip tray keeps everything neat. It slides open for a quick dump over the wastepaper basket. I don't have confetti flying everywhere. The punch heads are replaceable and they can be moved into a variety of positions. I can even turn it into a two-hole punch or a one-hole punch. Moving or removing the punch heads requires the use of a screwdriver, so it's not something I'd want to do constantly; but it's not difficult to do. This paper punch is sturdy, attractive, compact, does what I need it to do with ease. I love it.", "id": 2373792011}

After years of hole-punching for scripts (3-holes on the side) and legal docs (2 holes at top), now most work has switched to electronic \"paper.\" But sometimes when real paper is still required,a puncher comes in handy. I got this when I suddenly had to replace a reliable old solid metal 3-hole punch that finally wore out (after 30 years!) PROS: --Heavy enough to not slide around while punching. Not flimsy. --Easily punches about 5-8 pieces of paper at a time. --Price. $8 is a bargain...if it works. CONS: --Not easy to adjust. You have to unscrew and move the 3 screws on the bottom. I think they're plastic so if they break? that's it for the puncher. --Holes a bit close to the edge of the paper, and there is no way to adjust that. --Just partial metal construction - so far so good, but the rubbery plastic tray might get loose after a lot of use, and if just one of those screws breaks, then the whole puncher [haha, little pun there ;-p] won't work.", "id": 2373792011}

{"review": "Who knew? I've been getting by with very cheap manual pencil sharpeners for years, and finally decided, after I'd invested in some Prismacolor pencils, to invest in a better sharpener. HUGE difference. Like night and day difference. It takes very little effort to shave a pencil with this -- no forcing the pencil into the sharpener, just gentle twisting a few turns and you're done. I've used it on my cheaper pencils, standard No. 2 pencils, and my Prismacolor pencils, and it works equally well on all. VERY happy with this.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "I haven't had any issues with the Prismacolor pencils breaking while using this pencil sharpener. It does a perfectly fine job for an incredibly cheap price. I would recommend using this one.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "I recently bought a Prismacolor pencil sharpener from Amazon and was initially a bit worried if I overpaid for a manual sharpener. Afterall, the description for this product says it's a \"colored pencil sharpener\" which is somewhat absurd being that any sharpener should be able to sharpen a colored pencil. Here's my take on the product. First off, it's a lot smaller than I thought. I was expecting something possibly 4-6 inches, but this sharpener is really small; barely over 2 inches if that. But here's the good news. It sharpens a pencil to a really good point. I actually bought some Mirado black warriors, an art kit with HB pencils and such and my art kit came with a terrible little sharpener. Thank god for the prismacolor. It doesn't even take long to sharpen a pencil to a fine point and I haven't had any issues with breakage. Another good tip you may want to know about is that instead of rotating your pencil to sharpen it, hold the pencil firmly in the sharpener and rotate the sharpener instead. You'll get good results every time. I highly recommend this sharpener being that it's the best manual sharpener you can get for the price.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "We go through a lot of pencil sharpeners, even the expensive electric ones. Our best sharpener is an old fashioned school sharpener that suction cups to the table, but as far as portable sharpeners (we homeschool and we draw a lot), this one is great. It doesn't oversharpen our expensive colored pencils either.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "Easy to use, compact and best of all, makes a nice long point on colored pencils. Some others kind of chew them up, but this works nicely. Best of all, it is inexpensive and small.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "I got this sharpener in a timely manner. The problem with it is that it brakes the pencil tip over and over again. It was such a waste of money. I can't believe prismacolor put their name on it. I know it wasn't my pencils that were the problem, because I used another sharpener, which worked great. That sharpener came with a drawing kit that I had bought. I'd skip purchasing this one if I were you.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "This sharpens pencils better than other manual pencil sharpeners that I have and I use it for art pencils. It's easier for me to use with my arthritic hands, too.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "I have been on a long quest to find a sharpener, manual or electric that actually works. This does a very decent job of sharpening without breaking the point.", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "I bought it and it came good and fast! But I sharpened a pencil once and pulled it out and it had been COMPLETLY cut up! Then I thought maybe a color pencil and it broke off the tip every time!! Overall if you want a sharpener don't get this one", "id": 1069806}
{"review": "After such great reviews, I decided to buy this sharpener. Bad idea- please don't waste your money and do as I did.

{"review": "First off, I'd like to say I was very pleased to see that the markers came in the mail as shown in the picture. Anyways, as for the title, I noticed that none of the reviews or the page itself stated what colors came in this 24-pack, that colored sharpie in the top row second from the left is what I believed to be Indigo, it's actually Navy. Anyways, here are the colors as named by Sharpie: Slate Grey Navy Sky Blue Turquoise Lime Green Mint Yellow Peach Orange Pink Lemonade Magenta, I believe Berry Boysenberry Purple Brown Jellie Pink Leg Warmer Orange Valley Girl Violet Banana Clip Yellow Argyle Green Black Blue Green Red Although it didn't have Indigo, I'm not going to let that affect my review.

{"review": "I actually purchased these markers as an experiment. A housekeeper I had used to clean my home, in lifting a bag out of the bathroom pail, accidently got a piece of tape stuck to the wallpaper on the wall. Of course, in peeling the tape off the wall, it took a piece of the wallpaper, size of a nickel along with it. I was heartbroken as I recently retired to this lovely home and inherited the trimmings. As I couldn't replace the wallpaper, I thought that I might be able to use these 'permanent markers' to draw in the piece of stem and leaf that was torn off the wall. I practiced first with dipping the markers into water and drawing the leaf. It came out well and then I used the same process and drew directly onto the wallpaper. I was so proud because it worked so well and the tear is not al all noticeable. I also watercolor paint and use the markers to enhance my paintings. I enjoy them!", "id": 12897411}
{"review": "I have been a quilter and seamstress for several dozen years and I have used a large number of scissors including some very expensive ones. I am very impressed with Scotch scissors. The scissors are very sharp and make a pleasant crunch as the cut. They are comfortable to hold. I like that the handles of the three scissors in this set have different colors, so I can color code their use. I will use one for fabrics (I do a lot of fiber arts and this is my primary use for the scissors), one for paper projects (paper dulls scissors faster than fabric), and one for cutting shipping tape (the glue from the tape sticks to the blades so eventually they stop cutting well). The scissor blades are made out of titanium and look black (rather than silver like stainless steel scissors). I am attaching four images that I will be referencing in this review. Photo#1: The scissors came carefully packaged and separated from each other in shipping. Photo#2: The handle of the scissors is made of out soft plastic and is comfortable to use. The scissors are made for a right-handed person. Photo#3: The openings in the handle of the scissors is over sized. In the third photo I show Scotch scissors next to similar-sized Fons and Porter scissors and Fiscars scissors. You can see that the opening of the Scotch scissors is bigger. The material of the handles is softer than the other two. So I found them very comfortable to use for a long time. Photo#4: Shows Scotch scissors on the postal scale, they weigh in at 2.9 oz. They are heavy enough to do heavy duty cutting, yet not too heavy for me to get tired while using them. Overall, the scissors over-exceeded my expectations given that I payed significantly more for other scissors which don't perform any better than the scissors in this set. I recommend them!

The blades are made of titanium and they open smooth and easily without sticking. They are very well made, and solid. I was looking for new scissors since my trusty pair has gotten very dull. They cut well, and smooth. I cut paper, thin cardboard and plastic and they cut right through all of it with ease. I am pleased with these. I shouldn't need another pair for many years. Added 11/8/11: These are very sharp scissors, and I knew this, but I nicked my pinky finger with them tonight, and it bled instantly. That being said, these are not for children as I just barely touched my finger with the side of the blade. I'm not complaining, I just need to be more careful.

The ergonomics are really quite similar to most scissors I have used past middle school, and the use of titanium as a marketing ploy is way over the top.

If you need three pair of scissors, a price of less than twenty dollars is quite reasonable. I don't regret the purchase and rate this item a solid four stars out of five.", "id": 6361272011}

{"review": "While I must admit that having a really great pair of scissors has never been all that high on my list of priorities, these scissors leave me about as happy as I ever thought a pair of scissors could. They are long, which means they can cut through thick materials without me really needing to squeeze the handles. They are sharp, but not so much so that they pose a safety risk; or at least, I don't expect they could. It should go without saying, of course, that they are for adults only, and should be kept out of reach of children. They're slightly stiffer than I might have liked, but this does not seriously impair their usability. The padding on the insides of the handles is nice, making the scissors more comfortable to use. They're too thick and wide for anything that requires real precision cutting, but then, that's really not what anyone would use them for anyway. Having three pairs is great, as I live in a house that had been down to two dull pairs, so I was always running to the other side of the house when I needed something cut. Now they're spaced out strategically. I just got them recently so I can't evaluate the claims of longevity, but I do know titanium holds up very well to long-term use.

The peeve I have about Sakura Micron is that the tip of the .005 is a bit fragile and liable to bend, but considering how tiny it is, you sort of expect that.

{"review": "I have used these pens for fifteen years, which tells you something right there. They do not have the durability of a refillable pen set, but I find the disposability a convenience. If something happens to them, I don't have to feel bad, and I never have to refill them. Their primary good feature is the ink, which is very dark, covers well, does not bleed through paper, and is waterproof and archival-quality . . . for real. It is an extremely high-quality ink, and that's why I keep buying them. I have found no better disposable pen in fifteen years. The ink flow is moderate, neither too slow nor too free. They are well-suited for both outlining and for a more scratchy cross-hatching/scumbling approach, as they aren't so free-flowing that ink will wick out of them at the slightest touch of pen to paper. Put the tip down, leave it, that's about the size of the dot you get. The ink dries quickly and does not easily smear, although on very smooth paper that absorbs slower, execute care. As they run out of ink, they flow less easily, which can be frustrating. I draw in spurts, off and on, and have found that, unused, the pens will reliably last about a year if carefully stored (i.e., make sure the cap is on, it's not hot in the room, etc.). When using several sizes at once, cap them between use. The ink dries quickly on paper, which is great, but it also dries quickly in the tips. You can get them going again by writing a bit, but it's better to just take care. They write and draw well on most regular drawing papers, but not so well on photo papers or papers with any sort of plastic or super-slick finish; for those jobs, there are Micron pens specifically for photo paper. They aren't Sharpies, and don't write on things besides paper. The pen tips are not metal, but they are hard; they give a consistent line, and while there is some give, you will not get a terribly sensitive line out of them, and trying to do so will result in either bent nibs or metal nib housings (this can be a problem if you have a heavy hand, especially with the smaller sizes) or pen tips that are \"soft\" and will not draw as tight a line as before, or possibly tips that split. Overall, good pens, and would be especially good for a young artist experimenting with pen and ink.", "id": 13900811}

{"review": "I've been using these for at least 6 months, and I've waited to write a review until now so that I can give a full picture on whether they are truly as great as some people say they are. Great idea? yes, great concept and execution? That's what I'm here to answer. I use these for the pictures that hang along my stairway. I decided to hang my children's artwork along the wall with almost no space in-between the frames, so I needed a LOT of frames and a perfect hanging technique. Since I don't have a ton of money or 6 hands to get that perfect picture hanging down, I decided to use cheap picture frames and these strips to hang them. First I got a lot of frames from the dollar store and then had the kids paint the frames all different colors, then I got the Medium Picture hanging strips from 3M. After reading the reviews I decided to follow the directions EXACTLY, with one minor alteration. Since, again, I don't have a ton of money - and these are pretty expensive, I cut the Medium Strips lengthwise and got double for my money. I prepared the back of the frames using a cotton swab with alcohol (LET IT DRY)- if the frame was really smooth I used a needle to scratch up the finish figuring it would help it to adhere. Then after it dried I attached the already cut strip to the middle of frame - instead of the top because it made more sense to me. Then I took this frame and held it up to where I wanted it to hang and prepped the wall with the alcohol. After it dried, I lightly attached the second strip to the strip already on the frame by only pressing the top and bottom edge and removed the backing. I held it up to the wall and used a shish-kabob skewer to keep the strip to the wall as I removed the frame. The instructions said to let it wait an hour before hanging the frame back up. I found that an hour wasn't always sufficient (because my prep wasn't great? because I used 1/2 a strip? I don't know) However, if I let it sit overnight - SUCCESS! I've now had them hanging for months with no problems. I will press on them every once in a while to assure they don't knock off. After all, this is on a stairway and people can brush by them if they are not careful. I honestly believe that if you don't clean the area with alcohol or give it enough time to adhere - you are going to have problems like the other people on these reviews. It probably helps using lightweight frames - and the dollar store 8X10 frames are pretty light, but I have used a whole strip instead of a 1/2 strip to the heavier frames and they've worked just fine too. One other note. It took me forever to do the entire staircase because I could only prep a few at a time each day to give it enough time to adhere so I could measure the next frame correctly. So it was a lengthy process. It was all worth it though because now I can just yank off a frame and put in their newest artwork quite easily and it's one of my favorite places to walk because it looks so good, the edges are so straight and nothing wobbles or leans to one side. Another great thing to use strips for are the frames that you've nailed to the wall. These can sometimes tilt so I'll use the poster strips for them to keep them in place and let the nail hold the weight of the frame. I also use the poster strips (2 per velcro strip) to re-use the velcro strips once I've taken them off the wall. Haven't had any problems with them either. Good luck - prep and prepare to wait for a FANTASTIC finish to your framed art and photos. Don't let these other reviews throw you off!", "id": 511352}
{"review": "I needed to hang a series of seven large heavy picture frames, and they all needed to be at exactly the same height. I bought seven sets of the 'large' hanging strips because I thought it would make the hanging process easier than getting all the nails holes in precisely the correct spot, but I had my doubts that these strips would be strong enough to support my 10-pound frames. I was right about this product simplifying the hanging process -- with a few simple measurements and a level, they all went up lickety-split and easy as you please. But I was wrong to doubt their holding strength. The frames have been up for days and show no signs of falling down. I'm really impressed, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product. As a matter of fact, I'm never using traditional hanging hardware for frames ever again. All pictures in my house from this day on will be hung with Command strips.

This box comes with 4 sets, which are good for either one 16lb frame, two 8lb frames, or four 4lb frames. I used the entire box on a 16lb frame I have one week ago. No problems! We wiped with alcohol both the frame and the wall, velcroed the sets together where they were supposed to be on the frame, placed it on the wall where we wanted them without touching the wall, used an iPad app called Clinometer to check if it was straight on the wall, stuck it, unvelcroed the sets apart using a butter knife, waited 2 hours, then velcroed again.

{"review": "They're fine on smooth surfaces at regular room temperature, but you can't use them anywhere near a sunny window or heat register (everything comes crashing down), and they don't work on textured walls, even for light items. Our plaster has a sand texture. Although the package says smooth surfaces, I thought the might be fine for something light like a poster, but nope. It fell down after a few weeks. Everything was prepped with alcohol first. I'm also skeptical of the weight ratings. I wouldn't trust the more than about half. They're great for light applications like hanging signs on doors, or posting signs generally.", "id": 511352}
{"review": "These things are amazing! The first time I bought them I was nervous when I saw all the directions, but they're actually really easy to install - you just need to be willing to wait a day while they bond to the wall before you hang anything. They are extremely secure, and the velcro style lends itself to redecorating fairly easily (as long as you don't mind things in the same spots). They were nice too when I moved, all of my pictures were still ready to hang, I just needed to use a half-set of these and I was good to go! Be careful when removing them from the wall though! I was impatient while taking down the last of them during my move and I pulled them away from the wall (instead of down as instructions indicate) and ended up peeling some paint.", "id": 511352}

{"review": "I bought a set of these to hang some pictures at home. One picture fell because I left it up after attaching to the wall instead of waiting an hour to reattach (directions were vague on that point). I then followed the directions to the letter and the frame stayed up for about a week before it finished the work of destroying the frame and leaving more marks on the wall and trim. My advice? If you have a hammer at home, use it. You will have much better control over exactly when and how the frame is destroyed and how your wall gets marred up. You can create as much or as little destruction as you want.", "id": 511352}
{"review": "Yes, I did the prep correctly (rubbing alcohol and everything!) Yes, I waited the correct amount of time. No, I didn't overweight the hooks OR strips. I have now had 3 sets of the hooks and 1 set of the strips completely fail on me, to the tune of 3 drywall patches, a very banged-up print mounted on foamcore, a couple of dinged frames, one completely destroyed frame, and a huge chunk of 100+ year wooden baseboard. It's happened on drywall and plaster, on interior and exterior walls, in winter and now in summer. I'm so frustrated I could spit. THESE STUPID STRIPS ARE NOTHING BUT A RECIPE FOR MISERY. Some fail overnight. Some wait weeks or months to fail. It's not worth it. It's far easier to spackel and fix a nailhole than it is 1-2 3/4-1\" drywall paper chunks out of my walls. I'm so ticked off. I used a couple of these with some success and then ordered a ton of them from Amazon. Now they are all failing left and right.", "id": 511352}
{"review": "I'd consider these strips about as reliable or useful as my toddlers glue stick. At least it's edible. Having just moved into a new to us, very old craftsman house, we're still trying to identify where to put our furniture & pictures without damaging the lathe and plaster walls. Thought this would be a great way to hang the three new picture frames we purchased. The instructions stated to prep both surfaces, stick to the wall, wait an hour, and to use 2 strips for picture frames of upto 8lbs, easy enough to follow. Mounted the frames, went out for the morning, got back, and 2 of our 3 brand new frames are still on the floor. We never even had a chance to print photos for them. The 3rd practically let go in my hand. Sadly, they failed in two different ways. For the first frame, the glue let go from the wall, the strips are still clipped together. The second frame that fell, well the glue is still on the wall, The strips came apart. A waste of money.

{"review": "I was very hopeful that these adhesive can save me from drilling the walls, but they proved to be useless. The adhesive can be easily taken off the wall, however, it also allow pictures to fall off within weeks unless of course the pictures are ultra light, like a small canvas. Also the custom framed pictures usually have paper backing, if you should try to peel the tape off, the tape becomes useless and take the paper backing with it too. It only works with the over the counter frames that has wide edges on the back. The tape does not adhere well (or not at all) on any uneven surface, such as where backing meets the frame.

{"review": "Kudos to Amazon for being first-to-market with a cheaper alternative to the Apple branded cord. There's no reason you should not buy this cord. In fact, I personally prefer the black cord to Apple's white. Also, it works with Apple's wall plug.

{"review": "The quality of the cable is very good and will work as advertised. The problem really stems from the 'Lightning' side of the cable; simply the cable is too large for many iPhone 5 cases.

{"review": "Bought 2 of these in February, first one failed in June when it just stopped charging the phone. Upon close examination, one of the gold connection fingers on the lightning side connector was discolored black and appears to have been rubbed or flaked off the connector. By flipping the connector over, it would still charge the phone, but I was concerned the other side would do the same thing so I returned that cable under warranty in June. Now the 2nd cable is doing the same exact thing. I still have the original Apple cable that came with the phone and have not had any issue whatsoever with it. Since not many reviews are complaining about this issue, I may have just gotten a bad batch of cables. The good news is Amazon is refunding my payment for the 2nd cable, but they would not send a replacement. I guess they think I'm doing bad things to their cables!! December 2013 update: Now the wire on the lighting side is starting to Fray on one of the cables!! I am very disappointed with the quality of these cables. In the meantime the original Apple cable that came with my phone is working flawlessly. I noticed the genuine Apple cable is now only $4 more on Amazon...for my money it's a no brainer to go with the genuine cable...", "id": 15379741}

{"review": "UPDATED REVIEW: Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000mAh Battery Anker sent me the 2nd Gen Astro E4 battery to review as the original review was getting a bit dated. In summary, the 2nd Gen Astro E4 definitely improved on a few items that were problematic with original version. Even if you are not upgrading from the 1st Gen, I believe the improvements are still worth considering compared to other batteries on the market. Improvements compared to 1st Gen Astro E4: - Slimmer (But Longer) Body: While the 1st Gen Astro E4 was wide and shaped like a portable hard-drive, the 2nd Gen version is shaped like a flat glasses case (or a fancy pen case). This shape is much easier to slip into a front/rear pants pocket (albeit a loose fitting pair of pants). Both version weigh about the same. - Increased Efficiency to 86% (11200mAh Actual): As stated in the original review, no batteries ever hit their capacity but this one came fairly close. This updated version hit 11200mAh while the original version only reached 9200mAh. I was able to charge my Nexus 5 phone fully about 5 times or my Nexus 7 tablet about 3 times. This will be my go-to battery for extended trips away from an outlet. For those of you using Apple's latest iPad Air, this will charge it fully about 1.2 times. - 3A Maximum Output: With the new PowerIQ technology, either of the two USB ports can now charge to a total maximum of 3A. There is no longer a need to remember which port is the higher output port. Anker also increased the maximum to 3A for newer devices that support this amperage, which is a nice upgrade from the 2A of the 1st Gen. - Flat Side Activate Button: The activate button for the battery is now on the side of the unit and flat against the body; this allows the battery to be turned on easily without accidentally switching on the flashlight mode; the old placement was very susceptible to this issue. - White LED Flashlight: The 1st Gen Astro E4's flashlight was quite purple/blue; I'm happy to report that this has now been fixed. The white LED flashlight is quite a useful feature! - No More Adapters: The 2nd Gen simply comes with one MicroUSB cable instead of an adapter cable with multiple heads. I hated the adapters heads as they kept falling off and getting lost. This actually decreased the functionality of the cable, but it is an improvement in my book. At least now I have an extra MicroUSB cable instead of a bag of useless adapters. Compared to my original review, the only negative aspect of the new Astro E4 battery is that it still doesn't come with a USB-AC adapter; be prepared to bring your own. The 2nd Gen E4 still has auto-on/off for maximum battery usage and the four blue LED power indicator. All in all, a great high-capacity portable battery and a great update from Anker. ----------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: Anker 1st Gen Astro E4 13000mAh Battery Since Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback and review, I decided to take the Astro E4 power bank through its paces to see how it performs. I was quite pleased with the results; this is one solid external battery. Details below. The battery came in a nice-looking box along with a carrying pouch and an interchangeable-head USB cable; the cable came with three adapter heads: Micro-USB, Mini-USB, and iPhone/iPad (30-pin). The power bank itself has a smooth, black plastic shells and is quite elegant-looking with its chrome button and silver-colored frame. The unit has 4 bright, blue LED lights that reveals roughly how much battery life is left. The Astro E4 is somewhat heavy, but it is expect of a power bank of this large a capacity; the best way I could describe it is probably holding 2-3 rolls of quarters in your hand (not bad, right?). Due to its size and weight, this external battery is a perfect companion for your day-pack (messenger bag, backpack, purse, etc.) In terms of real-life performance, I ran tests using an iPad 2 and a Google LG Nexus 4, on multiple charge cycles. After charging the power bank to its fullest, I was able to get around 9200 mAh out of the the unit, which is around 71% of the stated capacity. Almost all external batteries perform below stated capacity, and some by a lot, so getting this amount of juice out of the Astro E4 is pretty decent. It is important to note that the charging devices were left on and drawing power for Wifi and cell signal; the actual capacity is probably even higher. To wrap up, here are my pros and cons: PROS: - Great design: nice size, weight, look, and feel - Large capacity: this thing will charge a powerful tablet once and a cellphone multiple times - Dual USB ports: can charge two devices at once - 2A output: one of the USB port outputs 2A which comes in really handy as most tablets and now some phones require this to get max charge speed - LED flashlight: energy-efficient LED flashlight allows the battery to double-duty as a flashlight, even when there very little charge left - One-button simplicity: seriously easy to figure out with only one button to push for turning on and charging - Auto-off: unit shuts off automatically after timed duration when it senses that there is nothing drawing power CONS: - Adapter heads: interchangeable adapter heads tend to get lost after a while, making the included USB cable useless - BYOACC: Bring-Your-Own-A/C-Adapter may cause frustration for some as one is not included - Misleading LED indicator: even on very low battery level, the unit will still show one light; showing none would be better - Purple hue to flashlight: this might be just my unit, but the flashlight has a heavy purple/blue hue to it and not as white (or bright) as expected Final verdict is a 4-star from me, which means if you're in the market for a powerful battery back, buy this thing as you probably will be hard pressed to find a better one with this quality/price balance. I reserve 5-stars for products that is perfect in my book and I love using. This one is nearly there but did leave me with some slight frustration at the misleading charging indicator, the missing A/C adapter, and the dimmer purple flashlight.", "id": 2516700011}

The unit has 4 bright, blue LED lights that reveals roughly how much battery life is left. The Astro E4 is somewhat heavy, but it is expect of a power bank of this large a capacity; the best way I could describe it is probably holding 2-3 rolls of quarters in your hand (not bad, right?). Due to its size and weight, this external battery is a perfect companion for your day-pack (messenger bag, backpack, purse, etc.) In terms of real-life performance, I ran tests using an iPad 2 and a Google LG Nexus 4, on multiple charge cycles. After charging the power bank to its fullest, I was able to get around 9200 mAh out of the the unit, which is around 71% of the stated capacity. Almost all external batteries perform below stated capacity, and some by a lot, so getting this amount of juice out of the Astro E4 is pretty decent. It is important to note that the charging devices were left on and drawing power for Wifi and cell signal; the actual capacity is probably even higher. To wrap up, here are my pros and cons: PROS: - Great design: nice size, weight, look, and feel - Large capacity: this thing will charge a powerful tablet once and a cellphone multiple times - Dual USB ports: can charge two devices at once - 2A output: one of the USB port outputs 2A which comes in really handy as most tablets and now some phones require this to get max charge speed - LED flashlight: energy-efficient LED flashlight allows the battery to double-duty as a flashlight, even when there very little charge left - One-button simplicity: seriously easy to figure out with only one button to push for turning on and charging - Auto-off: unit shuts off automatically after timed duration when it senses that there is nothing drawing power CONS: - Adapter heads: interchangeable adapter heads tend to get lost after a while, making the included USB cable useless - BYOACC: Bring-Your-Own-A/C-Adapter may cause frustration for some as one is not included - Misleading LED indicator: even on very low battery level, the unit will still show one light; showing none would be better - Purple hue to flashlight: this might be just my unit, but the flashlight has a heavy purple/blue hue to it and not as white (or bright) as expected Final verdict is a 4-star from me, which means if you're in the market for a powerful battery back, buy this thing as you probably will be hard pressed to find a better one with this quality/price balance. I reserve 5-stars for products that is perfect in my book and I love using. This one is nearly there but did leave me with some slight frustration at the misleading charging indicator, the missing A/C adapter, and the dimmer purple flashlight.", "id": 15342811}
{"review": "UPDATED REVIEW: Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000mAh Battery Anker sent me the 2nd Gen Astro E4 battery to review as the original review was getting a bit dated. In summary, the 2nd Gen Astro E4 definitely improved on a few items that were problematic with original version. Even if you are not upgrading from the 1st Gen, I believe the improvements are still worth considering compared to other batteries on the market. Improvements compared to 1st Gen Astro E4: - Slimmer (But Longer) Body: While the 1st Gen Astro E4 was wide and shaped like a portable hard-drive, the 2nd Gen version is shaped like a flat glasses case (or a fancy pen case). This shape is much easier to slip into a front/rear pants pocket (albeit a loose fitting pair of pants). Both version weigh about the same. - Increased Efficiency to 86% (11200mAh Actual): As stated in the original review, no batteries ever hit their capacity but this one came fairly close. This updated version hit 11200mAh while the original version only reached 9200mAh. I was able to charge my Nexus 5 phone fully about 5 times or my Nexus 7 tablet about 3 times. This will be my go-to battery for extended trips away from an outlet. For those of you using Apple's latest iPad Air, this will charge it fully about 1.2 times. - 3A Maximum Output: With the new PowerIQ technology, either of the two USB ports can now charge to a total maximum of 3A. There is no longer a need to remember which port is the higher output port. Anker also increased the maximum to 3A for newer devices that support this amperage, which is a nice upgrade from the 2A of the 1st Gen. - Flat Side Activate Button: The activate button for the battery is now on the side of the unit and flat against the body; this allows the battery to be turned on easily without accidentally switching on the flashlight mode; the old placement was very susceptible to this issue. - White LED Flashlight: The 1st Gen Astro E4's flashlight was quite purple/blue; I'm happy to report that this has now been fixed. The white LED flashlight is quite a useful feature! - No More Adapters: The 2nd Gen simply comes with one MicroUSB cable instead of an adapter cable with multiple heads. I hated the adapters heads as they kept falling off and getting lost. This actually decreased the functionality of the cable, but it is an improvement in my book. At least now I have an extra MicroUSB cable instead of a bag of useless adapters. Compared to my original review, the only negative aspect of the new Astro E4 battery is that it still doesn't come with a USB-AC adapter; be prepared to bring your own. The 2nd Gen E4 still has auto-on/off for maximum battery usage and the four blue LED power indicator. All in all, a great high-capacity portable battery and a great update from Anker. ----------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW: Anker 1st Gen Astro E4 13000mAh Battery Since Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback and review, I decided to take the Astro E4 power bank through its paces to see how it performs.

{"review": "This review is on Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000 mAh black battery pack. This battery pack is a real work horse and full of energy and in my test results it performed extremely well in supplying a charging current to an iPad Air and an iPhone 5S. It is also designed to allow you to charge two items at the same time. It comes with a charging cable that you need to charge the power pack itself. You may need to use your original charging cables for some of your devices so take them with you if you need them. It is a great power resource to keep your USB recharged devices operating on those long work or school days or while you are traveling. This battery pack is a powerful source of power and many people like me are power users of their smart phones and tablets and need a battery like this. If you are constantly using your phone or tablet then you know that they will run out of power sometime during the day or evening. If you are not near an AC wall outlet with your charger or in your car with a charger what can you do? It is especially important to have some way to recharge if you are traveling in a plane, in the middle of a school classroom or on a bus or train. In addition many of the newer tablets are real power hungry devices and it takes a lot to recharge them. Here is a powerful battery pack with two USB ports. It can charge your tablet devices or charge your smart phone and if you want it can do both of them simultaneously. I charged two iPhones at the same time in my testing. Both USB outputs are IQ ports so they adapt the charging current to match the type of device you plug in. It states that the ports can output 3 amps and when both ports are used the maximum output of the battery is also 3 Amps. In my testing the most current I saw out of a single port was 1.7 Amps when charging only an iPad Air. The unit also has an LED flashlight in it for emergencies. It uses Lithium battery technology and carries a 13000 mAh capacity. This is a medium sized battery pack and it weighs in weighs in at 10 ounces. This battery pack will fit easily into a brief case, back pack or a computer bag or a large purse. When I test a battery I do an extensive set of tests that fully charges the battery and then I use it to charge devices and make sure that it is fully depleted when my tests are done. I time each test and document the results as the test progresses. I then calculate the mAh of capacity that the battery supplied and I then calculate its charging efficiency. This process takes from 3 hours to, in very large batteries, about a day for testing. I don't take any short cuts or guess and every battery has these tests performed on it and documented. This is to assure that the battery is tested and it performs well. If a battery has performed poorly I then run the tests again to verify the results. What's in the box? * The Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000 mAh black battery pack * The battery pack comes with an instruction manual * The battery does not come with an AC wall charger. Use the Micro USB charging tip for charging the battery. You can use a computer USB 2.0 port to charge the battery pack but it is 13000 mAh and it will take 25 to 28 hours to charge. The manual states to use a 2.0 Amp USB wall charger and it will take 6 to 7 hours but I recommend using a 2.1 amp AC wall charger if you have one. * There is one charging cable for the battery pack or your smart devices that use a Micro USB plug. It is 27 inches long. * The battery comes with a nylon mesh carrying bag so the battery doesn't get scratched when you are carrying it. it also keeps items out of the charging ports. (Within reason.) This is a very good product and below I have listed its features and benefits as well as my test data for your review. The Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000 mAh battery pack features: * Powerful 13000 mAh capacity specification * The unit is compact in size and weighs in at 10 ounces * It is designed in a black plastic that is nice looking but a bit of a finger print magnet. * When you plug in your device it will start charging. When it is full the charging will automatically stop or it will also stop when you unplug the cable from the battery. * It has a four LEDs that indicate the battery's charged capacity. Just for clarity just assume that each LED represent 25% of the battery's capacity.

{"review": "This review is on Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000 mAh black battery pack. This battery pack is a real work horse and full of energy and in my test results it performed extremely well in supplying a charging current to an iPad Air and an iPhone 5S. It is also designed to allow you to charge two items at the same time. It comes with a charging cable that you need to charge the power pack itself. You may need to use your original charging cables for some of your devices so take them with you if you need them. It is a great power resource to keep your USB recharged devices operating on those long work or school days or while you are traveling. This battery pack is a powerful source of power and many people like me are power users of their smart phones and tablets and need a battery like this. If you are constantly using your phone or tablet then you know that they will run out of power sometime during the day or evening. If you are not near an AC wall outlet with your charger or in your car with a charger what can you do? It is especially important to have some way to recharge if you are traveling in a plane, in the middle of a school classroom or on a bus or train. In addition many of the newer tablets are real power hungry devices and it takes a lot to recharge them. Here is a powerful battery pack with two USB ports. It can charge your tablet devices or charge your smart phone and if you want it can do both of them simultaneously. I charged two iPhones at the same time in my testing. Both USB outputs are IQ ports so they adapt the charging current to match the type of device you plug in. It states that the ports can output 3 amps and when both ports are used the maximum output of the battery is also 3 Amps. In my testing the most current I saw out of a single port was 1.7 Amps when charging only an iPad Air. The unit also has an LED flashlight in it for emergencies. It uses Lithium battery technology and carries a 13000 mAh capacity. This is a medium sized battery pack and it weighs in weighs in at 10 ounces. This battery pack will fit easily into a brief case, back pack or a computer bag or a large purse. When I test a battery I do an extensive set of tests that fully charges the battery and then I use it to charge devices and make sure that it is fully depleted when my tests are done. I time each test and document the results as the test progresses. I then calculate the mAh of capacity that the battery supplied and I then calculate its charging efficiency. This process takes from 3 hours to, in very large batteries, about a day for testing. I don't take any short cuts or guess and every battery has these tests performed on it and documented. This is to assure that the battery is tested and it performs well. If a battery has performed poorly I then run the tests again to verify the results. What's in the box? * The Anker 2nd Gen Astro E4 13000 mAh black battery pack * The battery pack comes with an instruction manual * The battery does not come with an AC wall charger.

The manual states to use a 2.0 Amp USB wall charger and it will take 6 to 7 hours but I recommend using a 2.1 amp AC wall charger if you have one. * There is one charging cable for the battery pack or your smart devices that use a Micro USB plug. It is 27 inches long. * The battery comes with a nylon mesh carrying bag so the battery doesn't get scratched when you are carrying it. it also keeps items out of the charging ports. (Within reason.)

{"review": "The 8500 series Passports have been around for slightly over a decade and have seen two major revisions. This is the current, 2011, revision. I own all three revisions (8500, 8500 X50, and now 8500 X50 Black), and I give this product a lot of praise. For most drivers, this is one of the best choices in its price range. The X-band performance on all models has been great. For this revision, K and Ka bands have seen substantial improvements, as has the 'ramp-up', which is how a signal has a progressive increase to and decrease from the target. Its laser performance and filtering is unchanged. Like the previous model, its filtering is the best in the business. It's off axis detection seems to be improved, thanks to a newer type of lens. The speaker is LOUD, which is what you want, and the tone sounds are very distinct. Like the previous models (and virtually all detectors), do NOT rely on it for LIDAR (laser) detection. For that you need a LIDAR jammer. The black color is a nice change as it does not clash with interiors and it looks much sharper than the previous silver colored one. The display is as crisp as always and the included true hard-carry and padded zipper case is a nice upgrade from the plastic box. This is a true travel case and great for the mobile user. As always, the mounting hardware and SmartCord are excellent (the SmartCord allows you to mute an alert without touching the unit and seeing an active alarm when the unit is in 'Dark' mode. The frequency display, expert meter, band customization, city sensitivity customization, voltage display and more give users many features allowing them to customize the unit for their area and specific driving. If you aren't a customizer, then it is ready to go out-of-the-box and is VERY simple to use and reprogram (of so desired). Escort's extended warranty of an additional 2 years for $30 is very reasonable as well and their 30-day risk-free trial is also nice given this is a big purchase. Being able to get it with a blue display is nice, although I swear by the red myself as I find it easier to read, especially at night. It does, however, lack a few features. The first is voice alerts. Some people love these, and some hate them. I love them, but it isn't a major issue IMO. It also lacks substantial protection against 'quick trigger' radar, which is instant on radar that goes from asleep-to on-to lock a speed-and back to 'sleep'. It is simply not fast enough to detect this short signal, which is very common in some areas. However, it is not used at all in others and for its price point I would not let this discourage you from buying it. It also does not detect the 16 millisecond K-band POP2 (it's POP settings detect the 33.6-33.8 GHz Ka-band 67 millisecond POP), and turning POP on will greatly increase false alerts with a reduction in distance on all non-POP frequencies. However, unlike QT, POP is very rare. The Bottom Line?...Well, perhaps everything I have thus far said makes no sense if you aren't a radar detector person...if that is the case, let me sum it up in a not-so-dorky fashion. The detector offers good to excellent range on virtually every type of radar, still has the same laser limitations of other detectors (get a jammer), looks really good in person, has a lot of features that let you customize your unit for you, and is VERY easy to use. It has made some substantial improvements over the previous two silver-colored models, and so I would look at the X50 Black (which is this model) over them. So in layman's terms this is a pretty darn good pick for most users and is an excellent overall value.", "id": 172529}

{"review": "This thing can smell bacon from miles out. Laser 17272 <--------look out for this gun (that is what my ticket had written on it), not many officers have it, but if they have line of sight (if they are hidden from view, it doesn't take long to get a lock as you crest a hill or turn a long corner), if they are only gunning potential speeders (people that look as if they are breaking the limit), and have their ka-band switched off, then you my friend, are a sitting duck (with ALL detectors). Drive more appropriately during daylight hours, because at night, they won't have ka turned off and you'll know about them miles in advance. Do your speeding at night! I made it from Miami to Madison averaging over 100mph (wide, open, empty highways) with lunch and fuel stops included (about a week after buying the 8500). This thing gave me about 45 seconds of warning each time that I approached a trap, most of the time I kept on speeding for 15-30 seconds, you'll see the signal bar slowly growing, it must run on magic.

{"review": "The 8500 series Passports have been around for slightly over a decade and have seen two major revisions. This is the current, 2011, revision. I own all three revisions (8500, 8500 X50, and now 8500 X50 Black), and I give this product a lot of praise. For most drivers, this is one of the best choices in its price range. The X-band performance on all models has been great. For this revision, K and Ka bands have seen substantial improvements, as has the 'ramp-up', which is how a signal has a progressive increase to and decrease from the target. Its laser performance and filtering is unchanged. Like the previous model, its filtering is the best in the business. It's off axis detection seems to be improved, thanks to a newer type of lens. The speaker is LOUD, which is what you want, and the tone sounds are very distinct. Like the previous models (and virtually all detectors), do NOT rely on it for LIDAR (laser) detection. For that you need a LIDAR jammer. The black color is a nice change as it does not clash with interiors and it looks much sharper than the previous silver colored one. The display is as crisp as always and the included true hard-carry and padded zipper case is a nice upgrade from the plastic box. This is a true travel case and great for the mobile user. As always, the mounting hardware and SmartCord are excellent (the SmartCord allows you to mute an alert without touching the unit and seeing an active alarm when the unit is in 'Dark' mode. The frequency display, expert meter, band customization, city sensitivity customization, voltage display and more give users many features allowing them to customize the unit for their area and specific driving. If you aren't a customizer, then it is ready to go out-of-the-box and is VERY simple to use and reprogram (of so desired). Escort's extended warranty of an additional 2 years for $30 is very reasonable as well and their 30-day risk-free trial is also nice given this is a big purchase. Being able to get it with a blue display is nice, although I swear by the red myself as I find it easier to read, especially at night. It does, however, lack a few features. The first is voice alerts. Some people love these, and some hate them. I love them, but it isn't a major issue IMO. It also lacks substantial protection against 'quick trigger' radar, which is instant on radar that goes from asleep-to on-to lock a speed-and back to 'sleep'. It is simply not fast enough to detect this short signal, which is very common in some areas. However, it is not used at all in others and for its price point I would not let this discourage you from buying it. It also does not detect the 16 millisecond K-band POP2 (it's POP settings detect the 33.6-33.8 GHz Ka-band 67 millisecond POP), and turning POP on will greatly increase false alerts with a reduction in distance on all non-POP frequencies. However, unlike QT, POP is very rare. The Bottom Line?...Well, perhaps everything I have thus far said makes no sense if you aren't a radar detector person...if that is the case, let me sum it up in a not-so-dorky fashion. The detector offers good to excellent range on virtually every type of radar, still has the same laser limitations of other detectors (get a jammer), looks really good in person, has a lot of features that let you customize your unit for you, and is VERY easy to use. It has made some substantial improvements over the previous two silver-colored models, and so I would look at the X50 Black (which is this model) over them. So in layman's terms this is a pretty darn good pick for most users and is an excellent overall value.", "id": 172529}

However, it is not used at all in others and for its price point I would not let this discourage you from buying it. It also does not detect the 16 millisecond K-band POP2 (it's POP settings detect the 33.6-33.8 GHz Ka-band 67 millisecond POP), and turning POP on will greatly increase false alerts with a reduction in distance on all non-POP frequencies. However, unlike QT, POP is very rare. The Bottom Line?...Well, perhaps everything I have thus far said makes no sense if you aren't a radar detector person...if that is the case, let me sum it up in a not-so-dorky fashion. The detector offers good to excellent range on virtually every type of radar, still has the same laser limitations of other detectors (get a jammer), looks really good in person, has a lot of features that let you customize your unit for you, and is VERY easy to use. It has made some substantial improvements over the previous two silver-colored models, and so I would look at the X50 Black (which is this model) over them. So in layman's terms this is a pretty darn good pick for most users and is an excellent overall value.", "id": 7230274011}
{"review": "The 8500 series Passports have been around for slightly over a decade and have seen two major revisions. This is the current, 2011, revision. I own all three revisions (8500, 8500 X50, and now 8500 X50 Black), and I give this product a lot of praise. For most drivers, this is one of the best choices in its price range. The X-band performance on all models has been great. For this revision, K and Ka bands have seen substantial improvements, as has the 'ramp-up', which is how a signal has a progressive increase to and decrease from the target. Its laser performance and filtering is unchanged. Like the previous model, its filtering is the best in the business. It's off axis detection seems to be improved, thanks to a newer type of lens. The speaker is LOUD, which is what you want, and the tone sounds are very distinct. Like the previous models (and virtually all detectors), do NOT rely on it for LIDAR (laser) detection. For that you need a LIDAR jammer. The black color is a nice change as it does not clash with interiors and it looks much sharper than the previous silver colored one. The display is as crisp as always and the included true hard-carry and padded zipper case is a nice upgrade from the plastic box. This is a true travel case and great for the mobile user. As always, the mounting hardware and SmartCord are excellent (the SmartCord allows you to mute an alert without touching the unit and seeing an active alarm when the unit is in 'Dark' mode. The frequency display, expert meter, band customization, city sensitivity customization, voltage display and more give users many features allowing them to customize the unit for their area and specific driving. If you aren't a customizer, then it is ready to go out-of-the-box and is VERY simple to use and reprogram (of so desired). Escort's extended warranty of an additional 2 years for $30 is very reasonable as well and their 30-day risk-free trial is also nice given this is a big purchase. Being able to get it with a blue display is nice, although I swear by the red myself as I find it easier to read, especially at night. It does, however, lack a few features. The first is voice alerts. Some people love these, and some hate them. I love them, but it isn't a major issue IMO.

{"review": "I really struggled with giving this a 5 but ultimately did because my issue is probably the exception to the rule. This is my 2nd Escort 8500 actually. After going to a top of the line Whister (the XTR-695 I believe) for a few months when the 1st one was stolen, I'm back to an 8500 and happy about it. First the good stuff: 1) Great range. I'm very happy with the sensitivity, it gives plenty of warning time. 2) Menus are relatively easy to navigate and give lots of options. 3) On the loud volume range there is plenty of volume, but MAKE SURE you change it to the loud setting. Just spinning the volume wheel is not all there is to it! I have a electric cutout exhaust and with the cutouts wide open (no mufflers) and music turned loud enough to hear over that I still can hear it well enough to know when I need to slow down. 4) Display is nice and bright and easy to read in all lighting situations. Now for what I DON'T like but most of you won't care: 1) If you use the regular windshield suction cup mount AND you have a steep angle on your windshield it's very difficult to get it level. I have a C5 Corvette Z06 and if bend the bracket enough for detector to be level, the tops of the suction cups don't clear the top of the detector itself as you slide it back against the windshield. I have it at an angle now where they are smashed against the top of the detector and it still sags downward in the front a few degrees. I'm sure it still works fine like that but it's irritating. I still give a 5 because it's still better then the Whistler bracket which didn't lock securely and under hard accelleration it would end up in my lap whereas the 8500 stay firmly in place even if it is at a slightly downward angle.

{"review": "I bought this before taking a trip to So Cal. There were a few false alarms, but overall this thing worked like a charm. It seems that the CHP uses Ka band for the most part and the passport would pick it up as much as a mile out. I was consistently driving 85 and slowing down to 70 when i received an alert. Doing this saved me a couple hours of driving time. This device doesn't make you invincible. You are still susceptible to laser, POP and aircraft, but you will get lots of advance warning for the majority of speed traps. EDIT: I still think this is a perfectly good radar detector, but if i had it to do over again i would buy one that has GPS and false alarm lockout. I drive the same route every day and this thing goes off in the same spots every time. Sure i can mute it but it would be nice to have one of the detectors that just remembers and ignores where your false alarms are. Still though it's a good product and i haven't had a ticket since purchasing it.", "id": 172529}

Get one that will charge your devices at full speed (like the one that came with your device). This is not so simple. Product info is often unclear. Reviewers are often unclear. For starters, the \"Amps\" need to be high enough. That's usually 1 Amp for smartphones, about 2 Amps for tablets. (A higher amp charger is always OK.) The messy part is, Apple devices use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa, even if its Amp rating is high enough. - - - About this PowerGen Wall Charger - - - PowerGen gets it right by optimizing one port for Apple products (including iPad) and the second port for non-apple products.

{"review": "Length:: 0:59 Mins If your home is like mine you are running out of wall sockets to charge all of your toys. Our iPhones, iPads, iPods, iPod Touches, Bluetooth headphones, and on and on all have a separate wall charger. Here is a nice product; no I mean a great product that features two USB sockets for your smart phones, tablets and accessories. I have successfully charged the following devices without any problems: * iPad 2 only on the A port * iPad 3 only on the A port * iPod 60 GIG only worked on the NA port as it is an old school Apple charging design * iPod touch on both ports * Kindle Fire on both ports * Kindle Keyboard on both ports * iPhone 4 on both ports I like that the wall charger has two USB charging ports and it can charge two devices at the same time. (Like our two iPhones simultaneously) The unit did not charge the HP TouchPad as claimed but so far I have tried a dozen different charging devices and none of them will charge the HP TouchPad except the original HP charger and the HP Touchstone. The HP TouchPad requires a strong 5.3 VDC at 2.08 Amps. When I tried it I got the HP error message that the charging device was not supplying either enough voltage or current to effectively charge it. The unit can provide up to 2.1 amps which is the rated charging rate for an Apple iPad 3. If you plug in multiple devices they both will still charge (They share the 2.1 Amps) but if one of them requires more than ½ of the 2.1 amp power it will charge more slowly than with its own AC wall charger. Plugging in only one device provides up to 2.1 Amps to either USB port. Smart devices are self-limiting as to how much current they will draw and it is safe to use a higher current charger as your smart phone for example will stop charging when it is full. Usually smart phones like our iPhone charge at 1 amp but they will charge faster and safely at 2.1 amps. The Apple iPad 2's and iPad 3's like 2.1 amps to charge with but will charge at 1 Amp at a slower rate. The iPad 3 is a power hog with an 11,560 mAh battery capacity and can use up to 1.24 amps just operating on a mobile wireless version. If it is plugged in and left on then it will charge very slowly even with the original Apple charger. The plug has a small blue status LED that indicates that the unit is plugged into a live outlet. I like it because the light is very small and dim and not bright like most wall plug LED's. Your bedroom sometimes looks like Christmas with all of the items plugged in today's modern world with all of the LED's lit up at night. The unit also features protection circuitry that monitors over-heating, over-current and over-charging protection. The unit I received had the charging ports clearly marked and it included an instruction manual that was not bad. This is nice AC power charger and I like it a lot. For $9.99 it is a good buy and well worth the money for how it performs. It even works on 240 VAC and 50 Hertz so it is good for overseas travel as long as you take your European plug socket adapters. I was provided an evaluation unit for testing and agreed to provide a fair and honest review.", "id": 2516700011}

If you plug in multiple devices they both will still charge (They share the 2.1 Amps) but if one of them requires more than ½ of the 2.1 amp power it will charge more slowly than with its own AC wall charger. Plugging in only one device provides up to 2.1 Amps to either USB port. Smart devices are self-limiting as to how much current they will draw and it is safe to use a higher current charger as your smart phone for example will stop charging when it is full. Usually smart phones like our iPhone charge at 1 amp but they will charge faster and safely at 2.1 amps. The Apple iPad 2's and iPad 3's like 2.1 amps to charge with but will charge at 1 Amp at a slower rate. The iPad 3 is a power hog with an 11,560 mAh battery capacity and can use up to 1.24 amps just operating on a mobile wireless version. If it is plugged in and left on then it will charge very slowly even with the original Apple charger. The plug has a small blue status LED that indicates that the unit is plugged into a live outlet. I like it because the light is very small and dim and not bright like most wall plug LED's. Your bedroom sometimes looks like Christmas with all of the items plugged in today's modern world with all of the LED's lit up at night. The unit also features protection circuitry that monitors over-heating, over-current and over-charging protection. The unit I received had the charging ports clearly marked and it included an instruction manual that was not bad. This is nice AC power charger and I like it a lot. For $9.99 it is a good buy and well worth the money for how it performs. It even works on 240 VAC and 50 Hertz so it is good for overseas travel as long as you take your European plug socket adapters. I was provided an evaluation unit for testing and agreed to provide a fair and honest review.", "id": 3545231011}

{"review": "Length:: 0:08 Mins Please note that this is review for PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger (white) not PowerGen Dual USB 2.4A 12w Travel Wall Charger with Swivel plug. Amazon seem to have combined the reviews for these two different wall chargers (the new and the old versions). I am following up with Amazon on this issue. ==================================================================================== I tested PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger with Nexus 7 Tablet, Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus cell phone, and SanDisk Sansa Clip+ player. My original test for Nexus devices was using Jelly Bean 4.1, I repeated the tests for Jelly Bean 4.21 and saw a significant difference. I updated this review to show the differences between two releases. I received PowerGen wall charger for testing from the manufacturer to write an honest and unbiased review and you will find both pluses and minuses of my experience in this review. I am attaching a collage of 5 photos labeled with numbers 1 through 5 that I will be referencing in this review. The first thing I noticed that this wall charger is fairly small, it takes up only one slot on the extension cord. Photos #1 and #4 show this plug on two different power strips. The plug has two ports labeled \"A\" and \"NA\" which stands for Apple and Non-Apple devices. I own all Android devices but I tested both ports to see their behavior with my devices. The charger comes without a USB cord, so tested it with the USB cords that came with my devices. I used Battery App to determine how each device recognized the external battery pack. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge. The key findings: (1) Samsung Galaxy 7.7 cannot be charged with this wall charger with either port (2) \"A\" port provides reduced power for some non-Apple devices and does not work for others *** Update 1/9/2013 *** Thanks to comment by Ajith Antony I repeated the test with Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.21 and both ports are now charging it at AC rate. The original test which showed poor performance on Apple port was Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.1. I also retested Galaxy Nexus Phone running CyanogenMod 10.1 version of Jelly Bean 4.21, but it showed no improvement. It still gets only USB charging rate on Apple port. The table below summarizes my findings: Nexus 7 Tablet (photo #4 and #5, note that the left port is labeled \"A\" and the right port is labeled \"NA\") -------------- A port -- discharging (Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.1.) A port -- AC (Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.21) NA port -- AC Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone -------------------------- A port -- USB NA port -- AC Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7 -------------------------- A port -- discharging NA port -- discharging SanDisk Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player ------------------------------ A port -- charged at USB rate NA port -- charged at AC rate The behavior with Nexus devices was consistent and good on \"NA\" port. Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone gets USB rate on Apple \"A\" port. After upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.21 Nexus 7 gets AC rate on both ports. The behavior of both Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus plugged in at the same time was the same as when they were plugged in individually. This means if you want to recharge both Nexus 7 Tab and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time there is only one combination that works: Nexus 7 Tablet and Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone at the same time -------------------------------------------------------------- NA port -- Nexus 7 Tablet -- AC rate A port -- Galaxy Nexus Phone -- USB rate Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7 (running Honecomb 3.2) did not work (was discharging) in both ports. The MP3 player worked in both ports, but as USB rate in \"A\" port and at \"AC\" rate in in \"NA\" port. When I charge Sansa MP3 with a standard AC charger (photo #3), the MP3 player goes into charging mode, displaying the charging animated icon, the MP3 content is not played. When MP3 was plugged into the PowerGen plug (photo #3) it continued to play the content. I listen to books on my MP3 player so this caused me to move forward in my book and I had to manually reset my position by a few chapters to get back to where I was when I started charging. The positive side of this, is that is possible to continue listening while MP3 is recharging. To summarize: I liked: --------- 1. Good behavior with Nexus devices. 2. Solution for MP3 player with built-in battery 3. Can charge two devices (but one at a reduced rate for non-Apple devices) I did not like: -------------- 1. Did not work with for my Samsung Galaxy tablet 2. For non-Apple devices one port has less power or does not work 3. For non-Apple devices the less useful plug takes up a little extra room If you own two Apple devices that you want to use with this plug, this is what manufacturer states: The NA port is not designed for Apple device, however, it charges the iPhone at 500mAh. When charge the IPAD and iPhone at the same time, plug the iPhone first (NA port) and then the iPad (A port) to avoid the iPhone report the charger as incompatible. Overall, after upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.21 this plug has an excellent performance on both ports for Android devices. Ali Julia review", "id": 2516700011}

Overall, after upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.21 this plug has an excellent performance on both ports for Android devices. Ali Julia review", "id": 3545231011}
{"review": "Length:: 0:08 Mins Please note that this is review for PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger (white) not PowerGen Dual USB 2.4A 12w Travel Wall Charger with Swivel plug. Amazon seem to have combined the reviews for these two different wall chargers (the new and the old versions). I am following up with Amazon on this issue. ==================================================================================== I tested PowerGen Dual Port USB 2.1A 10W AC Travel Wall Charger with Nexus 7 Tablet, Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus cell phone, and SanDisk Sansa Clip+ player. My original test for Nexus devices was using Jelly Bean 4.1, I repeated the tests for Jelly Bean 4.21 and saw a significant difference. I updated this review to show the differences between two releases. I received PowerGen wall charger for testing from the manufacturer to write an honest and unbiased review and you will find both pluses and minuses of my experience in this review. I am attaching a collage of 5 photos labeled with numbers 1 through 5 that I will be referencing in this review. The first thing I noticed that this wall charger is fairly small, it takes up only one slot on the extension cord. Photos #1 and #4 show this plug on two different power strips. The plug has two ports labeled \"A\" and \"NA\" which stands for Apple and Non-Apple devices. I own all Android devices but I tested both ports to see their behavior with my devices. The charger comes without a USB cord, so tested it with the USB cords that came with my devices. I used Battery App to determine how each device recognized the external battery pack. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge. The key findings: (1) Samsung Galaxy 7.7 cannot be charged with this wall charger with either port (2) \"A\" port provides reduced power for some non-Apple devices and does not work for others *** Update 1/9/2013 *** Thanks to comment by Ajith Antony I repeated the test with Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.21 and both ports are now charging it at AC rate. The original test which showed poor performance on Apple port was Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.1. I also retested Galaxy Nexus Phone running CyanogenMod 10.1 version of Jelly Bean 4.21, but it showed no improvement. It still gets only USB charging rate on Apple port. The table below summarizes my findings: Nexus 7 Tablet (photo #4 and #5, note that the left port is labeled \"A\" and the right port is labeled \"NA\") -------------- A port -- discharging (Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.1.) A port -- AC (Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean 4.21) NA port -- AC Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone -------------------------- A port -- USB NA port -- AC Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7 -------------------------- A port -- discharging NA port -- discharging SanDisk Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player ------------------------------ A port -- charged at USB rate NA port -- charged at AC rate The behavior with Nexus devices was consistent and good on \"NA\" port. Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone gets USB rate on Apple \"A\" port. After upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.21 Nexus 7 gets AC rate on both ports. The behavior of both Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus plugged in at the same time was the same as when they were plugged in individually. This means if you want to recharge both Nexus 7 Tab and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time there is only one combination that works: Nexus 7 Tablet and Samsung Galaxy Nexus Phone at the same time -------------------------------------------------------------- NA port -- Nexus 7 Tablet -- AC rate A port -- Galaxy Nexus Phone -- USB rate Samsung Galaxy Tablet 7.7 (running Honecomb 3.2) did not work (was discharging) in both ports. The MP3 player worked in both ports, but as USB rate in \"A\" port and at \"AC\" rate in in \"NA\" port. When I charge Sansa MP3 with a standard AC charger (photo #3), the MP3 player goes into charging mode, displaying the charging animated icon, the MP3 content is not played. When MP3 was plugged into the PowerGen plug (photo #3) it continued to play the content. I listen to books on my MP3 player so this caused me to move forward in my book and I had to manually reset my position by a few chapters to get back to where I was when I started charging. The positive side of this, is that is possible to continue listening while MP3 is recharging. To summarize: I liked: --------- 1. Good behavior with Nexus devices. 2. Solution for MP3 player with built-in battery 3. Can charge two devices (but one at a reduced rate for non-Apple devices) I did not like: -------------- 1. Did not work with for my Samsung Galaxy tablet 2. For non-Apple devices one port has less power or does not work 3.

This means I can't use it. I won't risk causing a fire - any non-UL charger scares me and should scare you! Second, it can't charge my iphone and ipad at the same time.

{"review": "Bought it a month ago for use with 3 Blackberries (rotation). Ports are marked NA and A. Assume NA means non-Apple. Blackberry charged on NA. Didn't charge on A. Why? The data pair (2 pins) are shorted in the NA port. Many phones (many Blackberries) want to see this configuration from a wall charge unit. So what do you if you want to charge 2 Blackberries at once? You buy USB charging cables. What's a USB charging cable? It's a USB cable with the 2 data pins shorted out. Whether we're talking 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0, there are still two kinds of cables. The ones that ship with phones are called Data cables. For wall chargers, you're better off with an honest to goodness charging cable. All the cables I've collected over the years came with phones. So they're all data cables. Data cables don't have the data pair shorted out. Charging cables do. After figuring this out, I dragged out a bunch of old wall chargers that I couldn't get to work with my Blackberries over the years. With the charging cables they all work. Looking around the internet reviews, it looks like an awful lot of people don't understand this distinction. As far as I can tell, any wall charger will work with any phone or tablet as long as the Amp (wattage) requirement is met. No mystery. You'd think all the folks that make USB wall chargers would short out the data pair to avoid all those negative comments on the internet about their charger not working with this or that. Since the Apple port (A) isn't shorted, assume that Apple doesn't like to see the data pair shorted. Why? It's a wall charger. No data ever.", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "This charger does not do what it is advertised to do -- it will not provide adequate amperage to the iPad3 that requires 2.1A. I've tried this with a variety of cables including the one that comes with the Apple-branded charger that came with the iPad3 and after initially starting to charge, the iPad shows \"NOT CHARGING\". The charger gets very hot when attempting to charge, so I don't know if it has a problem or not. It works okay for charging my iPhone 4S, but I already have plenty of chargers for that -- I need some for my iPad3 & iPad4. The seller of this charger sent me an email about 2 weeks ago asking me to rate my Amazon experience and I told them about the issue. They said they'd send a replacement but it hasn't arrived. I'll be returning this one for a refund from Amazon.", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "Apple devices have a proprietary handshake to tell a charger that it can deliver high power (1A or 2.1A for example). (For more info do a search on LadyAda iPod Charger) Separately, most other devices have a handshake (a recent addition to the USB handshake rules) that allows a charger to deliver all the power it can to the device. This adapter supports both! So, you can charge both your Kindle or Motorola Droid, and your iPad or iPhone. There are two ports on this device. One for Apple (\"A\") and one for non-apple (\"NA\"). Now, I realize that there are cheaper alternatives, but I've gotten tired of skimping on chargers and other accessories and then having to buy yet another one later because it didn't support my device. With this thing, I can support all the devices in my house. (The alternatives are half the cost--but that's only $5 less.) Very happy I got it. Will probably order another one.", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "So with over 900 reviews i doubt this will get read by many but i wanted to get this published all the same. I do a lot of testing with various portable batteries and cables, and i have found this cable to do just fine with data transfer speeds at the expected USB 2 speeds, but find that its power transfer rates are quite sub-par. The look and feel of this cable would lead you to believe its a good quality cable, but it doesn't charge like one. On a 1000 MAh power source it will only pull 800 MAh, i have occasionally seen it get a bit higher, but not consistently. A quality cable can push all 1000MAh to a normal USB device like a phone. Even when upping the output source to 2000 or 2100 MAh there is little change. USB Standards prevent a full 2000 MAh through a USB cable, but most good cables will max out at 1200 MAh. Again this is cable sits tight around 800. Overall this may not be something most people care about but it should be noted that it will caused longer charge times to your devices.", "id": 15379741}

On a 1000 MAh power source it will only pull 800 MAh, i have occasionally seen it get a bit higher, but not consistently. A quality cable can push all 1000MAh to a normal USB device like a phone. Even when upping the output source to 2000 or 2100 MAh there is little change. USB Standards prevent a full 2000 MAh through a USB cable, but most good cables will max out at 1200 MAh. Again this is cable sits tight around 800. Overall this may not be something most people care about but it should be noted that it will caused longer charge times to your devices.", "id": 1297805011}

{"review": "This AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A Male to Micro USB B Male Cable is the one that you need to connect the Kindle Fire to a computer, so that files can be transferred between the two. The Micro USB plug will fit only one way, so be careful when you plug it into the Fire. This cable is 6 ft. long and is very well-made. The $6 price is very reasonable. Once you connect it to a PC or Mac, the Kindle Fire's screen will show a picture of a USB cable with a black background and the message: You can now transfer files from your computer to Kindle. You can also buy a very inexpensive accessory made by Amazon under the same label AmazonBasics ( AmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet( 2.1 Amp Output)) that, when combined with this cable, can charge the Kindle Fire (The Fire already comes with a charger in the box, so if you get this one, it would be a spare, or one for the office, for example). It's a small, high current (2.1 A) USB charger that has foldable plug prong so it can be conveniently stored when not in use. You cannot charge the Kindle Fire using a regular charger or the USB port on a computer because they do not output enough current to charge it (in a reasonable amount of time). It's less than $10 and very versatile and convenient. You can also use it to charge an iPad or any USB device.", "id": 15379741}

You seriously cannot go wrong for the price of this. it seems well-made, not as flimsy as some cables I've gotten that degrade around the ends after use. The connections seem strong and durable. Overall I would have to say it works and it's inexpensive, I'll be buying more of these at this price. oh, one more thing. Be sure you understand the difference between \"micro\" and \"mini\" USB. a lot of cameras and portable hard drives use the MiniUSB, not the micro. so be sure you are getting the correct cable for your needs. And in case you're wondering, this MicroUSB works great with the Motorola Droid phone!", "id": 7230258011}

{"review": "A cable is a cable is a cable, right? That's what I thought until I purchased a few of these cables to charge my Droid X.

I thought the micro-USB port on my phone was going bad, but every non-Amazon micro-USB cable I tried charged my phone regardless of the position of the cable, so the cable was obviously the problem. I finally got frustrated enough with these that I purchased the Mediabridge - USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B Cable - (6 Feet) a few days ago and so far it has worked like a charm.

{"review": "At first I was very excited for this cable. The package arrived quickly and small. The cable itself is nice and thick with gold plated connectors. The 6' length was ample to allow use of my phone while it was charging. However after about 2 weeks sometimes my phone was not charging because the connector no longer fit snugly in the phone. Initially I was concerned that my phone USB port was loose, so I tried to charge with another cable. My phone worked perfectly with another cable and had a nice crisp, snug fit. The Amazon USB cable simply fits way too loose and will not charge the phone unless you hold it at a certain angle. I am very disappointed with this, as I had high hopes and expectations.", "id": 15379741}

{"review": "I bought this 6 foot cable specifically to power my Revision B Raspberry Pi, along with an \"Amazon Basics Wall Charger with USB Outlet (2.1 Amp Output)\" supply. But the voltage measured on the GertBoard extension board I have (same as the voltage across TP1 and TP2 on the Pi) reads only 4.55V using this cable. Even though this is a nice cable using gold plated contacts, it has stamped right on it \"<28 AWG/1P AND 28AWG/2C>. This indicates that ALL the wires within the cable, both for power and data, are 28AWG wires. Some USB cables, including the 3 foot cable that ships with the CanaKit version of the Pi, which sells here on Amazon, have the following marking : \"28AWG/1P + 24AWG/2C\". These cables use 24AWG wires to carry the power in the cable. This heavier gauge wire is one reason why the Pi will get the full 5V through such a cable, as there is less 'line loss' than when a smaller gauge wire is used. I wanted a 6 foot cable because of the distance from where I use the Pi to where I want to keep the outlet strip supplying its power. Since I wanted to allow my Pi to have as close to 5V as possible using a standard 5V wall charger such as the one I mentioned above, I had to hack one of my USB A to micro B cables and replace 6 feet of its core cable with 18 AWG red/black \"zip cord\", using only about 3\" of existing cable on the connector for each end. The hacked cable was a cheap Chinese one, which has wire at the most 28 AWG and it might even be finer than that (it is unmarked). But I am still able to maintain 4.88 - 4.92V on the Pi using this hacked cable. So if you are looking to power a Raspberry Pi with this 6 foot Amazon Basics cable, as some other reviewers have mentioned doing, be aware that you may see a loss of half a volt on the Pi end. The Pi's input power specs are 4.75-5.25V, so losing half a volt puts it below specs and 'could' possibly be the cause of unstable operation. I have experienced this, which is what started my quest for a better cable. I was seeing a lot of \"waiting for hardware interrupt\" errors on boot up, and it would never finish the boot process. Getting the voltage back within specs seems to have solved the problem for me.", "id": 15379741}

{"review": "I bought this 6 foot cable specifically to power my Revision B Raspberry Pi, along with an \"Amazon Basics Wall Charger with USB Outlet (2.1 Amp Output)\" supply. But the voltage measured on the GertBoard extension board I have (same as the voltage across TP1 and TP2 on the Pi) reads only 4.55V using this cable. Even though this is a nice cable using gold plated contacts, it has stamped right on it \"<28 AWG/1P AND 28AWG/2C>. This indicates that ALL the wires within the cable, both for power and data, are 28AWG wires. Some USB cables, including the 3 foot cable that ships with the CanaKit version of the Pi, which sells here on Amazon, have the following marking : \"28AWG/1P + 24AWG/2C\". These cables use 24AWG wires to carry the power in the cable. This heavier gauge wire is one reason why the Pi will get the full 5V through such a cable, as there is less 'line loss' than when a smaller gauge wire is used. I wanted a 6 foot cable because of the distance from where I use the Pi to where I want to keep the outlet strip supplying its power. Since I wanted to allow my Pi to have as close to 5V as possible using a standard 5V wall charger such as the one I mentioned above, I had to hack one of my USB A to micro B cables and replace 6 feet of its core cable with 18 AWG red/black \"zip cord\", using only about 3\" of existing cable on the connector for each end. The hacked cable was a cheap Chinese one, which has wire at the most 28 AWG and it might even be finer than that (it is unmarked). But I am still able to maintain 4.88 - 4.92V on the Pi using this hacked cable. So if you are looking to power a Raspberry Pi with this 6 foot Amazon Basics cable, as some other reviewers have mentioned doing, be aware that you may see a loss of half a volt on the Pi end.

{"review": "Bought this to charge Nexus 7 (first gen). Charged slower then the stock cable. Length of the cable will impact the charge rate but I also noticed (on cable itself) that this cable is 28/28 AWG vs. Nexus 28/24 AWG.

{"review": "One handed mounting is very convenient. The mount seems to be made of a good quality plastic with strong knobs and hinges. It holds the iPhone 4s in an Acase(TM) iPhone 4 and 4S Superleggera PRO Dual Layer Protection (Black/Black) case (Fits AT&T, Sprint and Verizon iPhone 4 and 4S) with a the charging cable attached. Excellent - all my requirements met. However, the suction cup is almost ridiculous the way it sticks to flat smooth surfaces. After the first application, it is not coming off without some time and effort prying it away (and, yes the suction lock lever was released). I would suggest using a crowbar. It might loosen it's grip with time as some debris accumulates on the surface but that's definitely not the case when new. My initial plan was to store the mount in the glove box after each use but then I quickly realized that was just not practical. I applied it a second time and plan to leave it there until it falls off. I'm fairly sure the zombie apocalypse will arrive first, so no worries there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the sticking power of the suction cup. You want it to stay put and it will. However, I imagine the force required to remove a strong healthy non-defanged headcrab would be less than this thing. So, don't say your weren't warned. I will probably purchase one more for the other car since installation is semi-permanent.", "id": 13900851}

However, I imagine the force required to remove a strong healthy non-defanged headcrab would be less than this thing. So, don't say your weren't warned. I will probably purchase one more for the other car since installation is semi-permanent.", "id": 2407778011}
{"review": "I am so very impressed by this car mount! I have a brand new Samsung Galaxy S III which is a pretty large phone. I have been searching for the right car mount forever and reading reviews of several different makers and models. This is the only one of which I couldn't find a complaint that it didn't fit or it was too wobbly or that the thing just didn't stick to the car surface well. And guess what? It's true! This is a firm holder that sticks like crazy (don't worry, it comes off ...eventually with a lot of muscle, it's just suction device so it won't harm you car interior). The only problem I had was I could get it to stick to the vinyl dash board of my Mini Cooper which is not exactly known for interior real estate. I finally decided on the plexi-glass that covers the gigantic speedometer in the center of my dashboard. It has held really well for a couple of days now, even in the heat of a 105 degree Southern California Summer. It makes me giddy thinking about how cool my car mount is, holding my new cool phone. By the way, this car mount even fits my phone with the protective phone cover on! It was under $20 which worried me that it would be a cheap product, but it just isn't so.", "id": 13900851}

{"review": "FINAL UPDATE (March 2, 2013) - Sadly the replacement product the company sent me fell off the dashboard about 10 days ago, and I could not get it to stick solidly again using the techniques suggested. Maybe it's my 2007 Toyota dashboard, maybe it's the extreme temperatures in Southern CA. Hard to say, but my final review is that this dash mount works great until it stops working, which unfortunately seems to be in four months or less based on my experience. Hopefully they'll figure out how to solve this problem, because the iOttie One-Touch Windshield Dashboard Car Mount Holder has many other great features. But ultimately it doesn't work for me. UPDATE #2 (Jan 8, 2013) - I've been using the replacement \"One-Touch Windshield Dashboard Car Mount Holder,\" which iOttie sent me after the first one stopped sticking, for over 2 months now and it's doing the job. The one catch is that it's been during the winter months, rather than the punishing summer months when the first one failed. So I'll do a final update once my iOttie dash mount has made it through summer. So far, though, I'm very happy and would recommend this product without reservation if you live in a climate where summers aren't as long and hot as they are in southern CA. It mounts easily, is simple to use, and has very versatile positioning, which allows me to position my iPhone close to an air conditioning vent to avoid overheating. I use it just about every time I get into the car. Works great with the Waze app! It's reasonably priced, and iOttie's customer service has been admirable. (iOttie has been checking in periodically via email to see how the product is doing for me.) If the suction holds up through the summer it will definitely be a 5 star product! UPDATE #1 (Oct 23, 2012) - iOttie contacted me via email immediately after I posted my review and offered me a replacement product. Because I liked this dash mount so much aside from the sticking fail, I happily accepted. They shipped it quickly, and I've been using the iOttie ever since, with success. It's been less than a month, so I don't know if the sticking problem will happen again, but the customer service was impressive. I'll update at the 2 month mark when I can have some confidence that my complaint has been resolved. FIRST REVIEW (Oct 2, 2012): This dashboard car mount iPhone holder worked fantastically until it started falling off my dash board less than 2 months after I received it. I tried cleaning off the suction cup as directed, and that seemed to help briefly, but it wasn't a long-term fix. Disappointing.", "id": 13900851}

{"review": "The marketing for the level of suction for this product is not an exaggeration. It sticks. I mean it really sticks, even to a rough surface. I'm not joking when I say that someone under 100 pounds could use two of these to scale a skyscraper, catwoman style. Also, the way it locks into place when you insert the phone, and the ease of pushing a button to remove the phone, is very nice. You'd think that $20 would get you a cheap-made product, but it's not. Very high quality for the price. There is one issue though, and it has to do with it not being completely compatible with the iPhone 5. It makes me think that title was just slapped on, without actually testing it. Thankfully, there is a way around that. The issue is the cradle at the bottom. Even though it's adjustable left to right, it may still cover the headphone jack which is now on the bottom of the phone. I say \"may\" because if your cable is thin, this won't be an issue. But if it's larger, it means you're going to have some trouble plugging this into your sound system, when you're driving. You could solve this by removing the cradle completely if you have a screwdriver, or cutting one side of it off if you want to take the more dramatic route. Thankfully, the side hugs the phone so tightly, the cradle isn't needed (although it does add some security when you're on a bumpy road.) So that's it, it might not even affect you. But if it does, keep this in mind.", "id": 13900851}

{"review": "In a word, Awesome. This mount is just what I was looking for. I wanted something that held the device securely, but also was easy to get it in and out of. This fits the bill perfectly. It has GREAT adjustability, both vertical adjustment and then a ball adjustment for tilt. The greatest feature is how when you press the phone onto the mount it automatically clamps onto it. I have a More case ([...]) on my iphone, so I was a little concerned how the fit would be, but it works great. I originally was going to use the mount on the dash of my car. The one thing about this mount is that it is a suction cup mount. That wasn't a big deal for me because I have a plastic disk from another mount that I could tape to the dash and then suction cup onto, which was my plan. However, I gave it some thought after looking at how high quality the suction cup is on this mount and, instead, mounted it to the windshield, just under the rear view mirror. I love this position as it makes the device easily accessible. Overall, I couldn't ask for more. Update: Been using this for around 8 months now. In all the Florida summer heat, the suction cup never came off the windshield, which is a rarity! Still love the mount and would highly recommend.", "id": 13900851}

So moral to the story is that I have not had any problems using the mount with GPS maps to find places I have never been, but it's not rock solid. I cannot every remember missing a street on GPS while using it. IT FELL OFF ON ME ONCE TODAY I don't use this base a ton. I might use it once a week, and if I'm going out of town as a GPS. Today I went off-roading (with the bulky defender case) and it fell off my dash. This is after 7 months of it sticking on there fine. I didn't notice that it left any ring on the dash as seen in the \"customer submitted photos.\" I suck it back on and it worked the rest of the day. (this is that day so I don't know how long it will stay stuck now)", "id": 2407778011}
{"review": "I got this product for my mom since she replaced her old Nokia with an iPhone 4s. Of course battery life differs drastically between those models. As a result the phone would run out of juice most of the time. Pros: -Compact in size. (9cms length 2.2cms width) -Sturdy aluminum body. (Always a good thing inside a purse) -Bright silver color. (Easier to locate in a purse) -Charges in less than 2 hours using a USB wall charger. -Fully charged the phone twice on a single charge with juice left. -Handy accessories pouch and cable included. ( mini & micro USB + iPhone plug) -Auto cut off feature if not in use. Cons: -None so far. Now we no longer worry about my mom's phone running out of charge in case of emergencies. Highly recommended!!", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "Update: iSmooth Mana Mini 2600mAh Portable Power Bank So, I had always had the problem of forgetting my cable at home. Also, my girl always wants to charge HER phone (an iPhone 5). I just found an awesome product that solves both of those problems, and doesn't cost too much more than this product. If you are like me, then I recommend getting this product. I was excited to see such a great little product for such a low price. Yeah, it is not the most glamorous thing in the world, but I use it just like I would any other charger with the exception that I don't have to be near a wall outlet. I just toss this thing in my backpack. Cool stuff.", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "The Anker Astro Mini is a nice small back-up power supply to keep your power-hungry iPhone running. I ran a test with my iPhone 5 to see just how much juice you could expect. I drained my iPhone 5 down to 10%, then used the Astro mini to recharge it to 100%. The Astro still had some charge, so I drained my iPhone 5 down to 10% again, then used the Astro mini to recharge. This time I only got back to 40% charged before the Astro was done. The way I look at it, you can get ~1.2 full iPhone 5 charges from one Astro charge. Not bad and just what I needed to keep running thru a long day. I recharged the Astro from my computer USB port. It took ~ 6 hours to fully recharge (charging light turned off). It might charge a little faster with a plug-in charger, but you should plan on 6 hours (or overnight) to fully recharge. The instructions are simple and the carrying bag is fine. There are a number of adapters for included charging cord. Unfortunately, the iPhone 5 “lightning” connector is not one of them. If the lightning connector was included, it would be a 5 star.", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "I received my charger in record time! I purchased two other similar chargers at the same time for my daughters because they insisted on one of the fashion colors. They claim to have the same strength as my Anker, but don't offer nearly the charging capacity! Theirs will only charge their phones to about 75% while my Anker charges to 100% and still has enough juice to bring it up to about 40% again. I will say that it charges faster if you don't let your phone get below 10%. The device comes with a convenient carry pouch and a multi cord to work with almost any phone so you don't have to carry an additional cord. It does not have the iPhone 5 attachment.

{"review": "I bought this product about six months ago, and was very pleased with it. The quality was great and it came with a travel bag and like 6 adapters for all the popular phone models. I showed my Dad and he wanted one (since he is a truck driver and on the road a lot), so I gave him mine and decided that I'll order myself a new one on my own time. Well, after ordering from the same seller (and from the same Amazon page which indicates that it is the same item I purchased previously). I am extremely disappointed with the drop in quality. While Anker does offer my color varieties than previously, they exchanged the original travel bag with a small mesh bag, which doesn't feel the same and isn't large enough to hold the various adapters you may need plus the Astro mini itself. They also no longer include all the adapters for the popular phone models, so the only thing you get is a micro USB to charge the device (but you need an A/C wall convertor to charge it within a reasonable time). I don't have a problem with needing a separate device to charge it via the wall, but removing all the adapters means you have to purchase a convertor for each type of phone which is a hassle (might not be rated to work) and will not fit in the travel bag. With my previous purchase, I've had at least separate occasions where I let my friends use my charger, because I knew that I had an adapter regardless of the phone. That is no longer the case, plus even if you bought the adapters, the travel bag isn't big enough to hold them, which hurts the portability of it. I'm assuming the adapters aren't included because they assume you will have your original phone charger with you, and most phone chargers these days can detach via USB. However, if I had my phone charger with me, then I would be charging my phone via the wall!! I wouldn't be using the product. I bring this with me, because my phone usually last all day, but sometimes I have to stay over at work longer than usual and it's nice to know that this will charge my phone and allow it to hold a charge. Also quality wise, this is inferior. The button you use to press to charge and check the charge, is very plastic-like and doesn't depress as easily. It's a minor detail, but after you doing it for awhile, it's annoying having to firmly grasp the device and press the button when it used to just \"work\". This also leans itself to it's now 'cheap' feel. If you can find an older model, go for that! Avoid this, wouldn't recommend.", "id": 2516700011}

I bring this with me, because my phone usually last all day, but sometimes I have to stay over at work longer than usual and it's nice to know that this will charge my phone and allow it to hold a charge. Also quality wise, this is inferior. The button you use to press to charge and check the charge, is very plastic-like and doesn't depress as easily. It's a minor detail, but after you doing it for awhile, it's annoying having to firmly grasp the device and press the button when it used to just \"work\". This also leans itself to it's now 'cheap' feel. If you can find an older model, go for that! Avoid this, wouldn't recommend.", "id": 7073960011}
{"review": "I bought this product about six months ago, and was very pleased with it. The quality was great and it came with a travel bag and like 6 adapters for all the popular phone models. I showed my Dad and he wanted one (since he is a truck driver and on the road a lot), so I gave him mine and decided that I'll order myself a new one on my own time. Well, after ordering from the same seller (and from the same Amazon page which indicates that it is the same item I purchased previously). I am extremely disappointed with the drop in quality. While Anker does offer my color varieties than previously, they exchanged the original travel bag with a small mesh bag, which doesn't feel the same and isn't large enough to hold the various adapters you may need plus the Astro mini itself. They also no longer include all the adapters for the popular phone models, so the only thing you get is a micro USB to charge the device (but you need an A/C wall convertor to charge it within a reasonable time). I don't have a problem with needing a separate device to charge it via the wall, but removing all the adapters means you have to purchase a convertor for each type of phone which is a hassle (might not be rated to work) and will not fit in the travel bag. With my previous purchase, I've had at least separate occasions where I let my friends use my charger, because I knew that I had an adapter regardless of the phone. That is no longer the case, plus even if you bought the adapters, the travel bag isn't big enough to hold them, which hurts the portability of it.

{"review": "There is a lot to like about this charger. 1st and foremost, it is amongst those few chargers that both clearly indicate what types of devices it will charge and supports the vast majority of both Apple and Android devices. This is a lot more rare than many realize, as it is impossible, without some sort of switch/configuration, to have one port on a charger that supports both Apple products and Android products. This charger goes the route that a few others have and allocates one port to Apple products and one to Android. This is great for flexibility, and while when the idea was first introduced I thought it was a great solution, over time I've grown somewhat disappointed with it. My family, like most families, have settled into being a one-OS family (Android in our case). So what good does that 2nd port, which only supports Apple, do if all my devices are Android? Yes, I know that I can use special \"charging cables\" to make ports designed for Apple products work well with Android devices, but personally I find that a weak solution. It means I have to carry two different types of cables on a trip, one for an actual USB connection to a PC and one for charging. I'd rather not have to do that. This charger also has another new feature, one that I've only seen on one other charger, the PowerGen 15W charger. Most multi-port chargers, even those who support different devices on different ports, use one voltage converter to power all the ports (called \"bridged\" from this point forward). The downside of a bridged solution is that if one device pulls too much power, the other device suffers. This device has two entirely independent converters, so if one device pulls a lot, it will have no effect on the others. Kudos to Anker for taking the lead on that. The downside for this device is that both ports do not have the 2.1 amps of current I would like to see, that the most power hungry devices require. The Apple port is spec'ed to 2.1 amps, but the Android port is only spec'ed to 1.5 amps. This means that people with 10\" Android tablets won't be pulling the full power they could, even if the other device is only an iPod. The bridged products don't suffer similarly. However, it is worth noting that this device is better than the one other device that has it, which only has two 1.5 amp ports. As for whether this delivers on its specs, my power draw testing passed with flying colors. The USB spec is that the voltage shouldn't dip below 4.75 volts. The 2.1 amp port was at 4.81 volts when I was pulling nearly 2.2 amps. The 1.5 amp port held at 4.90 volts even when I pushed beyond 1.6 amps. This makes this the best performing charger I've tested. As an added bonus, when I did push the unit significantly beyond it's amperage specs, the ports went into auto-shutoff preventing damage to the device, yet another positive for this device. I had two minor dislikes for me personally: It doesn't support the HP Touchpad (I recognize few of you will care) and it doesn't have a power LED. I know some will like that, as they don't like the distracting light, particularly at night. For me however, I prefer a light (not too bright of course) so that I know the device is working (or at least claims to be). Overall, for people with an iPad and an Android phone, or an iPhone and a 7\" Android tablet, or a her iPhone and his Android phone, or an iPhone and a lower power device (less than 0.5 amps) or is willing to buy a \"charging cable\" I think you'll be happy with the device. Not only does it deliver a lot of current, its good construction and compact size also are positives on its side that you'll like. For me personally, this will replace my 15W bridged device from PowerGen for when I have one Apple and one Android device, but I'll keep using the 10W bridged device from Bracketron for when I've got two Android devices or am lugging around my HP touchpad. For device manufacturers, if you want my coveted 5-star rating, this is what you have to do: 1. Deliver 2.1 amps to both ports 2. Make each device configurable (a small switch, etc.) to be either Android or Apple 3. Have good ergonomics/quality/compact size like this Anker 4. Support the HP Touchpad (OK, you don't really have to do that, but I'd really appreciate it anyway) Notes on the devices I tested with: -HTC Evo 4G LTE - showed \"AC charging\" -Kyocera Rise - showed \"AC charging\" -LG Optimus S - showed \"AC charging\" -4th gen iPod Touch - charged correctly -HP Touchpad - didn't charge correctly -Breadboard with cut cables, power resistors and a fluke DVM used for power draw/voltage tests Full disclosure: Anker shipped/gave me this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback.", "id": 3545231011}

{"review": "I own a few Anker products and have always been very happy with the proucts they make and the service they back them up with. Then I bought this car charger. The first was DOA. No current supplied out of either port. OK... This happens from time to time. Its an $11 product, I'll return it and buy another one. The second arrived and worked as advertised (almost). I measured the output it was producing and it peaked right at the documented level on each port. It charged an iPhone 5s, HTC EVO 4g LTE, Nexus 5, and an iPad 2 at the same level (mA) each device charged at on it's own supplied charger. Furthermore, it did all of this without having to worry about whether the android devices were connected via a charging (data pins shorted) or data cable. I would be writing a stellar review if this product didn't emit a shrill whistling sound that tore through my soul. If I wanted to drive around rounding up stray dogs whilst charging my electronic devices, this would be just the item I needed. My favorite part of the whole ordeal? Anker was nice enough to email me upon the first return and ask what had gone wrong and how they could better serve me as a customer. I wrote back telling them about the two chargers, the issues i had with each, and a couple of related questions and they responded with... Well... Nothing. No response. Hey Anker, I dont know what happened over there, but clearly the focus has shifted from providing great products and service to maintaing your online reviews. Maybe if you took care of the former, the latter would work itself out. Update: Anker did end up getting me a charger that worked. It took a couple of tries but I finally have a solid product. It was a hassle at first, but once i had theor attention they did get me a working product and they did it quickly from that point forward. I have since bought one other anker product and had a great experience with that item. Perhaps this was a fluke occurance.", "id": 3545231011}

I wrote back telling them about the two chargers, the issues i had with each, and a couple of related questions and they responded with... Well... Nothing. No response. Hey Anker, I dont know what happened over there, but clearly the focus has shifted from providing great products and service to maintaing your online reviews. Maybe if you took care of the former, the latter would work itself out. Update: Anker did end up getting me a charger that worked. It took a couple of tries but I finally have a solid product. It was a hassle at first, but once i had theor attention they did get me a working product and they did it quickly from that point forward. I have since bought one other anker product and had a great experience with that item. Perhaps this was a fluke occurance.", "id": 7230294011}
{"review": "I own a few Anker products and have always been very happy with the proucts they make and the service they back them up with. Then I bought this car charger. The first was DOA.

{"review": "I really like Ankers latest high powered 18 watt, Car Charger. It's performance is exactly as stated by Anker, and I love the sleek highly polished and elegant white finish that it comes in. The charger is extremely well built, and it has its 2 sides done In a lighter shade of grey. It fits my hand perfectly, It feels ergonomically designed, and it sits in my hand as if designed personally for my grip. It looks great. It works very well, and it is compact and sturdy at the same time. . It doesn't have to be shoved into the charging port. this charger glides right into the port, holds itself very firmly once seated in the port, and slips back out easily once I am done using it. I use these 12 volt car chargers very often at home, as well as when I am driving. It is very useful to have around the house. A friend of mine showed me his Wagon brand AC wall adapter with a Cigerette Lighter port on its other end. I loved the idea of it. So I bought 3 of these, and they work incredibly well. This way i can use these car chargers anywhere in my house and I also don't have to constantly grab AC power cubes and also a bunch of car chargers for when I am out in the field doing residential installations all day. I tested this Anker product. A good car charger that delivers an actual 18 watt power supply is very rare. This Anker car charger has two ports which are elegantly marked by using a wonderful etching outline that clearly demarcates the Apple Port and the Android Port. The Apple Port in the instruction manual is rated at 2.1 Amps at 5 volts. And the Android port is rated at 1.5 Amps at 5 volts. If you are like me and use only Apple IOS Devices there is no need to worry. The instructions clearly state that as long as your iPhone has IOS 5 or higher it will charge at full power levels in the Android port. This means that I can now charge, simultaneously, without overloading the charger, both my IPad 2 AND any of my IPhones. So this is what I tested for to see if this was true in real world conditions. I plugged the Wagon adaptor into my watt measuring device which is called a Kill-A-Watt meter. It actually is pretty accurate meter. The meter goes into the wall outlet, the Wagon Cigerette lighter adapter is plugged into the Kill a Watt meter, and then I plugged the Anker 18 watt car charger into the Wagon adaptor and the meter. With my IPad 2 plugged into the Apple marked 2.1 Amp port, my watt meter reported 10.7 watts being used. I then also plugged into the Android 1.5 Amp port my IPhone 4S which has a higher IOS system then the required system 5, and I checked my meter and it was reading about 16 watts with a 1/10 of a watt fluctuation occasionally. I left both my IPad 2 and my iPhone 4 plugged into the Anker charger until my Iphone charged to full. ( About an hour ) They were both charging at their listed specs rate as stated on Apple's Website. My IPad capacity level rose as usual in that hour. The Anker 18 watt car charger was not even WARM. When I came back in an hour later with both devices charging at their usual rates of charge, I thought the car charger would be hot like so many others get. But this one was room temperature. Simply amazing. The product performance outdid its own rated numbers that Anker assigned to it! It is easily one of the best performing car chargers available. Maybe the best one. It is so very useful if you work away from home or out of an office all day, in order to keep your devices topped off and constantly charged, it is very convenient and very well designed. It's highly polished white gloss finish is very attractive and also makes it easily findable, and this is very important for me. It is lightweight but with no trade off on specs. And it easily and fully charges one IPad 2 and one iPhone at the same time without producing noticeable heat. I am very happy with my new charger. I like Anker's products because they all last for a long time, they stand up to being dropped occasionally, and they are all very well designed. I am and will be using this charger a lot and am very impressed with its overall performance and design.

{"review": "I've had this only for a week and it appears to charge my phone fine as I expected. I didn't, however, expect the cord to be so short. Unfortunately, since the DC outlet I use is in my center console storage box, the coiled cord is barely long enough to extend out of the box for me to plug in my phone. If you're using the dash DC outlet, the cord may be long enough. The wire also appears thin and flimsy, very unlike the robust coiled wire of the Motorola charger it replaced.

{"review": "I purchased this product based on the hope that it could provide maximum output for my iPad while simultaneously charging an iPhone. I compared it to the Scosche USBC202M Dual 10 Watt (2.1A) USB Car Charger and the USAMS Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 3.1A. To test these chargers, I connected an iPad (3rd generation) with a depleted battery operating at maximum brightness with the GPS being actively used. I measured the amperage from each charger to the iPad using a PortaPow USB Power Monitor. Here's what I found: The USAMS dual charger (which advertises 3.1 Amps) couldn't charge at more than 0.925 Amps on either port. The Anker dual charger (which advertises 3.6 Amps max, and a 2.4 Amp port) maxed out at 1.8 Amps for the Apple port and 0.928 Amps on the Android port. The Scocshe dual charger (which advertises dual 2.1 Amp ports) maxed out at 1.92 Amps on either port. The Scocshe was the clear winner. The Anker port marked \"Apple\" provided 0.1 Amps less than the Scocshe. The Android port was unable to provide more than 1 Amp, which is fine for an iPhone but not enough to charge an operating iPad without the battery continuing to decline. The USAMS charger is clearly mislabeled because neither port could provide more than 0.925 Amps. I understand that non-Apple devices may require different ports for purposes of drawing maximum power. My review only reveals the results of testing with an iPad.", "id": 3545231011}

The Scocshe dual charger (which advertises dual 2.1 Amp ports) maxed out at 1.92 Amps on either port. The Scocshe was the clear winner. The Anker port marked \"Apple\" provided 0.1 Amps less than the Scocshe. The Android port was unable to provide more than 1 Amp, which is fine for an iPhone but not enough to charge an operating iPad without the battery continuing to decline. The USAMS charger is clearly mislabeled because neither port could provide more than 0.925 Amps. I understand that non-Apple devices may require different ports for purposes of drawing maximum power.

{"review": "It's VERY difficult to find a quality car charger, even if you're willing to shell out a lot of money, especially if one needs >1A output. This one delivers two reliable ports of >2A for a very decent price. In addition, the device screams quality in all physical aspects, snapped in perfectly into my old car (which rejected many other cheapo chargers) and shows no bright, annoying LED light. I bought it to charge a Nexus 5 and it worked very well using both the attached wire and another microusb wire I plugged into the port. Even charged two modern Android devices at full speed, which is great. Would take off a bit for the twisted attached micro-usb connector. It's small and coiled very tightly, resulting in a very taut cable that is next to impossible to use anywhere except right next to the charger. I plugged a normal 3ft cable into the other port and used that while navigating, keeping the coiled cable as backup for an occasional secondary device that can be charged while in a cup holder. This isn't enough to take away from the rating, especially given how hard it is to find a decent charger.", "id": 3545231011}

{"review": "I purchased this to replace the many chargers that I usually have to bring for my gadgets. I mainly use a speaker, a Bluetooth headset, a phone, a tablet and an iPod Classic. I have other gadgets but these are the main ones. Just right for the 5 ports of the charger. And I was in charging bliss. Or so I thought. Turns out, 2 months later, two of the ports have stopped functioning, and I'm worried that the others will break down if I continue using them. I only use the charger during weekends when I travel far from home and I use my standard chargers on weekdays. Needless to say, I am very heartbroken and disappointed. I cannot recommend the product. My father-in-law wanted to buy one also but I shall dissuade him from doing so. Please think twice before making your purchase. Update 1: I was contacted by Anker and was sent a replacement unit with their upgraded hardware. Will begin my stress testing in earnest and will update this review accordingly. I granted another star for this review because of the swift and diligent follow-ups. The first unit I purchased on the other hand has only one port left that can charge my gadgets. Perhaps it's only a matter of time now before it fails completely. Update 2: tested the replacement by connecting 5 different gadgets to it. They charged quickly and so I set on draining them to test the charging again later on. After 18 hours, I set up my gadgets for charging again. Lo and behold, the 3rd port wouldn't charge! I switched my phone to other ports to see if they were okay but shortly after, the 5th port stopped working! This is ridiculous! Unless there is a way to reset the circuits somehow, I'm inclined to keep the rating or revert it to one star. So very, very disappointed!", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "I carefully researched chargers and choose this one knowing that others had reported issues with ports failing. I choose this model for its ability to handle multiple devices but also for the Anker name as I've been pleased in the past with the build quality and performance of other Anker devices (chargers & battery packs). So after 1.5 months of light use (never all 5 ports at once), imagine my disappointment when ports 2 & 4 failed, followed quickly by port 5. In 48 hours, I went from being able to charge 5 items to just 2. I've only used OEM cables and tried each cable in each port. I can verify without a doubt that the issue doesn't stem from the cables nor the devices being charged. An important feature for a charger is its robustness. I expected more from an Anker product as I've been pleased with my other Anker purchases. Update1: Anker's customer service contacted me within hours of my posting this review and offered to ship a replacement unit. The unit is on its way to me and I intend to more carefully observe when the ports fail or what conditions lead to those failures. As I had mentioned, I was aware of other reviewers' issues with dead or failing ports, but I had factored that in my choice of charging unit (charging speed vs reliability) and my choice of vendor (Anker's customer service is highly rated). Update2: Anker issued a replacement unit to me at no cost and within very reasonable time. While I was disappointed to have the unit partially fail when I counted on it (during travel), I am very impressed by Anker's commitment to customer service and as far as I'm concerned will continue to shop for their products.", "id": 2516700011}

{"review": "These refills are ok. The system works pretty well at reducing odors...but I just can't cope with the idea of continuing to spend $7-11+ for four bags (which is what we get from each one of these refills). I decided to try buying kitchen-size trash bags with an odor-block feature. I put the kitchen bag down through the chute and tuck the top around the top of the area that you open to install an official refill. Then when the whole thing is full, instead of tearing the bag and knotting it to start a new one, I just take the old bag out and put a new bag in. Turns out it works fine. When the diaper genie is full it is the equivalent of 1/2 a kitchen trash bag! Since I bought the kitchen bags specifically for the diaper genie, I don't feel like I need to fill the other half of the bag to get my money's worth or something...but, just saying, each of the official refills basically holds less than two kitchen trash bags worth of diapers. For $7-11+. So, with the official refill you're spending $1.75-2.75 per bag, and you have to do the awkward cut and tie with a full bag of diapers, but it looks a little prettier because no portion of the bag is exposed outside the system. With Hefty 45 Count 13 Gallon Cinch Sak® Tall Kitchen Bags E86755 you're spending .17 per bag, and it is less awkward, but it is not as pretty because top of the bag shows outside the system. I guess it just depends on what is important to you, but we'd much rather have the top of the bag show and get 10 times as many bags for the same price. This also means that we don't have to remember to buy bags often at all. We just bought a box of 45 bags and it's lasting quite a while.", "id": 166768011}

{"review": "I have a newborn and just finished my second refill. She is 6 weeks old. I know how many diapers I've been through because I've tossed almost all of her diapers at home (still don't get out much). I'm just starting a 5th case of 88 newborn diapers. That means I've gone through 4 cases of 88 each = 352 diapers. 352 diapers in 42 days = 8-9 diapers a day (that sounds about right). Anyway, my point with the above calculation is that I got about 175 diapers in each refill. Not at all 270. Maybe they packed them airtight - but through normal use, I think it's far less than 270. And of course, once she gets into larger size diapers, it will be even fewer. So what does this mean? Based on current pricing, it means I'm paying another 3.5 cents PER DIAPER for my diaper genie. And that's newborn size. If you are someone sitting there calculating your per-diaper costs, you may not think much about what it costs you to toss it. Then again, even at 3.5 cents per diaper, you're still talking about maybe 30 cents a day. That's worth it to me. I like my diaper genie a lot and I do find these refills convenient. But if you tend to look for ways to get that 19 cent diaper instead of 22 cents or whatever, this adds a lot (relatively) to the cost. Might want to try the regular trash bag trick that another reviewer mentioned.", "id": 166768011}

{"review": "These were a perfect fit for our diaper genie Elite. I don't know what people are talking about that these aren't the same thing because they look exactly the same as the ones that originally came with our diaper genie from Babies R' Us. We had no problems with them fitting and they are far cheaper to purchase on Amazon than they are in our local stores. I will definitely buy them again. Just make sure your buying them for the right Diaper Genie specified and you should have no problems. EXTRA $$$$ Saving HELPFUL TIP: To get the most use out of these I don't use the cutter mechanism on the diaper genie because I was noticing that it wasted too much of the refill. Instead I keep a pair of scissors nearby and cut it when the bag needs changing. These really extends the life of my refills. I am getting a good 3-4 weeks or more out of each refill by doing this.", "id": 166768011}

Just make sure your buying them for the right Diaper Genie specified and you should have no problems. EXTRA $$$$ Saving HELPFUL TIP: To get the most use out of these I don't use the cutter mechanism on the diaper genie because I was noticing that it wasted too much of the refill. Instead I keep a pair of scissors nearby and cut it when the bag needs changing. These really extends the life of my refills. I am getting a good 3-4 weeks or more out of each refill by doing this.", "id": 2358141011}

{"review": "Length:: 0:51 Mins I loved Pampers Swaddlers when my daughter was a younger infant, but when she started crawling, I dutifully switched to cruisers halfway through her stint in size 3 because I felt like I was \"supposed to\" now that she was actively moving. Overall I've been happy with cruisers. She was in Cruisers size 3 and then size 4 during the day, and Huggies Overnight at night (she was soaking her cruisers at night, and Huggies Overnights are definitely the best!) I've had the chance to compare the Swaddlers to the Cruisers in size 4, and I can see the differences when I look at the diaper itself. The Swaddlers are more padded (thicker), whereas the Cruisers have a strong elastic. And of course the Swaddlers have that yellow/blue stripe to tell you when the diaper is wet. Personally I don't really need that stripe at my daughter's current size. The days of teaspoon-sized pees in stationary babies asleep in a crib are long gone, and if she's wet, I kinda know. Swaddlers: Thicker, Yellow Stripe Cruisers: Thinner, more elastic Both: Perfect for my long & lean 13 month old - no leaks (21 lbs ... I move up diaper sizes early) Neither: Neither is great for overnight for a toddler who actively soaks a diapers. But that's why there are overnight diapers! Overall I can't say I have a preference between the two. If you love swaddlers and/or really want the stripe, then stick with swaddlers and don't worry that you should move to cruisers because your baby is crawling/walking. If you use cruisers and are happy, don't let the fact that you can get swaddlers in size 4 make you question which is better. In my opinion there really isn't much of a difference. The Swaddlers are just as good for my very active 13 month old. Choose your diaper on price or on the cartoon character on the front or whatever you care about. I really don't think there is functionally much of a difference between Swaddlers and Cruisers.", "id": 166772011}

{"review": "We have been Swaddler fans since day 1 and currently in size 5. Target was the only store to carry the size 5 until recently. I was excited to see that Amazon and other stores would be carrying the size 5 when Target placed their boxes on clearance. Apparently they went on clearance because a newer version was taking it's place! The newer Swaddler, in my opinion is simply horrible. First the packaging and character strip is different. Obviously those things are not a big deal, however the inside now has a mesh lining, what they call the \"absorb away liner\". When wet or dirty this liner stretches, sags and sticks to the skin. This liner does not wick away the moisture or protect the skin at all!!! We never let our son sit in a dirty diaper, we are constantly changing him when the strip turns blue so this isn't a matter of not changing often. Since the newer Swaddler our son has suffered diaper rashes and his skin is so raw and red. We have since switched to something better for us.

But the new Swaddler, is awful!!!! 1) The diaper has a weird chemical smell instead of the nice baby powder smell. 2) Now the diaper sags even when it's not very full. 3) The liner does not wick away the moisture at all. My daughter's bottom is always shining with wetness from her urine and I change her frequently....so much that my mother and my mother-in-law tell me to chill out. My daughter has only had 2 small diaper rashes since she was born & one blowout, and since the new Swaddler she has suffered recurring diaper rashes, and they are severely red & multiple near blowouts even with small bowel movement. 4) Pampers has increased the price by reducing the # of diapers per box. I have stopped my Subscribe & Save subscription from Amazon. I just got my last shipment and I will be returning them. I am terribly disappointed. Please change them back and I will purchase them again!!!", "id": 1297811011}
{"review": "I have been a loyal Pampers customer since 2010 and have tried other brands, but always returned to the Pampers Swaddlers! I tell new moms not to even bother trying huggies or Luvs (Junk! Great commercials but crummy diapers) and to ONLY use pampers, especially swaddlers. However, in the past couple weeks my son has been having horrible blow outs (Top of the diaper) so I was thinking he needed to be in a size up (he’s in a size 4), even though he is perfectly in the weight range. However, he has also been suffering from extreme diaper rash, so bad he would shake when we wiped him, and the cream that always worked in the past didn’t even help: For him and my older daughter (who only used pampers) RARELY had diaper rashes, either very tiny and gone with a touch of cream but these bad rashes are now so common and come to realize, only since our most recent shipment of pampers arrived in February. After reading other reviews and putting the pieces together, these \"Improved Changes\" are awful and my son gets to suffer:( and I get to do more laundry... And like other unhappy customers, there really aren’t many options of better diapers, which is SAD...Pampers should go back to their original QUALITY product, as I am going to start shopping around and find a better (non diaper rash creating) fit for my son.", "id": 166772011}

{"review": "My husband and I had bought enough of the old version of size NB and size 1 Swaddlers to last us about 5 months. They were fantastic - not one complaint. I raved about Pampers and recommended them to all my friends. Then, about a month ago, we ran out and had to order the new version. Every single day, our daughter came home from daycare in a different outfit than we sent her in because poop leaked out the back of the diapers. We switched from size 1 to size 2, hoping that would alleviate the problem. No such luck. I randomly decided to read reviews on here today. Apparently this is a problem for a lot of people with these new and \"improved\" diapers. As soon as we make our way through the diapers we have, we will be looking for a new brand of diapers. And I'm sure Pampers is going to respond like they did for every other 1 star review and tell me to call and provide more information. No thanks. Just take the advice of many unhappy customers on here and go back to your original diapers. What ever happened to the old saying, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it?\"", "id": 166772011}

{"review": "My daughter is almost 6 months old and since she was born, I've had the opportunity to try hundreds of brand-name diapers that were given to me at my diaper party. These diapers ranged from Huggies, Pampers, and Luvs. Within the Huggies & Pampers line, I had different \"models\" at my disposal, such as Pampers Swaddlers & Pampers Baby Dry as well as Huggies Little Snugglers, Huggies Snug & Dry, and even Huggies Snug & Dry Plus. However now that I've run out of those, I am now purchasing my own diapers. Based on my experiences, Pampers Swaddlers are ***THE BEST*** diaper I've used thus far. And because of that, I will never go back to any other diaper. I've literally given my unused packages/boxes of Huggies diapers to local charities for those in need. The reason I love Pampers Swaddlers is that they are the *ONLY* diaper that does not leak. The fit absolutely perfect and I've never had an issue with them. EVER! However, this is not to say that all Pampers diapers are good. I've tried Pampers Baby Dry, which is a more economical version of their diaper, and that diaper does not come close to the performance of the Swaddlers line. Baby Dry would would leak and/or sag to cause more leakage. The Huggies brands however, are even worse. I can't tell you how many times my daughter's daycare had to change her clothes due to constant leakage of the diaper (EVEN WITH 2 hour change intervals). Huggies is simply garbage because it soaks up literally nothing. I'm left to wonder if various boxes of the Huggies diapers I've used even has any sodium polyacrylate in them. FYI, sodium polyacrylate is the \"super absorbent polymer\" that absorbs moisture in all brands of diapers. While Pampers Swaddlers would \"bulge up\" and absorb my daughter's urine, the Huggies line never bulged up. Meaning they never absorbed anything. Leading to the urine-soaked clothes that my daughter experienced every day. The color-changing wetness indicator is a nice touch. The equivalent brand version of Huggies that has this is the Little Snugglers. But just as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, it leaked and never seemed to fit right on my baby. Although I'd pull them up as high as they could go, there seemed to be a huge \"pocket\" around my baby's bottom, which would be one of the reasons for the sag/leakage. Another reason I like the Pampers Swaddlers is their shape allows for a snug fitment. Pampers is the only diaper with \"tags\" on both ends to provide a 360 degree full fitment around the waist. No other brand of diaper I've seen does this. The Pampers Swaddlers line goes all the way up to size 5. I'm glad because it's the only diaper that I trust. So I'll be buying these until my daughter grows out of them. I stand by my review 100% and have NEVER been disappointed by the Swaddlers line.", "id": 166772011}

Another reason I like the Pampers Swaddlers is their shape allows for a snug fitment. Pampers is the only diaper with \"tags\" on both ends to provide a 360 degree full fitment around the waist. No other brand of diaper I've seen does this. The Pampers Swaddlers line goes all the way up to size 5. I'm glad because it's the only diaper that I trust. So I'll be buying these until my daughter grows out of them. I stand by my review 100% and have NEVER been disappointed by the Swaddlers line.", "id": 1297811011}

{"review": "We have used Pampers Swaddlers diapers since my baby was born. We used sizes P-S, then 0, then 1, and then 2, and had no problems at all. In fact, we thought Pampers compared favorably to other brands we tried. When the time came to order size 3, we of course purchased Pampers Swaddlers once again. The package arrived very quickly and sat in the corner while we finished our remaining supply of size 2 diapers. We thought we noticed a scent of baby powder (which we don't use) but it was only when we finally opened the size 3 carton that the stench filled the room. The baby powder scent was very very strong, but not strong enough to cover up the acrid smell of chemicals. Horrible horrible odor! We started sneezing, the baby started sneezing. Our noses started to run, our eyes got watery. We moved the Pampers diapers to the garage and went to our local Whole Foods to purchase a small pack of eco-friendly diapers, which seemed so overpriced compared to Pampers. But once the size 3 Pampers were out of the house all symptoms of allergic reaction ceased almost immediately. So we trashed the Pampers. Very disappointed that we have to look for another brand now. UPDATE: We have now tried several other diaper brands in size 3. We even returned to Pampers one time, hoping that the box we had a problem with was an exception, not the rule. But we are now using Target's home brand in size 3 and, surprisingly, are quite satisfied with them. Compared to Pampers, they feel \"cheap\" and pretty basic. But with the Target brand we've had no problems with diaper rashes, had only one pee leak incident (compared to several with Pampers), and had no incidents with poo blow-outs (which happened frequently with Pampers). Plus, the Target brand is about half the price of Pampers. Would have never guessed that's what we'd end up using, but experience has shown otherwise. One more comment...

{"review": "It's so hard to find Elsa and Frozen merchandise that isn't a knock-off or that isn't marked up 3 or 4 x the original price! Moms and dads - here's what you need to do to avoid those knock-offs and make sure you pay the suggested retail price: go to Amazon, and type in \"Elsa Amazon.com\" and this will ensure that your results are from Amazon.com, and not a third-party seller. Amazon.com sells all the products at the manufacturer's suggested retail price (or lower), and they are genuine. It took me several tries (over different days) before Amazon.com finally had some of these dolls in stock. They were gone pretty quickly, and after they were sold out, all that was left were the dolls from the third-party sellers. Have patience - you never know when Amazon will get a shipment from the manufacturer. Based on reviews, it seems there's a substantial risk that the third-party sellers are either offering cheap knock-offs or they are the mean people who snap up all the Frozen merchandise at the toy store (or on Amazon) and then turn around and re-sell them on Amazon for crazy prices. Let's all boycott these meanies! When I finally got this doll (genuine, from Mattel) at the normal price, I felt like I won the lottery. Elsa's dress does not have sleeves or bodice (instead they are painted on her arms and body) but she is beautiful for the price (just under fifteen bucks). Her face is beautifully painted and her hair and clothes were immaculate. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Elsa's shoes actually fit, and stay on. Overall, I am so happy I was able to give this to my three-year-old daughter without having spent a fortune.", "id": 3245219011}

{"review": "I'm a grown man and for years I've wondered why we wash our babies butts butt not our own after a #2? I started using wipes about 5 years ago and there's no way I'd ever go back to the partially clean feeling that you get from TP only. This mondo package of wipes was a good value, half the price of the retailer.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "My biggest surprise when opening the package was 3 HUGE wipe bags...in the past I usually get bags of 70-80 or so. They do have a zip-lock seal...but knowing how fast these things dry out I put my open one in a 5 gal zip-lock bag. They are perforated (like toilet paper) rather than tri-fold....so each piece is connected to the next...making it extremely hard to pull it out of the slot on the wipe container. We have resorted to opening the lid entirely up and grabbing the length that we need. These wipes seem thinner than the Sam's Club, Pampers or Target and tear very easily. I had a coupon so at 1cent/unit/piece it was about 50% less than what I pay for the other brands I mentioned. Haven't decided if the savings are worth it.", "id": 677974011}

{"review": "I have used Huggies for many years and always loved them. I ordered this 648 refill pack because I thought it was a good price deal, but the Huggies are NOT the same! This is a box of three refill bags of 216 wipes each, and each bag is exactly the same height as a refill of 184 wipes that I bought elsewhere. Which tells you what? That these wipes are THINNER! In fact, it took 5 flimsy wipes to do the job that one used to do! Remember when Huggies filled that plastic dispenser box? Now there is plenty of extra room for the wipes to flop around in there because they are shorter, narrower, and thinner! Hey, manufacturers, we customers would rather have to pay MORE than see our favorite products get skimpier and skimpier for the same price, whether it's Huggies, breakfast cereal, or candy bars.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "These wipes are great at wasting time and wasting themselves, that's about it. I don't have time while wiping a child's rear to worry about carefully pulling up on the wipe so it does not tear, just enough so that the next one comes out the top, since these have a habit of falling back into the container. If that happens you would think you could just stick a finger in there next time and grab the chain again like every other brand.... NOPE, stick a couple fingers in that dispenser and you'll first put giant holes in the paper thin wipes and also come out with just a torn fingerful of the top layer. Useful for sure while the child kicks at your groin and sticks their foot into the dirty diaper while you tear off the lid of the dispenser. But be careful, if you pull too hard while dispensing you get 15 wipes bunched together from poor folding design, and careful don't pull too far or you will dry out the next one. Also useless is the perforation. Who needs double sized wipes? How large is the child's behind?? Just take two, its more sanitary than dragging a gigantic chain of deformed, holey, simply-clean-wipes through the mess, tearing as they go so your hand gets covered in poop. Purchased in the \"resealable bags\" these are a huge pain to refill as they don't fit by the bag in their own provided container and you know you have plenty of spare time to eyeball that and tear off a moist pile of wipes then reseal a cheap zip lock carefully. Hey just put the entire bag in your diaper bag. Its only 500 wipes or so, takes up half the bag and weighs 5lbs. Very convenient. But do these wipe poop well? If they stay in one piece they are about as useful as wet toilet paper, and they didn't cause a rash for us. So if you have time to spare and those are your standards go wild, buy em.", "id": 677974011}

Everyone's children are a little different but these were quite harsh on my baby's skin.

{"review": "I am not brand loyal to Pampers, but lately I have been trying them out because of the new redesign. I used to prefer Huggies because they are unscented, but lately the powder smell of Pampers hasn't bothered me. I have tried all 3 new redesigned diapers and here is what I think. Swaddlers: The best of the 3. They are the softest. They have the mesh-like liner. They absorb a TON of pee. My son drank 3 cups of water before his nap the other day and woke up dry, even though his Swaddler was hugely swollen. They are mostly white and don't show through clothes. I love the wetness indicator strip. They have white tabs that blend in with the diaper. Even though Cruisers are slightly more stretchy and thinner than Swaddlers, I don't have any problems with these not being stretchy enough for my very active 15-month-old son. They never leak on us. Cruisers: The 2nd best of the 3. They are still very soft. They are thin. They hold a lot of pee and don't leak. I don't care for the designs because they are very \"busy\" and show through clothes. They don't have the mesh liner or wetness indicator. Some people probably don't need these features, but I find them useful. They have white tabs. They are just a tad bit less expensive than Swaddlers. You can buy Cruisers Ultra in some places and those do have the mesh, but I think that might be the only difference and they cost more than regular Cruisers. Baby Dry: Still good diapers but clearly the cheapest and most cheaply made of the 3. They feel papery on the outside and they are thin. They work just fine, holding the pee just as well and are a great economic choice if you want to use Pampers. The design on them is also very busy, and shows through clothes. Green tabs. All three are great, as I imagine Swaddlers Sensitive and Cruisers Ultra also are. I don't have leaks with any of the three (we don't use any of them at night, we use Huggies Overnights) and I have no fit issues with them either. My son is 25 lbs. and 32.5 inches tall at 15 months, so he's on the large size. The size 4's offer plenty of coverage. Bottom Line: I would buy these Cruisers again. I think they are pricey but doable with coupons. I don't care for the characters, so I have knocked off a star. I wish diaper companies would stop making us pay more for characters on the diapers. My son doesn't see the diaper anyway when it's tucked into pants, and he doesn't care either way.", "id": 166772011}
{"review": "We've been loyal Pampers customers since our child's birth. Used Swaddlers from birth, and once he grew out of those, we moved to Cuisers. We've used Cruisers for the past 5 months or so, without incident. Hence, the surprise and disappointment when we received our latest subscribe and save shipment. These new diapers are night and day contrast to what we previously purchased. We've had 5 leaks in 2 weeks! Up until this purchase, we had maybe 2 leaks with pampers! This has never happened in the 14 months of our son's birth. The new diapers feel very thin and rougher than the old version. As others have mentioned, the tabs are inexplicably white. The designs have been updated, but our package has only 2 alternating designs, versus the 3/4 from prior purchases. Finally, the new upgrades now mean fewer diapers per box (although price has increased). I'm really disappointed with Pampers; I don't understand how an upgrade to a product translates to lower quality and value. We've cancelled Subscription.", "id": 166772011}
{"review": "I am now on my third child, and I've pretty much tried all diapers there are to try, including cloth (which we love as well). I keep coming back to Cruisers when I need disposables because they never leak, they have a soft scent that seems to keep my diapers from stinking in the trash, and they fit well. I love that the tabs rarely break and they are thinner than those on other brands because my babies have chunky bellies that seem to get chaffed by thicker tabs. However, yet again, we consumers are paying the same price for less diapers! The box I ordered on my subscribe and save last month has eight more diapers in them than the new packaging has. Personally, I'd rather have the old box with more diapers than pay for a redesigned box with less diapers. And while I am complaining, I'm not a big fan of the Sesame Street characters and I wish they would go with something different more like the design on the Swaddlers Sensitive diapers. And bring the mesh liners back to Cruisers; breastfeeding poop tends to be really runny and those liners actually help absorb some of the mess! (10/6) I just wanted to update that we have gone through almost a whole box of these now and there is something about the fit that is off. My little one is still roughly the same height and weight as he was at the start of the month (30 inches and 28 pounds) and the Size 5 are so tight that I am thinking we may have to switch to size 6. The diapers are actually leaving marks him, yet they still come up high on his back and belly so I am not understanding how the fit is so off. If they were too small, one would think they would get and shorter, yet this is not the case. The odd thing is, I have bags of Baby Dry size 5 and they still fit him fine. The Cruisers seem really rigid and almost rubbery compared with the Baby Dry and I am wondering if that is not the problem. The diapers, since the addition of the new added absorbency stuff back a few years ago, just do not have the same stretch and give that they used to. I also have had more than a couple of leaks in these at night where I have not had that happen before. I still like Pampers but I feel like we need to shop around to see what else might be out there to fit better for our chunky guy.", "id": 166772011}
{"review": "I don't know exactly what changes P&G has made to these diapers and frankly I don't care how many research interviews they conducted, what I do know is that I'm sick and tired of our 16 month old leaking poop down the inside of his legs.

For one, there are there over a dozen less per box now. Not a huge deal, but it all adds up in the end. The big deal: they are way less effective than they were before the 'improvements' took place.

We now also have issues with the tape (never had that before), we have leaks regularly (also rarely ever occurred previously, as we change quite often due to sensitive skin and mentioned amount of fluids we drink), just like when we tried the store brand diapers... The 'feel' of them also appears more 'plastic-y' compared to the nice soft feel before... I'm sorry to say our experience is the exact opposite of all that was communicated via ads to have been improved.

My baby freaks out over the slightest dampness, it was a huge relief to be able to go hours between changes.

I noticed the design was different from the first ones, so I come on here and look for more info just to see all these reviews saying the same thing. Pampers, get your act together. Amazon, sorry, but now I'm buying them from local store that haven't sold through the previous version.

{"review": "I'm really not seeing a lot of difference between these Pamper Baby Dry's, and the previous iteration. Fewer per box (I'll address that below). Pampers is simply the best out there. Superior fit, elastics, fasteners, absorbency, softness. The only better diaper to my knowledge is Pampers Swaddlers. The Swaddlers seem a bit softer, although these Baby Dry's are still soft, and by no means what we would call plastic-y, as one reviewer maintains. Price: I'm a grandparent and received this box via the Vine program. However, my daughter (the babies' Mom) is a regular purchaser via Amazon Prime, so I feel qualified to comment on price. So there is a lower diaper count in this new Baby Dry package. Pampers spokespeople maintain that this is because of the added absorbency element. I'll accept that as a truthful, reasonable explanation. I'll also accept that at some point Pampers will no doubt have to eventually raise their price - just like the price of taxes, postage stamps, health care, coffee, and so on. I don't like it, but I do appreciate that Pampers continues to produce a superior product at what is still a reasonable price. I hope this family is out of the diaper years by then. Pick your own diaper price range. As for ultimate product quality, these diapers are exceeded only by Pampers own Swaddlers line. No choice but 5 stars.", "id": 166772011}

So go ahead and add 20% more \"content\" to your response than you've written to the other upset former customers!", "id": 1297811011}
{"review": "This is a new listing for what is essentially the old pampers baby dry diapers just with less diapers in the package. The manufacturer claims to have raised the amount of absorbent material in the diaper by 20% but I can not see any improvement in the diapers, perhaps that is because I never had a problem with the level of absorbency in the baby dry diaper before so an increase in absorbent material does nothing to improve the product. What this does do is allow give the company a reason behind their reduction in the number of diapers in the package while charging the same amount. So what the consumer is left with is a diaper which still does an adequate job of absorbing moisture but now we have less of them for the same price. Our family has always used Pampers diapers since day 1 (our baby's but has never known another brand), unfortunately after this change we will no longer be able to say this since we will be auditioning other brands. I can not say at this time that we will swap brand but pampers has our confidence and given us reason to try to find a suitable replacement.", "id": 166772011}

Ridiculous I know, but are we paying extra for the stupid pictures? Now for the real issues - the leg elastic seems to disintegrate the moment my toddler moves even when his diaper is dry, and the stretchy material attaching the tapes to the diaper shred when I'm putting the diaper on. I have wasted so many diapers due to these new and improved materials that the cost has nearly doubled for me. Also, my laundry has multiplied as the gaping leg holes don't keep him dry anymore, luckily his clothes are absorbant.

{"review": "This little \"radio\" is very cute. My 7 month son loves pressing the buttons to turn it on and change the music and he likes the lights too. However, it does end up on the floor a lot! LOL - Even my 4 1/2 yr old daughter loves it! The music is classical music that you know from the Baby Einstein videos. The volume is a good level and not annoying at all. The music is soothing and you don't get sick of hearing it like some other baby toys. I would recommend this toy.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "My daughter was fascinated with this toy starting at about 6 weeks of age when absolutely no other toy interested her. She would stare at the lights for minutes on end, and, as us mothers know, at this young age, a content baby for several minutes and be a miracle. We went on a road trip when she was just over two months and this was a life saver. I highly recommd this product.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "We took this toy with us for a three hour car ride with our 1 year old son, and it kept him entertained for at least 1-2 hours. He kept pushing the button each time a song ended. It's not extremely loud, so it's not obnoxious to parents. I will probably take this with us on our next plane ride. It's nice and small, too, so it fits into a purse, diaper bag, or tote bag very easily.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "I bought this toy for our son when he was about 2 months old. He was fascinated from the moment he saw it. It was too heavy for him to hold at the time so i'd hold it for him or prop it up against something while he watched, completely mesmerized. 6 months later, this is still his favorite toy. We take it everywhere - to restaurants, on the plane, anywhere where he might get bored and make a fuss. It always calms him down and isn't so loud that it will disturb other people. I would love it if there were one higher sound option because in loud restaurants, it's a little hard to hear. But the lights still play and that's enough to keep him interested. Also, for younger infants, it would be great if the music and lights played a little longer so the parent wouldn't have to press the button so often. But even without those improvements, it's a definite 5 star item!", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "music is not loud or annoying when you take it out with you but enough for the little one to appreciate. it has been a lot of things; a chew toy, musical toy, educational toy, accessory, and lately a hammer. although the light bulbs gave out already my baby still likes it. i have also given this out as a gift, and only good feedbacks so far.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "Received at my shower. Used it almost immediately. My son is coming up on his 1st birthday and he still loves the toy. The lights would calm him down when he was in a giant fit when he was very little and now he enjoys pressing the button for the changing tunes :) I read through some of the 1 star reviews out of curiosity and I have to admit that the problem that most of them mentioned - the chewing off of the sticker - was a problem...of sorts. My kid didn't choke on it and I just didn't freak out about him swallowing a bit of it so it didn't bother me. If the sticker didn't come off, I would have given this 5 stars. There aren't too many toys that have grown with and kept the interest of my son for this long. Take along tunes and Sophie Giraffe are the only two. Oh, yeah, that and a used egg carton. He loves that freaking egg carton! :)", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "I've bought several small toys in the hopes of keeping my 11 month old son entertained when we go out for dinner or even a stroll. Many of them end up in the corner of his playpen after he's grown tired of them 5 minutes in. This toy is different - he will play with this for a long time - it really keeps his attention. Maybe it's the music AND flashing lights, but he just loves this toy. I attach it to his stroller with a sippy cup strap so that when he drops it (or throws it), it doesn't make it to the ground. I would give it 5 stars if it played more songs (I think it has 4-5 songs), but I would definitely recommend it either way. Another toy I would highly recommend is the Mozart Cube - that is another invaluable toy that keeps my son's attention much longer than any other toy. And the music is nice - not annoying like so many toys can be.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "We bought this toy on a whim... to qualify for free shipping by exceeding the $25 mark on Amazon (just being honest). I've had good luck with Baby Einstein toys, etc in the past. The music is of good quality... not at all distorted or too loud... and it comes with all the \"usual\" baby songs (can we get some variety or what?). The lights are especially dazzling in darkly lit areas... not so much in bright rooms or outside during the day. It's very basic (just one button to activate both lights and music) and my 9 month old daughter seems to get bored with it rather quickly, but I'd definitely recommend it for younger infants or perhaps as a toy for \"the quick grocery trip\" or to attach to a stroller. In my opinion, it's too basic for infants beyond about 6 months and it could be much more interactive. Other than that, it's of good quality and worth it for the small price tag.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "The first thing my baby did was to drop this on the floor. It resulted in one of the melody having some weird feedback, but nothing too major. Lovely music, but wish that there are more pieces to rotate with. The button is not that easy for little fingers to press, would be great if it is build with soft fabric like Leapfrog musical counting pal. As some reviewers have mentioned, the hard plastic means that we have to watch our babies in case they smack their face/head while playing with it. I also found it a it puzzling that the speaker is at the back of the toy, if I place it on the mattress or mat, the music get muffled.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "My 6 month old son loved this toy ever since he was 2 months old. When he's fussy in the car I just give this toy to him and he calms down immediately! There are two volumes so if we are in the car I turn it to the highest volume and if we're in a public place or my office I just turn it down. The songs are long enough that they grab his attention for a few seconds. He loves to look at the blinking lights that play along with song as well. I feel this will be a toy he will enjoy for a while.", "id": 196607011}
{"review": "Here is my completely honest review. Luvs are decent diapers. Both my kids went similar routes with diapers. I'd start with the cheapest diapers i could find, but once they started rolling/crawling I would upgrade to luvs. No, they didn't stop every leak, but they were cheap.. and there were a lot of them. I could easily get away with spending ONLY 10-15 bucks a month on diapers with Amazon Mom and S&S. Unfortunately the amount of diapers in the box has gone down TWICE in the last 2 years. For example my size 3 used to be 234 count.... Then it dropped to 204 count... Now its 186 count. Am I missing something? Are babies pooping less? The price for the boxes have remained steady the last couple years. Most of my deliveries have been around 25 bucks. So before you jump and buy these, Double check amazon.. As of this posting, you can get the 204 count size 3 for 11 cents LESS than this box.", "id": 166772011}

I could easily get away with spending ONLY 10-15 bucks a month on diapers with Amazon Mom and S&S. Unfortunately the amount of diapers in the box has gone down TWICE in the last 2 years. For example my size 3 used to be 234 count.... Then it dropped to 204 count... Now its 186 count. Am I missing something? Are babies pooping less? The price for the boxes have remained steady the last couple years. Most of my deliveries have been around 25 bucks. So before you jump and buy these, Double check amazon.. As of this posting, you can get the 204 count size 3 for 11 cents LESS than this box.", "id": 7230259011}

{"review": "We have been using Luvs for the last 15 months starting with N to now Size 4...This was our 5th case of Size 4 (the previous 4 were the 180 box). Where do I begin... First - Quality. The previous version of Luvs, we had no complaints with. They were in fact thicker than the current \"improved\" version. We NEVER had leaks at night and it lasted 10pm-6am. Ever since we switched, we have had leaks EVERY night. We have now set an alarm for 2 AM so we can change the diaper!! The quality has dropped to Parent's Choice (Walmart) levels. Second - False advertising. The new 160 count is NOT their biggest box. You can still buy the 180 count right here on Amazon!! It used to be even bigger before! Third - Price. Not only did they reduce the count, they decreased the quality and increased the price!!! Adios Luvs...it was fun while it lasted... Hello Kirkland/Huggies...you are now in the same price range... I will be calling the Luvs customer service to exercise their leak proof guarantee. I would recommend all of you do the same. UPDATE - DO NOT CALL THE NUMBER THAT THE SHILL BELOW IS POSTING.

I ended up having to change his shirt and pants THREE times yesterday!!! Seriously, since we received this most recent box, I have done twice as much laundry. Here are some of our recent specific problems: - The tabs on the new diapers are shorter and don't fasten to front of the diaper as well. They seem to pop open at random times. - FOUR times now, he has full on \"leaks\". I can't even call it a leak in the traditional since since the diaper was bone dry. Rather the diaper has pulled away from his inner thigh and urine ran straight down his leg (this wasn't a case of the tabs opening or coming loose at the top either, they were secure). Two of the four times it happened overnight. - Countless regular leaks out the top of the diaper now, since the absorbent strip goes all the way up to the belly button now (which is why I am changing his shirt as often as his pants). This type of leak happens at least once every other day. Sometimes twice. Yesterday three times. - Small diaper rash bumps now too. Never had that problem with the old Luvs. - I personally don't think they hold any more than they used too. The diapers themselves are far thinner, so I feel it just spreads the urine out farther up his front and back. - And lets talk about the crinkle sound. Holy much louder now. - And that crinkle used to be a good thing. If there was a crinkle noise, he was still dry. The new diaper crinkles equally loud if it is wet or dry. And you know how you can just put your hand down there and \"feel\" how wet they are. Well not anymore. Unless they are plum full and soaking wet, you can no longer tell by just touching them through their pants. And then to add insult to injury, they've once again lower the diaper count and decided to charge us more for an inferior product. I wasn't happy went the boxes went from 168 to 150. But now 140 and charging more money for a worse product is aggravating. I haven't decided who we will be switching too.... but it's not going to be Luvs anymore. And since Pampers and Luvs are made by the same company (Procter & Gamble) I have a real hard time paying them even more money by switching to the overpriced Pampers.

Back then, the sponsor was Blue's Clues and the quality of the diaper itself was way up there with the Pampers brand. Never any dampness on my baby's behind! My selling point was the price, but most of all, the ability to have a dry backside on my children. There were never issues with leaking diapers at night! Fast forward 10 years. Year 2013. I have another baby in diapers and had to learn the hard way that LUVS aren't what they used to be. More than once do I have to change a diaper, day or night, because of leaking through the side band, and not enough 'soaking up' on the pad part of the diaper. My child's behind stayed damp to the touch up until the next diaper change. Frequent diaper changes don't help. Believe me, I've tried. It's not worth the money, even though much cheaper compared to Pampers. I wish the makers of LUVS wouldn't have skimmed on production costs with using lower quality material.

Back then, the sponsor was Blue's Clues and the quality of the diaper itself was way up there with the Pampers brand. Never any dampness on my baby's behind! My selling point was the price, but most of all, the ability to have a dry backside on my children. There were never issues with leaking diapers at night! Fast forward 10 years. Year 2013. I have another baby in diapers and had to learn the hard way that LUVS aren't what they used to be. More than once do I have to change a diaper, day or night, because of leaking through the side band, and not enough 'soaking up' on the pad part of the diaper. My child's behind stayed damp to the touch up until the next diaper change. Frequent diaper changes don't help. Believe me, I've tried.

{"review": "If you are considering switching to Luvs after August 2013, be aware they have 'updated' them. Buy a tiny pack, or borrow some from someone else first. I've been using them for a year and the quality has sharply declined recently. Luvs was my diaper of choice. Huggies was my gucci name-brand diapering favorite, but there was no reason NOT to buy the Luvs. They were cheaper and worked just as well. But starting about 3 months ago I noticed an increase in leaks. A big one! From no leaks at all to one or two per DAY. Overnight leaks became a guarantee. I thought it was just me. I tried a new box of Luvs - same problem. My next clue something was wrong was when I saw a coupon for Luvs (Luvs never has coupons) in the Sunday paper - sharing a Pampers ad! That's unusual. Apparently they are both P&G companies. Which is fine. I don't care who makes them, as long as they WORK. But why would P&G mess with something that wasn't broken? Now as I write this I see all the fresh one-star reviews. This used to be a 5-star product! Apparently we all currently agree on the almost instantaneous degradation of quality of our favorite diapering underdog. What a shame. There are quantity issues as well. The number of diapers per box is slowly dwindling as the price holds firm. And the company writing \"BIGGEST BOX\" on the new smaller sizes is just comical. Nice use of 'Memory Hole' P&G! It is 1984 all over again. \"Diaper rations will not fall below 20g!\" \"Diaper rations have been increased to 15g!\" Good luck with that. My mom memory is bolder than your font. UPDATE 2014: My \"new Luvs\" are the Target brand diapers, but I encourage you to try all the brands and find the one that works for YOUR child. Maybe it will be Luvs! After the Luvs failed we tried all the brands and really they weren't all that different. Hell, P&G probably makes them ALL, so just go with what works.

Shouldn't the box say \"cheaper quality yet more expensive?\" Since we have gotten our new box of Luvs from Amazon, we have had leaks every single night that my baby has worn these diapers, and we do not need to size up according to weight recommendations. Not even close. It's the diapers that are leaky, and they did not leak before! Whoever is responding here keeps stating that they have been improved, the design has not changed, the absorbency has been increased, they are not thinner etc. Please, listen to what the reviewers are saying--we have noticed a difference and it is not good!!! I am not the only one who is listing the same problems with these diapers. My child used to go the entire night without a need for a diaper change. But since we got our new box of Luvs diapers, every night around 2-4 am, I wake up to my son screaming, cold and soaked in his own urine. I have to change his pajamas, then change his sheets and blankets, and then try to put him back to sleep and go back to bed myself...if I can. This is not user error, the diapers do not need to \"breathe\" before putting them on, and they are not the wrong size. Quite simply, the quality is poor and the absorbency is decreased, not increased. I really trusted Luvs and thought them to be a great value, but now they are just awful...what happened to a trusted brand???", "id": 1297811011}
{"review": "* Not our biggest box. Hopefully these complaints resonate with the manufacturer. Luvs is knowingly trying to fool customers by putting this label on the box. Why would you put such a huge statement on the box when you knowingly reduced the size of the box? How about a sticker saying \"Now with more profit\"? I've used Luvs for my daughter for the past year. It was an economical brand with quality, I can't still say the same. I can no longer support a company that does not respect their customers. I urge others to do the same, the only way to change companies these days is through our wallets.

{"review": "This is NOT the biggest box ever!! I started with 168 pack of size 5 and within a month or so it was done to 150. Now it's down another 10 but the price has barely changed. In fact it went up from the 168 to 150, and slightly up from 150 to 140. How does that make sense!? I understand the product may be improved, but paying Subscribe and save customers shouldn't be forced to choose the box with less for more. Sadly this remains the cheapest option, but I'd rather see the prices reflect the shrinkage of the product. Sorry Luvs, giving this item one star because of Amazon's poor treatment of it's loyal customers and the false advertisement.

{"review": "I came across these by accident. I don't have any Fit & Fresh containers so I can't tell you about how well they work with those but I do pack lunches for my 3 kids. I like these because they're thin. I can put one on the bottom of a lunch box (we have soft-sided ones from Lands' End) and put a milk box, sandwich, and fruit cup on top of it. Previously I'd have to figure out how to wedge one of those blue bricks in between all the items that needed to stay cold. These are made out of hard plastic so they stay flat of course...I'd tried the soft ice packs but I could never get all 3 to freeze perfectly flat each time. The kids tell me their lunches are still cold at lunchtime so the ice packs are working. The ice packs only have to keep cool 3-4 hours at most anyway. If you're packing lunches for your kids and tired of the bulky blue bricks, get these. They work so much better.", "id": 13900811}

{"review": "These 'Cool It' ice packs are designed similar to the Rubbermaid Blue Ice Block but are better sized for insulated lunch bags or lunch totes. DESIGN: Individual ice pack is approx 5\" square and about ¾\" thick, so it fits well in those smaller insulated lunch bags/lunch totes or personal coolers. Each ice pack has a small 'donut hole' in the centre of the square so the frozen ice pack can circulate the cold air freely in the lunch bag/lunch tote. WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT THESE 'COOL IT' ICE PACKS? They are made of antimicrobial hard plastic with the non toxic blue gooey stuff safely on the inside ... unlike Blue Ice Bags which works fine but puncture over time - especially in kids lunch totes :)) I freeze the ice packs overnight. Usually, two ice packs are enough for my lunch box - one for my soda and, another for my cold sandwich or fruit salad. The ice packs are designed to use with the Fit & Fresh Lunch on the Go container. However, I simply place one of the 'Cool It' ice packs underneath my Food Container - it works great! CON: These 'Cool It' ice packs are not sweat-free. As the ice packs melt, they do sweat a little in my lunch box. I don't find this a problem, but I have a quick fix nevertheless! TIP: To make these re-freezable ice packs sweat-free, simply wrap individual ice packs in a sheet of paper towel before placing in the luch tote. Bounty paper towel works fine ... and of course, it's re-usable! Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)", "id": 13900811}

{"review": "I wanted to try out this product for the \"skin/hair care\" side of it, though this product is \"pure\" enough that a little in my soup or skillet creates a nice nutty aroma and mild taste - really good in this coconut curry soup I eat. That said, I brought the jar into my bathroom to keep it there instead of for cooking (I'll purchase another one for the kitchen). The one negative I have with this product for skin is that it's so thick and hard, I really have to dig in there to get a bit; however, once it's in the palm of my hand, the warmth of my skin melts it quite quickly. It can feel a little heavy and greasy at first, and the scent of coconut makes me think of cooking and not \"beauty product;\" but I mixed it with a little of my regular hand/body lotion and that was the ticket - it smoothed on my skin quite nicely and created a kind of \"sheen\" like those starlets have on their skin as they walk the red carpet with an insipid grin. Mixing it toned down the coconut scent, too. I did smooth it on my face, straight, and it did absorb quickly, and the scent of coconuts wasn't so strong after a few minutes. I have slightly sensitive skin with a little rosacea and the product didn't break me out or irritate my skin. But! The best \"beauty\" use I had from this product that SOLD me, is what it did to my hair! One morning I smoothed the coconut oil on my hair, paying particular attention to the ends. I threw my hair up in a ponytail and left the coconut oil in for at least an hour and a half. I rinsed it out with very warm water and then I shampooed twice. When I stepped out of the shower, I realized I was going to be late for an appointment. I quickly combed my hair, dressed, jumped into my car, and let the opened windows dry my hair, every so often shaking it out and combing through with my fingers -- I couldn't believe it! by time I reached my appt 35 minutes away, my hair was soft and smooth - even with the wind hitting it - no blow-dryer - no brushing it out - when I returned from the appt - again the windows open blowing my hair all over creation, I brushed my hair and it was so soft and shiny and smooth. That sold me -- if I don't use this product for anything else, it's worth it for how it made my hair look and feel! UPDATE! - I bought another container of this to use in the kitchen - omg! If you saute shrimp in it, you not only have the aroma of coconut, but the shrimp taste incredible! I also fry or scramble eggs with it - mmmmmm - this stuff is amazing.", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "I use a lot of extra virgin coconut oil, so much that I usually buy the Nutiva 2-pack of 54-ounce jars. I tried Vitacost's and didn't like it as much as Nutiva, so I've stuck with the Nutiva and really had not planned to switch brands. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Viva Labs product, I agreed but was doubtful I was going to be swayed. Well, let me tell you, when I opened up this coconut oil, I was amazed at the difference. This is an extra virgin coconut oil I could actually imagine myself taking by the tablespoonful, as was recommended by several health books my sister shared with me for people suffering from candida albicans infections. I've used my Nutiva for popping popcorn, cooking, and for skin care, but now I'm thinking I'll just use up the Nutiva for frying and go straight for the Viva Labs version for everything else. There's just no contest. A great use for this coconut oil is as a butter replacement on toast. My Nutiva spreads and melts like one of those margarines that take a long time to melt; the Viva Labs spreads like softened butter and melts like a dream. Price-wise, I've been spending about 47 cents an ounce for the Nutiva when I buy it in the big bulk pack. I was thinking that, at almost 62 cents an ounce for the 15-ounce container, the Viva Labs was more expensive—although I'd have to say it's worth it. But when I went to cost out some of the other Nutiva products, they ran as much per ounce if not more than the Viva Labs product. I'm impressed enough that I'll be switching.", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "Viva Labs' Coconut Oil was offered to me free for review and I loved it! It comes in a plastic jar and can be a liquid or a solid depending on the temperature of your home. When I received it, it was a liquid, so I put a little in a squirt bottle (for the shower - see below), but the next day it was a solid because of the temperature inside my home - I just ran the bottle under some warm water and it quickly liquefied so I could squeeze it out. After receiving my Viva Labs' Coconut Oil, I ventured out onto the web to see what I could use it for and wow! There are loads of different ways to use coconut oil: * Cooking * Baking * Skin Care * Hair Care * Aromatherapy * Kitty Cats (put it on their paws to reduce hairballs and promote a shiny coat) * Google it and I am certain you will find a million ways to use it! So, how did I use it? In the kitchen: I was thinking that it would only be good in dishes that were sweet, but it doesn't have a sweet taste at all. I actually fried an egg with it and I couldn't tell that I didn't use regular oil. Coconut oil has a high smoke point, so frying an egg was totally fool-proof and I did notice that it didn't spatter all over the stove like vegetable oil does and my favorite thing about it was that my kitchen didn't smell like fried food for days - which is one of the main reasons I never fry anything! Shower: I always use baby oil (while my skin is wet) as a moisturizer, so instead of my baby oil, I switched it up and started using the coconut oil. A little bit goes a long way, but it soaks into the skin quite nicely and left me feeling silky smooth with no greasy feeling and it smells delicious! Makeup Remover: I also use baby oil to remove my waterproof mascara, so I used the coconut oil and it worked like a charm! Exfoliator: I also used it as an exfoliator on my hands, feet and body - mix it with a little sugar while you are in the shower. It is an inexpensive way to get rid of that dry and flaky skin and again... leaves you with silky smooth skin. I saw that you could use it as a deep conditioning treatment on your hair - it works there too - I smoothed A LITTLE on my hair and left it overnight and then washed it out in the morning. My hair was nice and shiny and didn't look greasy at all. My hair is super short, but I could imagine that a person who might really notice a difference would be someone with long hair who battles with their hair being dry and or frizzy would really notice a difference. Finally, you can use it as a sexual lubricant - yes, well, you know! It wouldn't be a \"Bookie Nookie\" review if I didn't bring something naughty into it! There is ZERO sugar in coconut oil - which is a common concern when using \"food\" products that are sweet in or around those girly parts (sugar in THAT area can cause a yeast infection o_O). There were no issues with that and definitely reduced the friction and helped things glide quite nicely :-D Viva Labs' Coconut Oil is definitely a product I would use again and I would and have recommended it to my friends. At around 11 bucks for a 16-ounce jar, it's affordable and has a million uses - you have nothing to lose by checking it out. ✳✳ Product provided by Viva Labs for an honest review.", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "Well, the wife and I have been using coconut oil for about a year. I think it was Dr. Mercola who tuned us into investigating and using coconut oil for its many health benefits. You can google for a list of benefits and other reviewers on Amazon have done a pretty good job of outlining most of the benefits so I am not going into all that again. I am a guy and I do not like to put greasy \"stuff\" on my face or hair. So, I do not use it as a moisturizer or in my hair. We use it only for eating. So, that is where I will concentrate my opinions. So, we use coconut oil for its health benefits from eating it, although I have put some on cuts and scratches and found it to be very soothing. It seems to aid healing. I have never gotten an infection from any cut after putting a little coconut oil on it with a bandage and the cuts heal fast. There is a misconception that coconut oil is not good for heart health. This is because it contains a large quantity of saturated fats. In reality, coconut oil is beneficial for the heart. It contains about 50% lauric acid, which helps in actively preventing various heart problems like high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. The saturated fats present in coconut oil are not harmful as you commonly find in vegetable oils. Coconut oil does not lead to increase in LDL levels, and it reduces the incidence of injury and damage to arteries and therefore helps in preventing atherosclerosis. Coconut oil is also good for the immune system. I have read that it strengthens the immune system because it contains antimicrobial lipids, lauric acid, capric acid and caprylic acid which have antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties. According to the Coconut Research Center: \"The vast majority of the fats and oils you eat, whether they are saturated or unsaturated or come from an animal or a plant, are composed of long-chain triglycerides. Probably 98 to 100% of all the fats we eat consist of LCT. Coconut oil is unique because it is composed predominately of MCT. The size of the fatty acid is extremely important because physiological effects of medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are distinctly different from the long-chain fatty acids more commonly found in our diet. It's the MCT in coconut oil that make it different from all other fats and for the most part gives it its unique character and healing properties. Almost all of the medium-chain triglycerides used in research, medicine, and food products come from coconut oil.\" \"Have you or someone you know ever been in a serious car accident? I mean serious enough that you had to be rushed to the hospital and spend time in the intensive care unit. Or maybe you've come down with a life-threatening illness. Or perhaps due to age you've been hospitalized to treat some degenerative condition. In any of these situations, whether you lived or died depended on the care you received in the hospital. Often this required you to be fed intravenously or through a tube. In the intensive care unit there would be others, some suffering from complications from genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or epilepsy and perhaps even premature infants struggling to survive their first few weeks of life. In each of these cases you and these other patients can give some of the credit for your recovery to coconut oil. Yes, in one form or another, coconut oil was part of your treatment.\" \"Regardless of the condition, recovery requires good nutrition. Food scientists have long noted the nutritional benefits of medium-chain triglycerides. MCT from coconut oil are used in hospital formulas to feed the very young, the critically ill, and those who have digestive problems. It makes up a vital part of the solutions fed to patients intravenously or through a tube inserted down the throat. If you were ever given formula as a baby you took advantage of the health-promoting properties of coconut oil. MCT from coconut oil have been added to baby formula for decades.\" \"MCT are easily digested, absorbed, and put to use nourishing the body. Unlike other fats, they put little strain on the digestive system and provide a quick source of energy necessary to promote healing. This is important for patients who are using every ounce of strength they have to overcome serious illness or injury. It's no wonder why MCT are added to infant formulas. Actually, whether you were breast or formula fed as an infant you consumed MCT. Why? Because MCT are not only found in coconut oil but are natural and vital components of human breast milk. MCT are considered essential nutrients for infants as well as for people with serious digestive problems like cystic fibrosis. Like other essential nutrients, you must get them directly from the diet.\" \"One of the first scientifically recognized benefits of MCT is the unique manner in which they are digested and utilized by the body. These fats provide nutritional benefits that can improve overall health of both the sick and the well, the young and the old. Even athletes are now using them to boost performance and control weight. Unfortunately, few foods nowadays contain MCT; the best source is coconut oil. By adding coconut oil to your diet you can literally eat your way to better health.\" So, it is information like this that got us to buying coconut oil and using it for baking/frying. For a newcomer, you will notice the coconut flavor right away when you bake or fry with it. It takes some getting used to. Now that we have been using it for a while, we have gotten to like it. I like to buy the 32-oz size when I buy it in the store because we go through it pretty fast and bigger is better. Most coconut oils taste about the same so we just look for the best buys. Most of the coconut oils I run across say they are organic and virgin. So, it comes down to which we like the taste of best and how expensive it is. I don't always go for cheap - I have to like the taste too. I received a 15-oz. container from Viva Labs free in return for an honest review. I was able to do a side-by-side test of this brand and a couple others I have in the house. What I like about the Viva Labs coconut oil is that it seems to be lighter in the coconut flavor. It is rich and creamy and doesn't have that coconut kick that some of the other brands have. You can still taste the coconut when you fry with it, it just isn't so in-your-face. I use it to fry potatoes for breakfast as that is one of my wife's favorite breakfasts. I also use it in place of butter to make cobblers. I make a cobbler topping by mixing oats, brown sugar and coconut oil until the mix is in small crumbs and then put it on top of the fruit filling - cherries, apples, peaches, etc. The coconut flavor actually adds a lot to a cobbler. You can use it for pie crust instead of lard/crisco. Coconut oil is expensive no matter what the source. The 32-oz container I usually buy at the store runs me $35 which is over a dollar an ounce. That makes this 15-oz container from Viva Labs at under $10 a good buy. So, we have been using coconut oil for about a year now. I used to have at least one bad cold a year, an ear infection at least once a year, and usually a case of the flu or similar every year. I don't know if it is the coconut oil, but this is the first time I can remember going a whole year without ever being sick. Not a cold, not a sniffle, no sore throat, nothing. I can't say it is because of the coconut oil, but since coconut oil has become part of our lives here, we continue to use it and enjoy whatever health benefits we can gain from using it. I like this brand and will continue to use it in our household.", "id": 11060691}
{"review": "Well, the wife and I have been using coconut oil for about a year. I think it was Dr. Mercola who tuned us into investigating and using coconut oil for its many health benefits. You can google for a list of benefits and other reviewers on Amazon have done a pretty good job of outlining most of the benefits so I am not going into all that again. I am a guy and I do not like to put greasy \"stuff\" on my face or hair. So, I do not use it as a moisturizer or in my hair. We use it only for eating. So, that is where I will concentrate my opinions. So, we use coconut oil for its health benefits from eating it, although I have put some on cuts and scratches and found it to be very soothing. It seems to aid healing. I have never gotten an infection from any cut after putting a little coconut oil on it with a bandage and the cuts heal fast. There is a misconception that coconut oil is not good for heart health. This is because it contains a large quantity of saturated fats. In reality, coconut oil is beneficial for the heart. It contains about 50% lauric acid, which helps in actively preventing various heart problems like high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. The saturated fats present in coconut oil are not harmful as you commonly find in vegetable oils. Coconut oil does not lead to increase in LDL levels, and it reduces the incidence of injury and damage to arteries and therefore helps in preventing atherosclerosis. Coconut oil is also good for the immune system. I have read that it strengthens the immune system because it contains antimicrobial lipids, lauric acid, capric acid and caprylic acid which have antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties. According to the Coconut Research Center: \"The vast majority of the fats and oils you eat, whether they are saturated or unsaturated or come from an animal or a plant, are composed of long-chain triglycerides. Probably 98 to 100% of all the fats we eat consist of LCT. Coconut oil is unique because it is composed predominately of MCT. The size of the fatty acid is extremely important because physiological effects of medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are distinctly different from the long-chain fatty acids more commonly found in our diet. It's the MCT in coconut oil that make it different from all other fats and for the most part gives it its unique character and healing properties. Almost all of the medium-chain triglycerides used in research, medicine, and food products come from coconut oil.\" \"Have you or someone you know ever been in a serious car accident? I mean serious enough that you had to be rushed to the hospital and spend time in the intensive care unit. Or maybe you've come down with a life-threatening illness. Or perhaps due to age you've been hospitalized to treat some degenerative condition. In any of these situations, whether you lived or died depended on the care you received in the hospital. Often this required you to be fed intravenously or through a tube. In the intensive care unit there would be others, some suffering from complications from genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or epilepsy and perhaps even premature infants struggling to survive their first few weeks of life. In each of these cases you and these other patients can give some of the credit for your recovery to coconut oil. Yes, in one form or another, coconut oil was part of your treatment.\" \"Regardless of the condition, recovery requires good nutrition. Food scientists have long noted the nutritional benefits of medium-chain triglycerides. MCT from coconut oil are used in hospital formulas to feed the very young, the critically ill, and those who have digestive problems. It makes up a vital part of the solutions fed to patients intravenously or through a tube inserted down the throat. If you were ever given formula as a baby you took advantage of the health-promoting properties of coconut oil. MCT from coconut oil have been added to baby formula for decades.\" \"MCT are easily digested, absorbed, and put to use nourishing the body. Unlike other fats, they put little strain on the digestive system and provide a quick source of energy necessary to promote healing. This is important for patients who are using every ounce of strength they have to overcome serious illness or injury. It's no wonder why MCT are added to infant formulas. Actually, whether you were breast or formula fed as an infant you consumed MCT. Why? Because MCT are not only found in coconut oil but are natural and vital components of human breast milk. MCT are considered essential nutrients for infants as well as for people with serious digestive problems like cystic fibrosis. Like other essential nutrients, you must get them directly from the diet.\" \"One of the first scientifically recognized benefits of MCT is the unique manner in which they are digested and utilized by the body. These fats provide nutritional benefits that can improve overall health of both the sick and the well, the young and the old. Even athletes are now using them to boost performance and control weight. Unfortunately, few foods nowadays contain MCT; the best source is coconut oil. By adding coconut oil to your diet you can literally eat your way to better health.\" So, it is information like this that got us to buying coconut oil and using it for baking/frying. For a newcomer, you will notice the coconut flavor right away when you bake or fry with it. It takes some getting used to. Now that we have been using it for a while, we have gotten to like it. I like to buy the 32-oz size when I buy it in the store because we go through it pretty fast and bigger is better. Most coconut oils taste about the same so we just look for the best buys. Most of the coconut oils I run across say they are organic and virgin. So, it comes down to which we like the taste of best and how expensive it is. I don't always go for cheap - I have to like the taste too. I received a 15-oz. container from Viva Labs free in return for an honest review. I was able to do a side-by-side test of this brand and a couple others I have in the house. What I like about the Viva Labs coconut oil is that it seems to be lighter in the coconut flavor. It is rich and creamy and doesn't have that coconut kick that some of the other brands have. You can still taste the coconut when you fry with it, it just isn't so in-your-face. I use it to fry potatoes for breakfast as that is one of my wife's favorite breakfasts. I also use it in place of butter to make cobblers. I make a cobbler topping by mixing oats, brown sugar and coconut oil until the mix is in small crumbs and then put it on top of the fruit filling - cherries, apples, peaches, etc. The coconut flavor actually adds a lot to a cobbler.

{"review": "I recently stumbled across a pretty helpful health & wellness blog. I had already tried, and was well impressed by, several of their health tips (or life hacks) when I stumbled across the \"Oil Pulling\" article. For those of you who haven't heard of oil pulling, \"it is is an ancient Ayurvedic remedy for oral health and detoxification. It involves the use of pure oils as agents for pulling harmful bacteria, fungus, and other organisms out of the mouth, teeth, gums and even throat.\" At first I was confused by the concept and kind of disgusted by the thought of swishing oil around my mouth for a lengthy amount of time. The experience just didn't sound appealing at all but I figured, why not try it? I am in my late 20's now and didn't start taking oral hygiene very seriously until a few years ago so my teeth and gums can use all the help they can get. I have been oil pulling for a couple of weeks now and am glad I decided to give it a try. It is now part of my morning routine while I shower and get dressed and definitely before eating or brushing my teeth. Some people warm the oil up before putting it in their mouth to liquify it but I just take a spoonful of the oil as it quickly liquifies in the mouth. I have yet to see any differences in the color of my teeth but I do believe that my teeth feel healthier. Flossing has also become easier, which I assume is due to some of the layered oils before removed from the surfaces of my teeth. If you do purchase this coconut oil for oil pulling, make sure you do enjoy the taste of coconut. It has a very strong and sweet coconut flavor that does not fade during the process and it does leave a coconut aftertaste in your mouth as well. I wasn't a big fan of coconut flavor before but have gotten used to it through the oil pulling process. Oh, and make sure to NEVER swallow the oil after pulling. The coconut oil will contain all the bacteria and oils it pulls from your teeth so make sure you spit it out in the garage or into the sink while rinsing it down the drain with hot water.", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "First, I would like to stipulate that I am an avid Skin Ceutical consumer. I have reached my sixties, and although I have been told that \"I really look pretty good for my age\" I am like most women at this stage in that I have not escaped the inevitable fine lines and the onset of wrinkles. I chose this year to do something about this concern. First I went through a CO2 treatment to get rid of any sunspots that had accumulated over the years. Then I proceeded to use Retin A, along with a regiment of derma rolling (micro-needle therapy). I do use the Skin Ceutical Vitamin C E Ferulic Acid in the mornings, but in the evenings, after my derma rolling session I am using OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum. I have given OZ Vitamin C serum a 5 star rating for a few different reasons. 1) The OZ Vitamin C serum does NOT sting my face. I apply this serum directly after an aggressive 10 minute session of derma rolling when my face is red and the skin is slightly raw. Even the Skin Ceutical serum stung, but with the Oz serum there is only a slight tingle as my skin is tightening. 2) I have not developed any allergic rash, welts or bumps 3) The benefits of the OZ serum seem to be exactly the same as my much more expensive Skin Ceutical serum. Now, this is why I chose to try the OZ naturals serum. Before I choose what to purchase I do read through the reviews, almost all of them including any 1, 2, and 3 star reviews. What I found impressive was that in many of the lower ratings a representative from Oz Naturals would reply under comments, often encouraging any dissatisfied customers to please call and speak directly to the OZ esthetician for personal support and help with the product. Customer service like this is to be commended. This shows a willingness to listen, help, and a true belief in their product. This impressed me enough to choose OZ Naturals over the other high rated serum products. Now for the last part of my lengthy review I would like to share some tips that I have learned both from both my research and personal experience: 1) First of all, according to what I've read in many dissatisfied reviews, there is a misconception of what a face serum is used for. A serum is NOT a moisturizer. It has more of a face tightening property. A good moisturizer should be applied AFTER the serum has had a few moments to be absorbed into the skin. 2) A serum will only help in conjunction with other skin care products and your healthy life-style. You need to stay hydrated, and get enough sleep, and we all know that sun, stress and environment plays a large part in the health of our skin. Think of it as getting ready for a special event. Buying a new dress is not all that is required for the event. There are shoes, accessories, a handbag, doing your hair, maybe painting your nails, and perhaps some make-up. The same is true for skin care products, working all together should get you some positive results over time. 3) Please don't expect miracles within a few days, weeks or even months. If you think about it, a long fingernail that breaks is not going to grow the full length back in a day, nor is you hair going to grow 2 inches in a few weeks, and I think it's unrealistic to believe that someone is going to lose 50 lbs in a month. Well your skin is no different. Even with a professional face lift it takes quite a while for your face to heal and lose the numbness. The collagen in your face takes about a month for the cells to turnover. There are going to be some better days and worse days in between, but after a month you may see some small improvement, but usually so small that it's only apparent to you. However, in 4 to 6 months these monthly improvements add up to be significant for others to notice. So, be diligent in your skin care routine, and be patient. It will happen, everyone has different issues and needs and therefore experience different time periods before they see all the positive results that they are looking to receive. If you have taken the time to read through my rather lengthy review, I hope that it has been helpful, and encouraging.", "id": 3760941}

{"review": "First, I would like to stipulate that I am an avid Skin Ceutical consumer. I have reached my sixties, and although I have been told that \"I really look pretty good for my age\" I am like most women at this stage in that I have not escaped the inevitable fine lines and the onset of wrinkles. I chose this year to do something about this concern. First I went through a CO2 treatment to get rid of any sunspots that had accumulated over the years. Then I proceeded to use Retin A, along with a regiment of derma rolling (micro-needle therapy). I do use the Skin Ceutical Vitamin C E Ferulic Acid in the mornings, but in the evenings, after my derma rolling session I am using OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum. I have given OZ Vitamin C serum a 5 star rating for a few different reasons. 1) The OZ Vitamin C serum does NOT sting my face. I apply this serum directly after an aggressive 10 minute session of derma rolling when my face is red and the skin is slightly raw. Even the Skin Ceutical serum stung, but with the Oz serum there is only a slight tingle as my skin is tightening. 2) I have not developed any allergic rash, welts or bumps 3) The benefits of the OZ serum seem to be exactly the same as my much more expensive Skin Ceutical serum. Now, this is why I chose to try the OZ naturals serum. Before I choose what to purchase I do read through the reviews, almost all of them including any 1, 2, and 3 star reviews. What I found impressive was that in many of the lower ratings a representative from Oz Naturals would reply under comments, often encouraging any dissatisfied customers to please call and speak directly to the OZ esthetician for personal support and help with the product. Customer service like this is to be commended. This shows a willingness to listen, help, and a true belief in their product. This impressed me enough to choose OZ Naturals over the other high rated serum products. Now for the last part of my lengthy review I would like to share some tips that I have learned both from both my research and personal experience: 1) First of all, according to what I've read in many dissatisfied reviews, there is a misconception of what a face serum is used for. A serum is NOT a moisturizer. It has more of a face tightening property. A good moisturizer should be applied AFTER the serum has had a few moments to be absorbed into the skin. 2) A serum will only help in conjunction with other skin care products and your healthy life-style. You need to stay hydrated, and get enough sleep, and we all know that sun, stress and environment plays a large part in the health of our skin. Think of it as getting ready for a special event. Buying a new dress is not all that is required for the event. There are shoes, accessories, a handbag, doing your hair, maybe painting your nails, and perhaps some make-up. The same is true for skin care products, working all together should get you some positive results over time. 3) Please don't expect miracles within a few days, weeks or even months. If you think about it, a long fingernail that breaks is not going to grow the full length back in a day, nor is you hair going to grow 2 inches in a few weeks, and I think it's unrealistic to believe that someone is going to lose 50 lbs in a month. Well your skin is no different. Even with a professional face lift it takes quite a while for your face to heal and lose the numbness. The collagen in your face takes about a month for the cells to turnover. There are going to be some better days and worse days in between, but after a month you may see some small improvement, but usually so small that it's only apparent to you. However, in 4 to 6 months these monthly improvements add up to be significant for others to notice. So, be diligent in your skin care routine, and be patient. It will happen, everyone has different issues and needs and therefore experience different time periods before they see all the positive results that they are looking to receive.

{"review": "I'm 61 years old, have always taken great care of my skin and am no stranger to a good skin care regime but, despite all my efforts, fine (and not so fine) lines kept appearing and deepening and nothing I tried worked. A friend recommended that I try some kind of topical Vitamin C product, which was something I hadn't yet done. So I did a search on Amazon and up popped this product. I was very - and I mean VERY - skeptical but it had great reviews and a good price so I thought, \"What the hey? I'll give it a shot\". I wasn't expecting to see results for at least a month after first using it (if at all) but, to my great surprise, I started noticing a significant reduction in the depth of the lines around my mouth and on my cheeks within a week. I was stunned. I've tried all kinds of moisturizers and serums (sera?) in my lifetime and this is the first one that lives up to its claims. I'm now a total convert and will not start my day without applying the OZ Naturals serum. Their customer service is also excellent so I'd give it a six-star review if I could.", "id": 3760941}

{"review": "I suffer from hyper pigmentation caused from birth control pills. Within three months of changing to a \"new and improved\" birth control pill, I developed what is commonly known as the pregnancy mask. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to repair my skin, between Chemical peels, Fraxel laser, 4% hydroquinone cream, Tri-luma cream and blue and green light therapy. Although my skin improved, I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth. After five Fraxel treatments, I still had hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, and I finally accepted that this was something I would have to live with forever. After running out of Estee Lauder Even Skintone Illuminator, I decided to research comparative serum's. During my research I kept reading about the benefits of Vitamin C serum. Well this product was one of the highest rated and with the most reviews so I decided why not try it since I have tried everything else. I used OZ Naturals for 30 days and noticed a slight improvement to my skin. Nothing significant, but considering this was far less than what I was paying for Estee Lauder products, I decided to order another bottle. By this time, I discovered the benefits of derma rolling. The combination of a .5mm derma roller and vitamin C serum has made my skin look amazing. I still have discoloration, but it is definitely improving. So much so that one day out of the blue my husband told me that my skin looks really good. To be fair, I am going to list my entire skin care regimen. I wash my face twice a day with facial cleanser and a Clarasonic cleansing brush. Afterwards, I remove the excess soap with 100% witch hazel. I let the witch hazel dry completely before I apply vitamin C. Once the vitamin C has dried, I apply moisturizer and follow up with sun block. Two to three times a week, I use a .5mm derma roller on my face and neck. For me, combining all of these products has rendered the best results. FYI, there is no need to purchase expensive skin toner that only contains 50 - 70% witch hazel. Save the money and go to Walgreens and purchase a 16oz bottle of witch hazel for $6.", "id": 3760941}

I wash my face twice a day with facial cleanser and a Clarasonic cleansing brush. Afterwards, I remove the excess soap with 100% witch hazel. I let the witch hazel dry completely before I apply vitamin C. Once the vitamin C has dried, I apply moisturizer and follow up with sun block. Two to three times a week, I use a .5mm derma roller on my face and neck. For me, combining all of these products has rendered the best results. FYI, there is no need to purchase expensive skin toner that only contains 50 - 70% witch hazel. Save the money and go to Walgreens and purchase a 16oz bottle of witch hazel for $6.", "id": 7792515011}
{"review": "I suffer from hyper pigmentation caused from birth control pills. Within three months of changing to a \"new and improved\" birth control pill, I developed what is commonly known as the pregnancy mask. I have spent thousands of dollars trying to repair my skin, between Chemical peels, Fraxel laser, 4% hydroquinone cream, Tri-luma cream and blue and green light therapy. Although my skin improved, I didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth. After five Fraxel treatments, I still had hyper pigmentation on my cheeks, and I finally accepted that this was something I would have to live with forever. After running out of Estee Lauder Even Skintone Illuminator, I decided to research comparative serum's. During my research I kept reading about the benefits of Vitamin C serum. Well this product was one of the highest rated and with the most reviews so I decided why not try it since I have tried everything else. I used OZ Naturals for 30 days and noticed a slight improvement to my skin. Nothing significant, but considering this was far less than what I was paying for Estee Lauder products, I decided to order another bottle. By this time, I discovered the benefits of derma rolling.

{"review": "Length:: 2:10 Mins My wife decided that she wanted a flat iron hair straightener and she thought this model looked the best. When she got it and used it for the first time she was very excited. It was easy to use and she got professional results doing it herself. I have included a video on the product and show the before and after results on her hair. (Please don't make fun of her before hair photo) My wife used the temperature setting between 2/3 and 3/4 of fully turned on all the way. The model has some very good features and it really is a high quality product. Just a couple of issues you should be aware of: 1. If you plug in the flat iron and it will not come on, press the reset switch on the cord circuit breaker to reset it. 2. The unit does not have an automatic shut off timer so make sure you turn it off or unplug it. If you have children I would unplug it and store it properly away after it was cooled off. Please take the time to watch the video and I hope it is of benefit to you. Flat iron included accessories: * Nice traveling bag * Flat iron * Heat glove * User instruction manual Main Features: * Adjustable temperature from 140° to 410° F to suit your hair type. * Smooth ceramic plates that easily slide through your hair. * 1 inch wide plates to work with any hair type and style and also allow you to straighten your bangs. * Power cord is 7 feet long with built in circuit breaker * On/off switch. * Heat indicating LED light. * Fast and easy to use with professional results. * Comes with protective heat glove if you want to use it. * Swivel power cord to eliminate the power cord from twisting. * Operates on 110 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz This is a good product and deserves a 5 Star rating.", "id": 11058261}

The unit does not have an automatic shut off timer so make sure you turn it off or unplug it. If you have children I would unplug it and store it properly away after it was cooled off. Please take the time to watch the video and I hope it is of benefit to you. Flat iron included accessories: * Nice traveling bag * Flat iron * Heat glove * User instruction manual Main Features: * Adjustable temperature from 140° to 410° F to suit your hair type. * Smooth ceramic plates that easily slide through your hair. * 1 inch wide plates to work with any hair type and style and also allow you to straighten your bangs. * Power cord is 7 feet long with built in circuit breaker * On/off switch. * Heat indicating LED light. * Fast and easy to use with professional results. * Comes with protective heat glove if you want to use it. * Swivel power cord to eliminate the power cord from twisting. * Operates on 110 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz This is a good product and deserves a 5 Star rating.", "id": 1294321011}
{"review": "The only reasons I bought this flat iron was because the price was right - only $44.23 and the reviews were great. For $44 I thought it would be worth the risk of not knowing the manufacturer to go ahead and get this since it is a professional flat iron. I had been using a Chi iron. After reading several reviews on Amazon about how others had a CHI that broke, I thought it might be a good idea for me to get this as a backup in case my own CHI breaks soon. Now my old CHI is the backup and the HSI is my main one! This HSI flat iron is great. The features I love: -Adjustable temperature control -Swiveling cord so no tangles/twists -Plastic behind the heated plates does not get too hot so I can grab that part when I need to -Both straightens and curls my hair -Smooth plates, nicely constructed so my hair doesn't get caught up in it and pulled out I have very thick, curly hair and this flat iron does a quick job straightening my hair. i would recommend this product and would buy an HSI again if I had the need. UPDATE AFTER 1 1/2 YEARS My HSI flat iron is still going strong! I use it about 3 times each week as my only flat iron. It works as well as it did on day 1 and I've had no problems with it at all!", "id": 11058261}

{"review": "I was going to spend a LOT more money through HSN for a CHI flat iron with the same options as this Flat Iron and i was gonna pay 4 flex pays and each one would have cost almost as much as the total price of this item. I have VERY thick, coarse wavy hair... It is EXTREMELY resistant to any form of straightening... dry coarse texture... and ive always wanted long hair but couldnt have it without using a STRONG relaxer which destroyed my hair... left it in a suspended state of China Doll straight with NO other options... well i;ve been growing my hair out for many months.. I have had to fight it tooth and nail.. multiple salon hair cuts to tame it.. I use a LOT of straightening products and on occasion.. yuck.. strong chemical relaxers you need a gas mask and hazmat suit to use... switched to a chi smoothing relaxer.. smoothed but did NOT straighten hair.. Well i think i can TOSS a lot of that out now that i have my HSI. I put a lil of the Argan oil sample in my hair. Heated up the iron and gave it a go without overly high expectations. In 20 minutes i had my shiny, silky. and Pin straight!!! and no heat damage.. I was SHOCKED that this 40 dollar iron had all these options and worked so well I had to struggle so much with my hair before,but NO MORE!! The packaging is top notch as well.. and the storage bag is to die for. Also the Argan Oil is a MIRACLE serum... When i say miracle im not kidding.. God actually answered my years of praying for my hair to cooperate... its always been a love hate thing .. its SO much better than anything containing any type of silicone and i will be ordering a 4oz bottle of the HSI Argan Oil as a compliment for sure.. I currently use Chi Silk Serum.. while it is effective.. it does NOT come into the league of the HSI Argan Oil... it may be expensive for the oil but you get what you pay for... it doesn't take a lot.. I know my own hair texture and i can guarantee with the HSI iron it WILL close the cuticle.. make it soft.. shiny.. I haven't even used my Expensive Chi Hairspray.. dont seem to need it.. hair moves naturally and then back in place.. In the past i had to layer my hair in smoothing and holding products.. i've Never been happier with a hair tool and i've had MANY.. and i still just cant get over the price.... I'm a man but I've been in the company of a LOT of stylists and designers and h ave access to high end products.. but i hate always having to beg them to style my hair and then its gone once the nights over like Cinderella.. i pay much more for a cut and style at the salon than i paid for this Flat Iron. Also no more next day disappointment after the salon when i cant replicate what the stylist did ,, because with my HSI i CAN replicate it :) quite easily and quickly actually.. Also I color my hair EVERY 4-6 weeks... i colored my hair a week ago and i wasnt thrilled with it.. well the combination of this Iron and The Argan Oil my my level 4 chocolate brown color brilliant and luminous.. Also the plates are of high quality.. very sturdy.. smooth.. i can tell they are very hard and also they FLOAT.. this is an IMPORTANT feature ladies and Gents who consider their hair their crowning glory. Since they \"float\" and move with your hair and rotate.. the iron is very easy to use and versatile depending on what you want to do with it. Don't get me wrong i have an ENTIRE line of CHI products and already own one of their flat irons. Im a die hard Chi fan... but you really oughta give this bargain of an item a try. I will always love CHI but i am VERY interested to see what HSI begins to do with its product line... though i only needed the iron and the Argan oil and i REALLY like that the Oil is Natural... penetrates my hair.. unlike my other products which are mostly silicone based and layer up and sometimes actually seem to dry my hair. I knew the argon oil was superior the second i flattend the first section of hair. I saw some steam but it made no sound.. and and pulled iron straight through and unlike with my other iron with no floating plates i flipped under at the end of section all in one motion... The section was flawless.. no second or third run through. and shiny.. very shiny. Also my style has lasted a few days ;-)", "id": 11058261}

I have had to fight it tooth and nail.. multiple salon hair cuts to tame it.. I use a LOT of straightening products and on occasion.. yuck.. strong chemical relaxers you need a gas mask and hazmat suit to use... switched to a chi smoothing relaxer.. smoothed but did NOT straighten hair.. Well i think i can TOSS a lot of that out now that i have my HSI. I put a lil of the Argan oil sample in my hair. Heated up the iron and gave it a go without overly high expectations. In 20 minutes i had my shiny, silky. and Pin straight!!! and no heat damage.. I was SHOCKED that this 40 dollar iron had all these options and worked so well I had to struggle so much with my hair before,but NO MORE!! The packaging is top notch as well.. and the storage bag is to die for. Also the Argan Oil is a MIRACLE serum... When i say miracle im not kidding.. God actually answered my years of praying for my hair to cooperate... its always been a love hate thing .. its SO much better than anything containing any type of silicone and i will be ordering a 4oz bottle of the HSI Argan Oil as a compliment for sure.. I currently use Chi Silk Serum.. while it is effective.. it does NOT come into the league of the HSI Argan Oil... it may be expensive for the oil but you get what you pay for... it doesn't take a lot.. I know my own hair texture and i can guarantee with the HSI iron it WILL close the cuticle.. make it soft.. shiny.. I haven't even used my Expensive Chi Hairspray.. dont seem to need it.. hair moves naturally and then back in place.. In the past i had to layer my hair in smoothing and holding products.. i've Never been happier with a hair tool and i've had MANY.. and i still just cant get over the price.... I'm a man but I've been in the company of a LOT of stylists and designers and h ave access to high end products.. but i hate always having to beg them to style my hair and then its gone once the nights over like Cinderella.. i pay much more for a cut and style at the salon than i paid for this Flat Iron. Also no more next day disappointment after the salon when i cant replicate what the stylist did ,, because with my HSI i CAN replicate it :) quite easily and quickly actually.. Also I color my hair EVERY 4-6 weeks... i colored my hair a week ago and i wasnt thrilled with it.. well the combination of this Iron and The Argan Oil my my level 4 chocolate brown color brilliant and luminous.. Also the plates are of high quality.. very sturdy.. smooth.. i can tell they are very hard and also they FLOAT.. this is an IMPORTANT feature ladies and Gents who consider their hair their crowning glory. Since they \"float\" and move with your hair and rotate.. the iron is very easy to use and versatile depending on what you want to do with it. Don't get me wrong i have an ENTIRE line of CHI products and already own one of their flat irons. Im a die hard Chi fan... but you really oughta give this bargain of an item a try. I will always love CHI but i am VERY interested to see what HSI begins to do with its product line... though i only needed the iron and the Argan oil and i REALLY like that the Oil is Natural... penetrates my hair.. unlike my other products which are mostly silicone based and layer up and sometimes actually seem to dry my hair. I knew the argon oil was superior the second i flattend the first section of hair. I saw some steam but it made no sound.. and and pulled iron straight through and unlike with my other iron with no floating plates i flipped under at the end of section all in one motion... The section was flawless.. no second or third run through. and shiny.. very shiny. Also my style has lasted a few days ;-)", "id": 7230260011}

{"review": "An excellent flat iron! On par with Chi or perhaps better. Besides the excellent price, this flat iron heats up quickly, slides easily through your hair, and its round body offers a comfortable grip. The same round body also makes it really easy to add a wave or tons of curls to your 'do. I watched a few customers reviews on this item before purchasing and one woman described how her hair remained straight even after having it up in a bun or pony tail all day. This is totally true! My hair reamins soft and silky while keeping its straight shape even if I push it behind my ears. The only downside to this item is that it doesn't have an automatic shut off switch. However, it has a convertable voltage (great for travelling overseas!), a reset button on the plug and comes in a nice case with a free bottle of Argan oil! The HSI is an amazing flat iron that I recommend to anyone, especially if you have hair like mine that is stubborn when it comes to straightening.", "id": 11058261}

{"review": "I am not one to leave many reviews unless I have a tidbit of hopefully useful information. I am a 40 something surgery nurse and gardener who has worn a ponytail for 20 some years.

What I got was razor cut layers that were supposed to shape my face and did not work on my hair. What I did know is that I didn't like what these people were doing to my hair. What I didn't know until the 4th girl, was that there have been alot of advancements in hair straighteners and dryers...hmmm. She showed me how to use a paddle brush and my hair was still frizzy after drying so she showed me frizz control solution and a newer straightening iron. Who woulda thunk it. I am not one to give up on an appliance of any kind until it dies on me and I have to replace it. Little did I know that my wet to style remington 1\" curved plates was extremely outdated and was causing the problem!!!I now love my hair and my stylist because she took the initiative and the time to explain the benefits of an upgrade!!! Hairstylists are like nurses in that all people need discharge instructions in order to have a successful recovery. So please hairstylists, if you are wondering why people don't come back after an initial visit...take the time to chat with your client while you are cutting to see what the expectations are AND what kind of antique appliances they are using at home! It may just get you more returns!!!", "id": 11058261}

So please hairstylists, if you are wondering why people don't come back after an initial visit...take the time to chat with your client while you are cutting to see what the expectations are AND what kind of antique appliances they are using at home! It may just get you more returns!!!", "id": 7230259011}
{"review": "I am not one to leave many reviews unless I have a tidbit of hopefully useful information. I am a 40 something surgery nurse and gardener who has worn a ponytail for 20 some years. Yes, my hair styling routine had gotten lazy and I had my hair all one length. I was ready to actually have a style and ended up going to 4 different stylists in a year. I wanted visible layers! What I got was razor cut layers that were supposed to shape my face and did not work on my hair. What I did know is that I didn't like what these people were doing to my hair. What I didn't know until the 4th girl, was that there have been alot of advancements in hair straighteners and dryers...hmmm. She showed me how to use a paddle brush and my hair was still frizzy after drying so she showed me frizz control solution and a newer straightening iron. Who woulda thunk it. I am not one to give up on an appliance of any kind until it dies on me and I have to replace it.

{"review": "I bought this based off the reviews, I never heard of this company but I took a chance. So glad I did! First, props to amazon for shipping this in under 3 days, I didn't expect this to arrive for another week and a half. I used it right away and I cut my straightening time down to 25 minutes! That's a pretty big deal for me considering it normally takes me over an hour and my hair can only be described as (Troy polamalu) Samoan hair. The price of this straightener caused me to be skeptical because I figured if it was cheap that it didn't work well. Wrong! This is the best straightener I've owned and far surpasses my chi models. Take a chance on this product, you won't regret it! UPDATE: so it has been about a year and 4 months and I'm happy to say that my straightener is still going strong! I use it about 3-4 times a week and am very impressed that it has held up considering it was such a cheap purchase. If you are still on the fence about this product based off the little known brand, make the purchase. It is well worth it and saves me about 30 minutes in the morning (my chi took just under an hour to straighten, the HSI takes me 15-20 minutes tops). I'm happy that a $40 straightener lasted over a year and if it eventually gives out on me I will be ordering the same one again!", "id": 11058261}

{"review": "After my straightener for the last five years finally gave its last croak a few weeks ago, I was in the market for a new straightener. Because of its reputation, I assumed I was going to get a CHI, but decided to look around a little first and came across this bad boy. After looking at all the positive reviews and awesome price I decided to give this baby a chance. I am so happy I did! The straightener works way better than my old one ever did, the black handles and black plates give it a very sleek and attractive appearance, and it even comes in its own red satin-y lined black box which makes it feel like pulling a sacred relic straight from Dracula's coffin. I would recommend getting some of the Argan oil too. I decided to try it out the sample first before I bought a bottle and I should have just bought it then. It makes my hair sleek and soft like a kitten. TLDR: Highly recommend this product, don't waste your money on a more expensive straightener because this one is awesome.", "id": 11058261}

{"review": "First of all, fulfillment by Amazon was flawless. They ship it very fast and sooner than expected. I have Prime so it got here in 2 days. A+ for Amazon! Now on to the product: Many say that this HSI is better than Chi or Paul Michell. I was very skeptical because I've never heard of it and would be happy even if its just ok because of its low price. After just using it once, I am convinced that it is indeed better and the best you can buy for under $60. I have wavy fizzy hair that is hard to contour and control. After using this and the sample argan oil included, my hair was transformed just like you would see on TV Extreme Make Over. No kidding! Pros: Makes thick and wavy hair straighten easily and fast Best bang for your buck Good ergonomics allows amateurs to handle it like a pro Makes hair silky soft with the include Argan Oil sample Cons: No auto shutoff timer Update: Mine stop working after about a year. I called them up and they sent me a new one no questions asked! They stand behind their products and customer service was excellent. I would give them an extra star making it 6 STARS but Amazon only allows for 5 max", "id": 11058261}

Now on to the product: Many say that this HSI is better than Chi or Paul Michell. I was very skeptical because I've never heard of it and would be happy even if its just ok because of its low price. After just using it once, I am convinced that it is indeed better and the best you can buy for under $60. I have wavy fizzy hair that is hard to contour and control. After using this and the sample argan oil included, my hair was transformed just like you would see on TV Extreme Make Over. No kidding! Pros: Makes thick and wavy hair straighten easily and fast Best bang for your buck Good ergonomics allows amateurs to handle it like a pro Makes hair silky soft with the include Argan Oil sample Cons: No auto shutoff timer Update: Mine stop working after about a year. I called them up and they sent me a new one no questions asked! They stand behind their products and customer service was excellent. I would give them an extra star making it 6 STARS but Amazon only allows for 5 max", "id": 1294321011}

{"review": "I am a female with very thin hair on the top of my head. I have had this issue for about 10 years. I would never try Rogaine, too proud. In a desperate moment, I ordered a can of men's Rogaine. After 3 months of once a day use, I have hair! My hairdresser cannot believe and accused me of dying my hair! It was not dyed but thicker! I am a believer and continue using men's Rogaine!", "id": 11057581}
{"review": "I started using this as an 18 year old who noticed thinning in the crown area. It wasn't to the point of being highly noticeable by anyone--just slightly thin if I ran my hand through it. Still, I thought Rogaine would be a good option to reverse my thinning and preempt further loss. So I applied it religiously for four months. What made me stop? After months 3 or 4 I practically had a reverse yamakah! I'd say the crown area had 30 to 40% of the hair a full, healthy head would have. Now, I know that supposedly there is an initial shedding phase with Rogaine and then hair grows back, but I had already reached the 4 month mark where regrowth should be apparent, yet it wasn't. How much longer was I going to apply this chemical concoction to my hair hoping its effects do a complete about-face and actually start regrowing my hair? So I stopped. Now a year later, my crown is still just as thin as when I threw out the Rogaine. Lesson learned: think before you gamble on things like this.", "id": 11057581}

{"review": "Do I like Rogaine.... I love it!!! Let me tell everyone a quick story. Im in my mid 40's. back when I was mid 20's Ihad a friend ( same age). He developed a large bald spot on his crown. - and that was 20 years ago Fast forward... 20 years I lost touch with him for about 15 years and eventually set up a dinner to meet. Since I havent seen him for so long, I figured he must be completely bald. That evening, I met up with him. To my amazement, he had a complete head of hair. I was shocked. Dont get me wrong. It wasnt the head of hair you see on the posters hung on a barber shop wall. But still, no bald spot, no receding hair line. I got up to go to the bathroom 3x so that I could come back and look at the crown of his head.to see if there was a weave or something unusual going on.. I looked very natural. So over the next 9 months, I would talk to hi on occasion.Finally I said to him, what s up with your hair? Did you get a weave or hair transplant. He then told me about Rogaine w Minoxidil and how good it worked for him. For the next few months I started thinking about it. I was never completely bald. I lost my hair on about a 4\" area on the crown, the hair line receded and the top was thinning a bit. All typical for a 40 something I would think. I started to think that my hair never really completely fell out. Maybe with Rogaine, I could have the same results that my friend did. I ordered my 1st 3 month supply. What I did from here was for the next 6 months, i buzzed my head ( military cut) never shaving it. I bought a hair clipper and every week buzzed it 2x down to nothing. I used the rogaine as prescribed.. Here is where is gets cool. I remember grabbing a mirror and looking at the back of my head. I definitely say new hair growth without a doubt. But i said to myself does it warrant the price of the Rogaine. Now , I stopped shaving my head and started to let my hair grow in around month 9. MY God....It worked..... The hair that was there was a new revived consistancy. Thicker and full. The entire top of my head was filling in. The bald spot in the back now has hair growing on it and filling in ( it really is filling in) Do I have the hair I did when I was 20 - absolutely not BUT I have a great head of hair. My hair follicles seem to somehow been revitalized with the foam and YES, it does grow new hair back. I read the packaging prior to starting and it states somewhere that you ay not get the same results as others or something to that extent. You may not grow hair at all.... For me... I enjoy it. When i was young, i used to use hair gels and sprays. The foam is nothing different. A small bit in the morning and at night as well. I actually have friends asking me whats up with my hair...lol Like I had a replacement ( very funny) ANyway... I hope this review finds its way to other s with interest Good Luck", "id": 11057581}
{"review": "I'm not sure if this product was previously used, \"since it comes un-packaged\". The first 14 days it worked fine, then it turned into liquid and emptied up 4 days later. I used the exact dosage recommended, I opened the official website and followed the instructions as precise as possible.", "id": 11057581}
{"review": "Frankly this review is slightly embarrassing to write, nobody wants to admit that they're going bald, especially to everyone on the internet. But I really think it's important to share my finding about Rogaine because there seems to be a lot of negativity directed towards this product. First and foremost, Rogaine works for only a very small percentage of people, but it does work. Secondly, it's not the end-all, be-all product for hair-loss. Hair loss is caused by a number of factors, including the loss of testosterone and the increase in DHT. Rogaine does not go after these factors as a cause of hair loss, which is why it is only effective less than 50% of the time. What Rogaine does is focus on opening channels in your cell membrane to promote hair regrowth. While the mechanism isn't 100% understood it basically is trying to increase oxygen and blood flow to the part of your scalp that needs it to produce more hair. I've actually had very little success with Rogaine, until I started using this product AS WELL as Rogaine. Both products alone simply did not work for me. I'm still unsure as to why each product wouldn't simply add the other's ingredients, but perhaps it's an efficacy problem and combining both would water-down the other. What I usually end up doing sounds more like a ritual than anything because it takes over 30 minutes to apply both products to my scalp, but I have to say it's well worth it after (finally) seeing some significant hair regrowth. Rogaine itself is a foam, you must apply this FIRST before applying the NuNutrients hair serum. You must apply this to a 100% clean head, no hair products are anything on it. You don't want to block the transmission of any of the chemicals in the products that are helping you regrow your hair! That said, I also must tell you NOT to blow dry you hair. This is going to demolish your existing healthy hair and burn your cells around the follicles. Just gently towel dry your hair, and then apply the rogaine foam. Let the foam go deep into your pores, and let it air dry. Make sure to wash your fingers after you do it, you don't need hair there! (jk) After you let the foam completely absorb, within 15 min you MUST apply the NuNutrients. This product is a spray, and I recommended that you actually spraying it on your hands if you only have a small section of hair that needs to be regrown. After it's on your hands, then massage it onto the problem areas of your scalp. However, if your whole head is missing hair, then the spray is actually easier than trying to apply it to your fingers then your hair. After you let this product dry on your scalp, do NOT by any means wear a hat!!! I was doing this for over a month because I was ashamed of my balding head, and it really does counter the affects of using these products. Lastly, I can say that after 4 months of using this technique, I'm actually now starting to see results. I've used Rogaine by itself for over a year, but that alone wasn't doing the trick. I hope this review helps.", "id": 11057581}
{"review": "I started experiencing hair loss when I was 20. I noticed copious amounts of hair on my bathroom counter and saw my forehead was getting larger. Shortly after I started using the classic Rogaine 5 percent solution. It was difficult to apply to the scalp and made my morning and evening routines longer than usual. After a year I stopped using it. Why? I don't know, I just kind of stopped. Now I'm 26, my hair loss has gotten dramatically worse so I finally said \"Why not?\" and decided to give Rogaine another shot. I bought a one month supply of the foam and was so very happy on how easy it is to apply. It's a creamy mousse that takes less than 30 seconds to apply to the scalp. I simply spray 3-4 small mounds of the foam on different areas of my hair/scalp and rub it in. Because it is a mousse style product, it will stiffen your hair a little bit, but If used and styled properly I find it actually thickens my hair. I let it dry for 5 minutes and then I'll run a comb through, which breaks up the stiff hair and leaves me with a thicker looking hair. It's so noticeably thicker that people have said \"Your hair looks thicker.\" Since I have been using it for only a month, I can't tell if it's actually regrowing hair. I will report later after a few more months. Pros: -EASY TO APPLY (FINALLY!) -Thickens hair, if styled properly -Doesn't drip like old Rogaine -No irritated scalp Cons: -A little expensive Yes I included expense as a con. But in a way, Rogaine has great quality control. I've used generic minoxidil and it irritated my scalp badly. I know that generic minoxidil foam does exist, but you really don't save that much money buying the stuff. This Rogaine foam was excellent and I think it's worth the extra money.", "id": 11057581}
{"review": "I have been using for quite some time. I am ok on my crown, but I was losing hair on my right temple. It got so bad that if I pulled my hair back with my hand I could clearly see my scalp on the side in the mirror even after 6 weeks of my visit to the barber shop. Some say its not made for growing hair on the sides or temple, but I see good results and I see more little hairs growing on my front hairline. I used the liquid version, but it showed little or no results and i could only use it during the day since I would get itchiness on my scalp. I was worried and disappointed until I read that some people mentioned that they got better results with the foam. I tried it and bingo! And the foam I use it twice a day as directed and no problem. Maybe its the direct rubbing on your scalp that makes this product work. I dont know, but I am sure that I got great results and my recommendation is that keep trying until you find what works best for you.", "id": 11057581}
{"review": "Annoying to apply simply because all the adds show the guy having fresh \"no product\" hair. That is not the case. If its too warm its really just like putting gel in your hair. Even if its not too warm still has a gel-ish type effect on your hair. Long run short, it works but when youre trying to look like you have more hair and this matts it down... kinda defeats the purpose.", "id": 11057581}

Oil pulling is something you do in the morning before you brush your teeth. It's suppose to remove all the toxic from your body. I was a little skeptical at first, but I've been doing this faithfully for a year now , it's gives me lots of energy & it also help whiten my teeth too.

Don't swish like how you would with mouth wash . 2: I use it on my skin as a moisturizer . I know it sounds crazy, but hey it made my skin super soft.

{"review": "I'm very strict with my diet. I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 7 brands of organic coconut oil -- Nature's Way, Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, Bronner's, Ziggy Marley Organics, VivaLabs, and 2 small scale raw food companies. Nature's Way and VivaLabs are the best so far. The aroma of Nature's Way and VivaLabs both are wonderful. The texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has bolder taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. I know that the way coconut oil (and all oils for that matter) is processed is very important. Better processing methods preserve more nutrients, increase the natural flavor and aroma, and improved digestibility. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is one by Nature's Way is excellent, as is VivaLabs brand too. Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is: 1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much work. Most fats require the body to work harder for digestion. Medium chain fatty acids energy the blood stream very quickly, with less digestion time than slow or long chain fatty acids, found in other oils. This makes coconut oil excellent for people missing gallbladders, having digestive problems or suffering from chronic fatigue. 2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. Coconut oil is a much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc). Carbohydrate break down quickly and elevate blood sugar and insulin levels rapidly. This creates the surge and crash. With coconut oil, the energy is delivered more slowly and evenly than carbs. Many people feel deeply nourished by coconut oil, like the food energy goes deeper within the body. 3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Coconut oil keeps your digestive system very clean inside. It will destroy candida, and common cold bacteria and flu viruses. This helps to balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria and gives the immune system support. Less sickness and more energy! 4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the \"eat every 3 hours\" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body. 5) Tastes great. Smells great. 6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft. Coconut oil is absorbed directly into the skin to nourish it (like a food for the skin), unlike most cosmetic moisturizers create a coating on top the skin. These often leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance. Coconut supports the skin's natural oil balance. This also helps to reduce wrinkles! 7) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner. Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the hair's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners. Plus, because coconut is anti-\"everything bad\" it will keep the hair clean too. Because there are so many different types of hair (dry, cracking, split ends, oily, curly, straight, etc) experiment with what works best. Try applying the oil only the the ends for extra protection from split ends. Or only to the scalp to stop dandruff (caused by scalp bacteria, often candida) or prevent hair loss. 8)Natural soap for the body. Myself, some of my friends and others use coconut oil as a soap for the body. Most bar soaps and liquid bath soaps remove the skin's natural oils and create dry skin. In fact, most people have dry skin and fail to see that the bath soap is causing it! We still need to clean our skin, but using coconut oil is better than soap in many cases. You may want to soap under the armpits, between the legs, on the hands and feet. But for the arms, legs, and torso (areas prone to dryness) try using only coconut oil. Here's the protocol that I use. 1) Dry skin brush my entire body before stepping in the shower, to remove dead skin cells and increase blood flow to the skin (redness is good). 2) Rise the body with hot water to open the pores and increase blood flow to the skin. 3) Use a wet cloth or your hand to rub the skin rinse clean any loose skin cells. 4) Turn off the water and use your fingers/hands to rub a light layer of coconut oil everywhere (minus your head hair). A light layer is all that is needed. Apply with your skin still wet and you'll see the water bead up. 5) Turn back on the water, this time to warm/cool, and rise off the excess coconut oil. Run your hand lightly over your skin to spread the excess coconut oil into places that may have less, and to help remove the excess altogether. Lightly is the key - you don't want to remove the oil completely. 6) Exit the shower and lightly tap dry your skin with a towel (do not rub your take off the oil) or air dry. The skin will absorb the coconut oil in a few minutes. Your skin will be soft to the touch and not oily. Don't worry, coconut is not like other oils - it won't stain your clothes or make them smell rancid. 9) Sunscreen and suntan lotion. Coconut oil protects the skin from the effects too much sunlight. Technically, coconut oil does not block the sunlight, like a UV sunblock would. Instead it prevents the harmful chemical reaction skin bacteria and skin fungus can have when exposed to the suns UV rays. It also moisturizes the skin, reflects back some light (the shine), and prevents sunburn. Personally, I lay out in the summertime sun in Arizona, Florida and Hawaii and when wearing coconut oil I can be out for 4-6 hours and not burn. In these powerful suns, 30 minutes to 1 hour of exposure without coconut oil and my skin is red and will peel days later. Although coconut oil does not block UV, it does wonders to protect the skin and create a great tan. 10) Can be used as a sexual lubricant. Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem. 11) Coconut oil detox cleanse. The medium chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-\"everything bad\" properties. The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day). The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well. You can find the instructions by Googling \"Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse\". This is a very powerful detoxification because the bad guys are being killed by the oil. So be mindful. That's it! I hope you enjoyed this review. The bottom line is that coconut oil is simply amazing! Nature's Way and VivaLabs brands are the best I've found so far. Enjoy! *** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil. Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)", "id": 11060691}

Enjoy! *** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil. Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)", "id": 16320351}
{"review": "I always buy the 16 oz. size here on Amazon. I always wish that I ordered a larger size so I finally did- this one. I divided this 32 oz. size into 3 separate containers: 1 jar for food purposes; 1 bottle with a \"squirt top\" (you know, like that spout looking top that is on a hotdog stand ketchup/mustard bottle? Ok- THAT. That's what I'm talking about) for hair and a jar for body moisturizing. This is a wonderful skin & hair moisturizer but I want to use this post to bring out something very important. COCONUT OIL IS COMEDOGENIC. What does that mean? It means that IT WILL CLOG YOUR FACIAL PORES AND CAUSE BLACKHEADS. It might not at first but eventually it will. The remedy for that could be to use it sparingly on your face or to not use it on your face at all. Pay attention to your face and make the best decision for your facial situation. I still use it as a body moisturizer- from the neck down- and I love it. Be careful when you put it on your scalp because the oil will/can drip down the side of your head near your temples and cause break outs there, too. Nature's Way Coconut Oil is a 5 star product with too many benefits to list. Just know that coconut oil can clog your pores and there are natural oils that do not clog pores. *I am LC from NC*", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "FYI for those who looks for cold-pressed coconut oil, this is not the one!! I was looking for a cold-pressed coconut oil, and the online description says so, so i decided to go with this one. Once I received the product, the description on the container said it is expeller pressed, which is different from the description that I found from the buyer here. Otherwise, Smell good, taste good, and feel good after applying to my skin after shower. (but i would prefer to get the cold pressed one.)", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "Wow! I love this coconut oil! I have read about the wonders of coconut oil (increases metabolism, antiviral/antifungal/antibacterial properties, etc) and decided to start adding it to my daily diet. This brand is superb -- taste soooooo good and smells divine. I have used it on my toast and it could easily replace butter because the taste is buttery smooth and with very slight sweetness. The smell is not overwhelming and it's just very mild. Another plus is the price -- such a great deal for 32 ounces! I have looked around at different online and local stores for high quality coconut oil and the price cannot touch this, the only thing cheaper would be the low quality, rancid-smelling coconut oil being sold at local stores. Coconut oil will melt at 76 degrees, so I kept mine in the refrigerator to keep it solid. I've also used this as a moisturizer for my itchy and dry spots and works like a charm, easily melts when applied. I've divided mine for kitchen and body use -- simply wonderful! Highly recommended!", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "I got this to experiment with the antifungual and health boosting properties, and I have to say I really like it. The plastic jar arrived full of very warm, fully melted coconut oil, thankfully well sealed or it would have been everywhere. The oil itself is really good stuff, has a lovely coconut smell to it. A little while in the fridge and it's solid as a candle for long term storage, and to melt some off I just fill a tub with hot water from the tap and let the whole jar float around in it for a while. I pour off what I need, and back in the fridge it goes. Mostly I'm using this as a topical or as a food additive, but one thing I did was to pour some out in a disposable aluminum mini-cake pan and add powdered sugar and cocoa powder (Frontier Fair Trade Cocoa Powder Processed with Alkali), mixed it really well, and let it solidify in the freezer for a bit. Amazing, delicious freezer coconut oil chocolate bar, I was really impressed with the quality even if it's a little oily and fast to melt. Anyway, I like this and I will get it again when I run through this jar. Nice! NR417", "id": 11060691}

{"review": "Well needless to say, this is my second review on this product (I think). I absolutely love this stuff. I've decided to go with the bigger jar (since mine doesn't last a month) on the subscribe and save. I mix this with my shea butter. Since I'm a bit of a chemist in my family I decided to mix a concoction for us. This changes the scent of the shea butter a bit since I'm not really into the scent, even though I have gotten used to the scent from the first seller I purchased the shea butter from. I've also noticed my eczema has vanished since I've been using the pure coconut oil on my skin. My skin looks over all wonderful with more of a glow, I even noticed when I stopped putting this on my skin after the shower (ran out of coconut oil) that my skin problem tried to come back, so I'll have to start up again. Whoever buys this is going to love it, I just suggested that you buy the 32 oz. since you'll probably be using it for everything from kitchen to bathroom.", "id": 11060691}

They responded one time with a \"we resend it, if you not get it in one week ill refund you\" 2 months ago. Now they wont respond. STILL NOTHING. I have, and I will be writing them every day... and letting everyone know how they ripped me off until they refund me. Just $5???!?!? I don't have much money.... and to me it's not just $5.... I've wasted months waiting on this item, I really wanted to try it out. And I am beyond disappointed. So much time wasted. I always read the reviews and sometimes they are all so diff, I think how can 10 people rate them a 5 stars and then others a 1?

{"review": "As a nurse I wash my hands several hundred times a day it seems. Even with the hospitals using moisturizing soaps my skin gets very dry.

I take this cream and let it sit on the crack for as long as I can. By the next day or so the crack has healed enough to be more manageable.

{"review": "I purchased this ointment based on a recommendation by my son's pediatrician. My son suffers from severe eczema and nothing we were using on him was helping. We have to be very careful with what we use on his skin because anything can make his condition flare up. The pediatrician recommended we use the Aquaphor ointment on him at least two times a day, and especially after his bath. She also said it is important to apply it within minutes after patting him dry from his bath before the skin has a chance to 'dry out'. This is the only product that has helped his skin condition. If we use it on him twice a day his eczema is nearly non-existent. It has worked so well on him that I started using it after I shower and it has made a tremendous difference in my skin. I don't have eczema but in the winter I end up with severe dry skin and this is the only moisturizer that made a difference. The only downside to this ointment is that it goes on greasy and can take a few minutes for the greasiness to soak in. I prefer not to put on any good clothes right away in case some of the grease transfers to my clothes before it soaks into my skin. If there is a greasy spot or two on the clothing then using powder on the spots helps to get it out (let the powder sit on the greasy spot for a few minutes or more so it soaks up the oils, then brush the powder away). Even though it goes on greasy I decided to give it 5 stars because it is an 'ointment' rather than a 'moisturizer,' and it does what it is supposed to better than any other product we have tried.", "id": 322263011}

{"review": "I have been using and carrying around this product with me for years. It's safe, gentle, and dermatologist recommended. I've used it on my infant daughter's diaper rash when anything containing Zinc Oxide made her bottom bleed (she's allergic to that), and it cleared up overnight. She's 2 now, and we both still use it. I apply a small amount to my dry, bleeding and cracked cuticles at night, and they're smooth in the morning. It's also a great remedy for dry, cracked lips. I always keep a tube on me. It's expensive, but the 1.75 ounce tube lasts a very long time, and goes a really long way. I stick to what I like, and this product absolutely never disappoints! There is one mistake I made recently I thought I'd share. I was at a Walgreens looking to purchase more, and chose the store brand over the Eucerin Brand. Big mistake!! The store brand product immediately liquefied in a sort of filmy, slimy liquified version of something that's meant to soothe and coat your lips with moisture. Upon further research I found a few interesting facts... First, both products do contain the key ingredient of Petroleum (41%). However, the Aquaphor brand contains other Inactive Ingredients listed as: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin and Bisabolol. The \"Store Brand\" lacks the last three I've listed in the Aquaphor Brand. The difference is quite shocking. Could this be why the store brand is such poor quality as compared to the Eucerin brand? I don't know, but I'll never buy store brand for this product again. Be sure to check labels before you buy store brand to make sure it really is similar to the name brand, otherwise you might find that you've saved a $1 on something that turns out to be a waste of money.", "id": 322263011}

{"review": "All you need is a sandwich bag. 1. Tie and pin back any hair. This stuff gets everywhere. 2. Put a scoop of clay into the sandwich bag. Add water or vinegar. Seal out all the air inside the bag and knead it into a smooth paste. Adjust with more clay or water as needed until you get your desired consistency. 3. Partially flip the sandwich bag inside out on your hand, like a glove. Apply the clay to your face with your bag-glove. Your hands don't get dirty and you won't need any additional utensils. 3. Let dry 10-15 min and remove with facial wipes (the pre-moistened kind). Alternatively, you can rinse it out into a basin or bowl, but don't do it into the sink or shower because it'll eventually clog your drains. It's mud. 4. Moisturize. The good thing about this sandwich bag method is that if you have any extra (and I always make too much), you can just keep it in the bag for the next use. You literally bought a jar of dirt off Amazon; don't waste it. Seal out all the air to keep it from drying. [Protip #1: If you don't wash your hair every day, apply this stuff before you shower on a non-wash day. When you finish, just rinse it off. Time saver!] [Protip #2: Dried, this stuff looks like boogers. So clean it out extra carefully around your nose to avoid awkward public situations.] HOORAH. It's clean, it's cheap, and it's easy. And you won't have to throw out a single bit. As for the review of the product itself, I can't attest to that as well as the other reviewers. I'm several years past my teenage bad-skin era. I use this mask to deep clean my pores around once a week, which it definitely does. This is in additional to cleanser/moisturizer 2x daily + exfoliating every few days so I have consistently good skin. However, the other reviews of this product's effectiveness are stellar, and that's what convinced me to buy. :)", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG REVIEW BUT PLEASE, PLEASE TAKE JUST 5 MINUTES OUT OF YOUR LIFE TO READ THIS IF YOU SUFFER FROM ACNE. Wow. Where do I begin. Really, where do I begin. First, let me just say I have dreamed and prayed, literally dreamed of the day I can write a success story of my own in regards to acne. Any acne sufferer has tried hundreds of different products, read thousands of Google searches/reviews/blogs, and experienced an endless amount of frustration, pain, and confusion. I don't use the word embarrassment or humiliation, because you shouldn't be embarrassed nor should you be humiliated if you have acne. I have read thousands of reviews with writers saying they don't want to walk out the door or that they're embarrassed to face the world. You are who you are. These things happen. Acne is normal, it's everywhere. That shouldn't affect who you are as a person. Yes, it can be difficult to face the world. I can relate. But frustration and confusion are the best terms. Frustration because we don't know how to cure it. After trying every given product or method, it just doesn't go away. And confusion because sometimes we have no clue what is going on that causes all that acne. Now, let me get some facts out of the way. I'm a 21 year old male, college student. I've been suffering from acne for well over 8 years now. About the time I reached 13, obviously because of puberty and the typical growing phases, I was one of the unlucky ones plagued with pretty bad acne. It didn't get worse till about high school, but again high school is a time when we all go through improvements so having acne is not as bad. People get braces and go through other various stages during this time so it's no biggie. But in college, you really expect by about the time you're 18, your acne should be dissipating. And for most it does. But let's face it there will be and always will be a select bunch that still walk around with red spots all over their faces. Don't let that put you down. There are people out there who don't have proper vision, hearing, or worse disabilities. Now, I don't want to go into a pep talk lecture here, so let me get right to it, but I just want you all to know that 1) don't let this acne put you down.. and 2) THIS product will change your life. Here's the thing, I always read those reviews that say \"this product may not work for you as everyone is different\". I hate those reviews. That's rubbish. It's crap. It's true but that's the reason I hate it, because it's true. Every product may not work for you. BUT.. THIS product in particular is for everyone and doesn't present different, adverse effects on different skin types. Why might you ask? Well, it's simple. It's 100% pure dirt. Good ol' natural dirt. Literally that's what it is. The reason those OTHER products react differently on different skin types is because those are all products that contain chemicals, and different ones at that. So you can imagine. Obviously everyone's skin will react differently to various chemicals. Some good, some bad. This, however, is pure clay/dirt that will literally dig into the pores and flush out whatever gunk you may have. Now, I view acne at 3 different levels. Minor, Moderate, Severe. But on each stage there are another 3 levels. In other words, you may have Minor acne but may be on level 1, 2, or 3. A Minor acne sufferer with a level 3 may have worse acne than a minor level 1 and 2, but not as bad as one who would be listed in the Moderate acne stage. Same goes for if you are for example a Moderate acne sufferer but a level 3, you may not be so bad to the point of being a Severe acne sufferer, but in the Moderate stage you are still worse than others. If this makes any sense, I put myself at Moderate acne Level 2 and 3. On rare occasions, I hit Severe level 1 with a deep cyst or two, but haven't experienced that recently. Right now, my face is continuously at a Moderate level 2. Severe acne sufferers are those whose faces are literally clustered with severe red acne on every area of the face. Moderate would be one or two major sections (my two cheeks). Minor acne would be a small area like chin or just nose, or no major breakouts but a few pimples here and there. So all my life, like every other acne sufferer I have tried any and every acne remedy known to man. I kid you not. In the beginning (in my early teens) stages I tried the basic Neutrogena, Clean&Clear, basic drugstore crap. No effect there. As high school came around, I tried Cetaphil which proved a bit of an improvement, but again no cigar. I tried St.Ives peach apricot scrub for a while and that did some good stuff, but again nothing that could really vastly make an improvement. I tried masks, lemons, honey, yogurt, I mean you name it I tried it all. Don't even mention Benzoyl Peroxide. I tried a 3 step system and it screwed up my face. Anyways as I got to college, I came to face with the fact that I'm just going to have to \"let nature run its course'. But still, I couldn't just let my face sit there and use lame cleansers. I can't begin to tell you how many hours I've spent doing acne research. My freshman year in college, I gave a shot at the AcneFree system and used Benzoyl P. again which again burned my face so I realized I'm allergic to it. For some, it may be useful. Not for a soft sensitive skinned fellow like me. So then I realized I may need to spend some money on high end products. Keep in mind I'm a college guy... I started getting on Sephora and looking at the hundreds of different products they offer. Oh and let me just add that my acne in college was the worst it ever got unfortunately. It seemed like every year from the day I crossed paths with acne, it just got worse and worse. Ok, so back to sephora. Over the span of a year or 2, I spent hundreds of dollars on different products (and I tried each for a few months to give it a true trial)... some worked, some didn't. But I can never tell what products truly \"work\" because it seemed like every week I would get a few whiteheads and ugly red, swollen pimples. The worst issue about my acne is that I also have serious hyperpigmentation from all the years prior. So I tried things like Bio-oil, hydroquinone, etc. I tried even more extreme methods like chemical peels, and even spent $750 on a 6 week session of microdermabrasion. The microdermabrasion REALLY improved my right cheek and forehead, and today it's quite clear because of it. But for some reason I still would get major breakouts on my left cheek. After I stopped the microdermabrasion sessions, again my breakouts started coming back (even on the right side and forehead). I tried more stuff like Dennis Gross peel pads and Peter Thomas Roth pads. I can go on and on about the products I tried, but the point is.. none of them made the difference I wanted to see, or prevented breakouts. Best put, preventing breakouts is the ultimate goal. That wasn't happening. Now to this product. I decided to give this a shot about 3 weeks ago, just because once again desperation led me to another product. Because of the really high reviews and people writing success stories, I was filled with hope. I read one guy's review who mentioned that he's a college student male and puts it on his face every night and isn't even embarrassed because it prevents his acne. I am in the same boat as him. I put this on every night. Sometimes I skip a night, but regardless I get this stuff on my face 5 out of 7 days. Do it at night so that your sleep can recover the skin and in the morning you'll look like a million bucks. I never thought there would be a miracle product, because we've always been led to believe there really isn't a miracle product. But let me just tell you, THIS IS IT. I kid you not. Like I said, it's not a chemical. Of course no artificial/machine made product is a miracle product, but this fine clay dirt that's been around for centuries is... Oh let me just add I came across a prescribed professional line called M.D. Forte. It's quite pricey. I started using the M.D. Forte III 30% Glycolic Cleanser last December, and it has done wonders for my skin. It's oil free, soap free, and very gentle. Now, every night I cleanse my face with the cleanser and use the mask (I leave it on for about 30 minutes). My skin after feels like a baby's butt. No kidding. Then after the mask, I cool my skin with 100% witch hazel (no alcohol). and moisturize. and Voila. That's it. Bottom line: My acne is not 100% diminished, because like I said my skin has taken toll after years and years of acne. It will take time, but I KNOW I KNOW that this is the product that WILL and IS doing that. It is almost May. I will update this review in July and post some before/after pics. My before pics are ridiculous- it really shows how bad my acne has been. I can already tell this product is paving the way for success after 8 years, and hopefully with use of this I will be at ease. I will use this for the rest of my life. No joke. I'm going to really stock up on this stuff. I hope they never stop providing it for us. Right now, any pimple I get is completely halted after a night of this stuff.. even the deep cysts. Let me just warn you, the first week you will breakout. I broke out pretty badly (shows how all the other products never got the gunk out of my skin).. but I kept going because I read on it that it will happen and you should keep going. Week 2 came around and seriously my skin recovered and took the quickest 180 turn, even from how severe week 1 was. Now I'm in week 3, heading into week 4 and I don't get any major breakouts but any small (or large) pimple is completely healed by the next day. This literally flushes ALL of my pores. In the end, I'd just say use whatever cleanser (GENTLE cleanser) works for you. (oil free and soap free) Make this mask (with Apple Cider Vinegar-- i forgot to mention.. very important. use apple cider vinegar) Leave it on for 15-20 mins or 30.. depending on your skin. Use witch hazel with cotton pads (trust me on this) gently wipe skin with it Moisturize with whatever moisturizer works for you (oil-free) Try this regimen for a month and if you don't see major improvements, email me or contact me somehow and you can vent to me about your situation, but I promise this will work for ANY skin type because again it's completely natural there are no chemicals.. besides your cleanser and moisturizer, but that's why I advise using a quality, gentle cleanser. no drugstore brands please. they ruin your skin. go to Skinstore.com or dermstore.com and do some research on a gentle cleanser. On a final note, for some of you applying the mask every night may be too harsh. I'd say aim for 3 times every 7 days. I don't know how to end this.. I've been ranting for well over 10 minutes now, but clearly the reader can tell that I'm venting about this success story. I want to share it with the world. If you find this useful, please like the button that says you found it useful. Whether you have sever acne, moderate acne, or you're a well skinned jessica alba-type person, you can and will benefit from this. You are all beautiful .. EVERYONE is. but sometimes this crappy acne hides that true beauty. Again, don't be ashamed or embarrassed. It's something we can't control. Until now. With this mask, you can control it. PLEASE TRY THIS AND LET ME KNOW. I AM SO CURIOUS ABOUT OTHERS' success stories from this product! If you have any questions or comments just reply a comment to this review, I will check periodically. Like I said, my face is not clear JUST yet. My face still shows signs of moderate acne. That won't go in a few weeks. That's physically impossible. But I will keep you all posted and touch base in a few months! Good luck to you all and God bless! Try my regimen and see for yourself! Excuse me while I go out and enjoy this beautiful day and not let acne ruin my life :) ****UPDATE May 29, 2014**** Hello again peeps. I'm excited to say this is a GREAT positive update. I'll keep it short and sweet since my review itself is a novel... I wrote the review a little over a month ago, and if you read my entire review and understood the whole acne minor/moderate/sever stage level thing, let me just proudly say that I am now a Moderate Level 1 and haven't had any severe or crazy breakouts at all! I used to be Moderate Level 3/Severe 1 as I mentioned. My forehead is completely spotless, my nose is spotless, my chin is spotless. The only two areas are my cheeks which as I mentioned were pretty bad from all the years of acne prior. I deal with hyperpigmentation (not scarring, but post red acne marks that linger for months), and this mask is seriously seriously even healing and brightening/lightening my hyperpigementation. All my red marks have reduced by shades of about 15 to 20% I'd say. This is such an exciting product. I also want to add that because I'm a DJ, I travel quite a bit and recently I was in New York for about a week and didn't get to use the mask at all. The entire week in new york I didn't use this mask and I didn't break out ONCE! This product clearly keeps acne/pimples at bay. I think by July as I mentioned, I should be significantly clearer.. which I cannot wait to see! Also, I should add that I just purchased a 20% Vitamin C Serum that I came across on Amazon (link below) and it has seriously great reviews and helps with brightening and moisturizing etc. I will be applying it every night as well pre-moisturizer. Good luck and I hope you all are seeing great results! Vitamin C Serum - Antioxidant Treatment - Natural & Organic - Incl.

{"review": "If you want to clear everything out of your skin, this will do it. I have dry skin so I don't use vinegar, I use water. A friend of mine, who suggested this to me, has oily skin, large pores and breaks out a lot, so she uses the vinegar, and it works really well for her. You do NOT have to use a lot. I put a very thin layer on my skin and it works just as well. Actually, better, because when I put it on thick, pieces of it would fall off my face. A thin layer does the trick, and it stays on your face even after it dries. Also, the less you use, the less it will clog your drains. It super tightens your skin, and my pores are noticeably smaller (and I never had large pores, but after using this and noticing the difference it makes, I guess my pores were getting bigger). Your skin will be dry when you are done whether or not you have dry or oily skin, so moisturize after. Your skin will absorb anything you use very quickly, so I recommend a great moisturizer. I use Bel Essence Anti Aging Treatment - Intensive All Natural Anti-Wrinkle, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz because it is the best all natural moisturizer I have found, and it replenishes your skin with vitamins, fatty acids, and omega 3s that your skin needs to be healthy. I tried other drugstore brand moisturizers, and the Bel Essence gives me the best results that last. It is the best all natural skin cream I have tried. The combination of completely cleaning your skin with this clay and then a great moisturizer is amazing. You will not believe how soft and smooth your skin is after this facial/moisturizer, and your pores are immediately smaller. I did this every couple of days to start, to really clean my skin, then 1x or 2x a month. More is not necessarily better, remember, the clay removes EVERYTHING from your skin - the good and the bad. So make sure every time you use it, you replace the good to build your skin up. I found that the absolute best results were to use the clay before you shower at night, then after you get out of the shower, when your skin is warm, use the cream. It gets absorbed so much better and the results are the best. I LOVE this clay and the combination of the products has made a huge difference in my skin. The bonus is that after a couple of months, the fine lines on my face - eyes, forehead, lips are GONE. Love it. Update - the weather is getting a little cooler and drier now, so I don't do the mask as often, maybe once a week max, but the moisturizer I recommended, Bel Essence is amazing in the cooler and drier weather. My skin is still moisturized the whole day. Between the mask and the Bel Essence, all those fine lines on my face - GONE. My skin is tighter, firmer, better hydrated, and smoother. The mask gets rid of the old skin beautifully, and the Bel Essence builds up the new. I've lost 5 years at least on my face. UPDATE - I've been using this awhile and I have some more tips. First, I use water, not vinegar. I do have some acne (my skin breaks out more in the summer), but it's not a bad condition and the vinegar irritates my skin. So if you have normal, dry or just slightly oily skin, I would start out with just water for the mix, and maybe try the vinegar. Vinegar will dry your skin! Second. I recommend using this once a week, twice a week at most. If you have oily skin, it can cause your skin to produce more oil (because you are drying out your skin when you use it). So be careful and judge how frequent use affects your skin. One of the big reasons I use the Bel Essence cream is because after using the clay, I put oil back into my skin, so I don't end up with super dry skin, and also, I don't end up with super oily skin. Highly recommend the product for use with the clay - and the cream doesn't cause breakouts. I was a little hesitant to put oil on my skin, but it has only made my skin better. Third, even though I use a small amount, I sometimes end up with a little left over. I mix the clay in a container that I can store in the fridge so I can use it on my next treatment. I've been using both products for quite some time now, and my skin glows, is soft, always hydrated (thank you Bel Essence), and the clay also helps to minimize pores so my skin is smoother looking. Since I break out in the summer a bit, I use it twice a week, and it has helped more than anything else to keep my breakouts to a minimum. This is a routine I will be keeping forever and ever. (Don't discontinue your products Indian Clay and Bel Essence!) I get a lot of compliments of how good I look, people I run into always comment on my great skin. For someone who has up and down skin conditions, it is heaven to hear this!", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "I'm sure my review will be buried under the masses of rave reviews, but I do have some helpful tips if any of you get a chance to see this! First, this stuff is pretty sweet. After quite a few trial and error, I've found a few things: 1. BEST TIP - if you have any left over protein powder plastic scoops (c'mon I know you have a stash hidden somewhere that you swear you'll find a use for someday), you can just use one of those suckers to mix this mask in. Granted, you cant use a thimble sized scoop. Just use a regular one if you have it. 2. Next, just take your scoop and gather a small amount from the clay jar. Then you can just pour in the Apple Cider vinegar in a 1:2 ratio (1 part ACV to 2 parts clay). It takes a while to find the right amt to get the desired consistency, but it's not too hard. NEXT just take a wooden chopstick and stir. Stir a lot . It's pretty neat cos once you pour in the ACV it all starts bubbling and snapping at you. When mixed thoroughly it has a kind of \"whipped\" consistency. Then you just smear all over your face/ back/ arms/whatever. Then you wait until it starts pulling and burning yo skin! This stuff burns my face as it tightens, then itches like crazy, then feels like someones throwing ice cold water at my face. I dont normally get a pulsing sensation, and maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I enjoy it so leave me alone! Anyhoo, I find the plastic scoop method works the best, and leaves minimal clean up, as opposed to using a kitchen bowl and spoon which tend to leave quite a bit more mess. Usually I can just get all the last bits of the mask out of the scoop with my finger, leaving the scoop almost totally clean, then just wipe the chopstick off on a body part to get all the excess off. Real classy like. I always see how long I can keep this stuff on; usually 20-40 min. It tightens your face to the point where you cant even open your mouth, so it's kind of a hassle if your significant other is home, and you can't do anything but whimper at them like you're a pre-oiled Tin Man. I highly recommend doing this when you are home alone. The clean up is the only crappy part of all this and I have yet to find a good (and easy) solution, save from hosing myself off in the back yard :/ I really hate the idea of using all the paper towels we own just to wipe it off, and I don't like the idea of using a bath towel (since that goes in the washing machine, and who knows how much that'll clog up the machine). As of today my solution to this issue is getting half off with paper towels then jumping into the shower and pretending like nothing will harm the plumbing. Sometimes I try to rinse off equal parts in all 4 of our sinks, just to distribute the mess evenly. Once again also pretending like that will not clog up our plumbing... I think the pretending is working! 3. pro tip with the paper towel clean up - soak the towels in hot water, then lay it over your face for 10 seconds, then slowly drag the cloth down your face. If you just jump right in and smear the cloth over your face you're going to scream like Macaulay in Home Alone. 4. When I first received this product, I used it 4 days in a row. Normally, using any kind of product that many days would wreak havoc on my skin, break me out, and dry the eff out of my face. Surprisingly enough, no damage has been reported. I have naturally dry skin that is insanely flaky, so after I clean the mask off I just apply a thick coat of Look, No X Ma! cream. I use that stuff religiously, and after the mask it works just fine. Results! I do see it working on my face. At least, I hope it's the mask. The right side of my face had a TERRIBLE disgusting break out for like, 3 months. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, and have tried everything natural to get rid of it... all the products only agitated it more, which was infuriating. After I used the mask 4 days in a row, I saw things clearing up a bit. Then I got lazy and quit, because the mess is just such a hassle, but now my acne's gotten a bit worse. Back to the mask! OH also, DO NOT LAUGH while this mask is drying. I made the mistake of watching SNL once to pass the mask drying time. once. Never again. Also, we now have a thin layer of grey, green clay coating over everything in the house (mainly the computer desk). But fear not, this stuff wipes right off anything. No biggie. Also, I saw people complaining that this clay is a greenish grey color, which they took to be \"impure\" because it wasn't white (racists!) WELL I read on a website from this super knowledgeable person that the white stuff is actually the over-refined/bad quality clay, so THERE. I mean, they seemed to really know their stuff, so I'll just choose to believe them over researching it more. It's the American way! Hoped any of this helped .. someone. Just one person, even. That would be worth it. ...", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "Since there are so many reviews on the product itself, I thought I share one way to remove the mask. 1) Rip a paper towel to a size that can cover your face. 2) Wet the paper towel and lay it on your face. 3) Gently press the wet paper towel against your face with your hands to allow water to seep into the mask. 4) Press it for 15 to 30 seconds or until you can feel the mud can move on your skin. 5) Slowly wipe your face with the paper towel. You can easily remove a good chunk. 6) Turn on your faucet and let the water run very thin. 7) Close the stopper and try to open it very very very slightly so only water can escape. 8) Wash off the remaining mud that is left on your skin. 9) Turn off the faucet. Leave the sink the way it is. ***The water will be drained between the tiny gap while tiny mud pieces and particles will be plastered on the wall of the sink. ***** 10) Just take a paper towel and give a sink a good wipe. I hope this may help a few people.", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "I usually buy the big container of this as I use it for a few things. FACE MASK: Works amazing mixed with apple cider vinegar (ACV) until a thick consistency. I use the back of my spoon (use a wooden spoon) to slather on my face and neck and leave for 15 minutes (longer is NOT better, it is harder to get off). Then I get a big serving bowl and fill it will HOT water and use a face cloth to steam the mud loose to where it is easier to wipe off. Throw the mud water on some house plants, compost pile, or out the back door. It's good stuff for the soil too! It may take several application 1-3 times per week before you will see your pores shrink. I have seen several reviews here complaining of \"break outs\" from this product. Just a reminder, this clay pulls toxins through the skin to the surface, so in actuality, a \"break out\" is the result of a skin cleanse. Use a gentle moisturizer afterwards such as Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, Pura D'or Pure and Organic Argan Oil, Brown and Gold, 4 Fluid Ounce, or even Olive Oil,Og,Ex Virgin, 16 oz. Yes, these are all oils, but pure, organic, unrefined natural oils that do wonders for the skin. I've been interested in trying Olive Gold O3 Skin Care Lotion - Ozonated Olive Oil Super Oxygen (4oz) as I've heard wonderful things about this product. So let me know what you think if you do, my email is in my profile. TOOTH PASTE: I have a tooth powder recipe (email if you would like it) that is 80% bentonite clay. This clay is a wonderful mineral that helps remineralize my teeth. I've not needed to see a dentist in over 5 years. It has also, helped whiten my teeth, heal my gums, and prevent tooth decay. GASTRO/INTESTINAL DETOX: I've incorporated a bentonite clay and distilled water mixture (to drink) in the last 10 days of a fasting and was amazed at the garbage it pulled into my p**p (bowels). Bentonite clay is known to act as a magnet to heavy metals in your system. It helps draw these metals into your bowels to be eliminated. It's very strange the first time you do this, you may have a metallic taste in your mouth when this is accumulating. From childhood medications/vaccinations to a poor diet throughout our lives we have heavy metals stored in our organs, bones, and tissue, therefore to incorporate this \"magnet\" to any detox routine is very beneficial as Dr. Bernard Jensen discusses in his book Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management.", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "I am a long time bad acne sufferer (I'm talking nodular and cystic type of acne). Through a rigorous and strict skin care routine, I manage to prevent my face from looking like a pepperoni pizza. However, it's never 100% clear, especially during that time of the month when I would suffer a bad breakout. I started using this clay as a mask because reviews were very positive about how it helps with acne problems. Unfortunately for me, using it made me break out worse. I did mix it with apple cider vinegar. I put this mask on 2x/week. At first, I ignored the new pimples because I believe it's the purging. However, after 2 months, my faith was crushed and I realized it was still getting worse (not even leveling). I couldn't handle the depression of looking at my pepperoni pizza face in the mirror anymore and stopped using this. Luckily after another 3 months, my face finally recovered. So! Lesson here is be careful if you want to use this to help with acne. Realize that there are different types of acne (blackhead/whitehead/papules/pustular/nodular/cystic), and maybe those with nodular and cystic type like me won't benefit from this clay :(", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "Using this mask with just water or apple cider vinegar will definitely give you noticeably smoother skin for a short while but I didn't find it anything spectacular. Not one to needlessly waste anything I've purchased I decided to figure out some ways to improve this mask. I used up a whole tub of this clay trying many different ingredients and have come up with a few I am really fond of. LIQUID APPLE CIDER VINEGAR- The traditional way to use this mask. Others have extolled it virtues so I won't go into detail here, but it is a universally great choice for many skin types. ACV makes the smoothest and easiest to apply mixture as well. ROSE WATER - This is currently my preferred way to use this mask. Rosewater makes your face beautifully soft and it smells divine. Even better, rose water is anti-inflammatory and full of antioxidants. It is also balancing to both dry and oily skin. If you can't find plain rosewater a rosewater and glycerin toner can be used just as well. WITCH HAZEL - I use witch hazel when I'm battling breakouts. It's a mild astringent that doesn't dry out your skin like many other astringents have a tendency to do. ESSENTIAL OILS - I use 2 drops of each oil and generally use 1-2 oils per mask. TEA TREE - Perfect for those looking to use this mask as a way to control acne. A couple of drops of tea tree oil quickly stop pimples from getting any larger and helps dry them out in 1/3 of the time it usually takes. NEEM - Neem oil is known to be anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-inflammatory among other properties. It is wonderful for those with acne-prone skin, dry skin and conditions like eczema. CHAMOMILE - This oil is anti-inflammatory and will help to reduce redness in your face. I use this when my skin is chapped from harsh winter weather. LAVENDER - Soothing and softening, lavender is not just good for your skin, but a couple of drops will also mask the overwhelming scents of apple cider vinegar, tea tree and/or neem oils. OTHER ADDITIONS Activated Charcoal - Activated charcoal takes the purifying qualities of this mask and bumps it up a few dozen notches. Activated charcoal makes for an incredible mask on its own, but is quite messy and can be difficult to remove from your skin. A better way to benefit from its properties is to take a a capsule, break it open and add 1/2 to 1 capsule of charcoal into the mask. Just search for 'activated charcoal capsule' if you aren't familiar with the product. Oatmeal - Oatmeal is well-known for its moisturizing properties so if you have dry skin adding some oatmeal flour is a helpful addition. You can take plain (NOT flavored/sugared pouches) oatmeal and run it through your food processor until pretty fine. It doesn't need to be perfectly evenly ground. You can also add the oat flour you find in bags in the flour aisle of the grocery store. Honey - Excellent for moisturizing your skin as well as treating acne as honey is antibacterial. Honey is also full of antioxidants which are beneficial to your skin. Honey is also anti-inflammatory. Don't be scared, it rinses off cleanly with just warm water and leaves no sticky residue. Use raw honey for the best results. I hope this has helped you some!", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "Cured my acne from hormonal imbalance. My skin is like new again. I use only twice a week. It also has healed old acne scars and makes my skin less oily.", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "Okay, let's get down to it: There are hundreds of rave reviews on this product, and like many other people reading through these, I thought it was too good to be true. But hey, it's cheap, and it's natural--where can you go wrong? I figured worst case scenario, I'd end up tossing it. Less than ten dollars, not that bad, right? Here's the rundown: My skin is difficult. It's sensitive to certain products and is somehow simultaneously really oily in the T-zone and really dry along my cheeks and chin. I've got blackheads all over my nose and three or four sizeable whiteheads on my face at any given time. I've also had dozens of very small bumps on my forehead for years. When I saw the reviewers of this product claiming that it made the pimples pop out of your face, I got a bit excited. Here's what really happened to me: I started using the mask every other day, moisturizing well with Clinique's dramatically different moisturizing gel after every use. I found that while pimples weren't exactly popping out of my face, the mask did do a very good job of purifying my skin OVER TIME. What do I mean by that? The big pimples that I had got a bit bigger, and were gone within a few days. More importantly, the small bumps I've had on my forehead that I've never been able to get rid of? Within two uses (three days) they'd developed into full-fledged whiteheads. Then, a few days after that, they were GONE. And I mean, 100% gone, no sign they were ever there in the first place, and I've had those for YEARS. This clay doesn't kill the bacteria in your acne so much as it brings it to the surface--a process that is actually a lot better for your skin than killing the pimples with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. It will make you break out because it is in fact purging your skin of all those nasty toxins. Once the pimples have developed fully, I would recommend using a comedone extractor (can also be found on amazon--I got mine for $0.79 and free shipping) to extract them, and then swiping over with a toner of your choice (that's when you use salicylic acid or BP--in the toner.) Your pimple should be gone within a day or so. I've found that using this clay every other day to start with is very good, if a bit hard on the skin. Just remember to moisturize well after each application. After the initial purge is over, maybe switch to using it once or twice a week, just to maintain. It's a good preventative treatment in the long term, because it doesn't let the toxins in your skin develop long enough to turn into full-fledged pimples. If there's bacteria, it's coming out. After the initial purge I stopped breaking out altogether, and I know it was mostly thanks to this mask because I stopped using it for a month or so and my acne came back full-force. I mix it one part clay powder to one part Bragg's organic ACV with \"the mother.\" I use two teaspoons of each clay powder and ACV, because I've found that the mask DOES work better if you put it on very thickly. I spread it on my face with my fingers and then use an old paddle foundation brush to smooth it out and attempt to even out the coverage. I then leave it on for half an hour. BEFORE PUTTING IT ON: make sure to thoroughly cleanse your face. DO NOT moisturize or tone--NOTHING. I've found that it works a lot better if you run a washcloth under hot water, wring it out, and press it to your face to open your pores. Leaves your face slightly damp and your pores open as an excellent prep for the mask. Set the wet washcloth aside in order to take off the mask. TO TAKE IT OFF: I read in the reviews here that a lot of people had trouble taking the mask off. In the beginning, I tried wetting my hands and slowly peeling off the chunks. Not only was it nearly impossible, but it hurt too. I've found that if you take the same washcloth you used to prep your face before the mask and run it under warm water, then press it into your face to loosen the mask, it comes off easily! Just wet the mask and when it's loose rub in circular motions with the washcloth and it comes RIGHT OFF. If it's not coming off, that just means you need more water! In conclusion: this mask is fantastic. It's not a miracle, but it works VERY well, especially for the price. Make sure you know how to use it and be smart about your expectations. You shouldn't be disappointed. Good luck!", "id": 11061001}
{"review": "Short story - The Foot cream is better for your feet. Long story... I did a bit of research and learned that the foot cream contained a higher concentration of Allantoin which helps it get absorbed better through thicker skin. Then I did a side by side, actually foot by foot, comparison. Each night I put the foot cream on my left foot and the hand cream on my right foot. After four days both feet showed improvement. However, my left foot, the one where I used foot cream, looked a bit better. By comparison, my right foot got considerably better at playing the piano. Seriously, the foot cream works remarkably well. Also, you need both consider getting just the feet cream. In addition to working better on your feet you wind up applying it to our hands in the process. BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can. I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was missing or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.", "id": 3780041}
{"review": "I have tried everything for my cracked heals. From creams from the doctors to soaking my feet in oils and nothing worked. I use this product three times and my feet look hundred times better. I do not write reviews but I have to mention this cream IT. IS. A MA ZING!!!!!", "id": 3780041}
{"review": "I ordered O'Keeffe's Working Hands and the seller sent a free jar of Healthy Feet. My feet were cracked and my heels were rough enough to tear nylons. 3 nights ago I started applying Healthy Feet after my shower. Tonight being the 4th night, as I sat down to apply it, I noticed my feet were as smooth as a baby's behind. All Calluses were gone. This is the best and I can't thank the seller enough for sending it. I will be buying more. If you have tried other products for your feet, you have to try this. It will work. It is also 100% guranteed to work. They will buy it back if it does not. I have spent a small fortune on lotions and cremes and I am sure many of you have too. Give this a try, you won't be disappointed.", "id": 3780041}
{"review": "Just a bit history about my situation. My feet and heel have been dried for years, and my heel is the worst shape that has been bothering me not just for the cosmetic alone but the sensation of my skin being torn apart is a super unpleasant experience. I have tried some super fancy, expensive lotion for my heel made in France, Germany, and other parts of the world. Nothing worked, I also tried some dirt cheap lotion that I purchased from the local drug store, no miracle has happened. I talked to my doctor about this situation and all he has told me, is to try oil-based lotion but again, it failed. I literally gave up all my hope until I accidentally found this cream from Amazon. Just like many others, I was a bit skeptical about it due to its low price and overwhelming positive responses (some reviewers get paid for writing up positive reviews), then I thought, it's so cheap and if it doesn't work, I just toss it away. Guess what? I've used it for only 5 days and boy, let me tell you, it has helped the way that NO OTHER lotions that I have tried would yield the same result / performance. My heel and lower leg is so much softer and the skin is obviously more tender when touched. I feel so much more comfortable when I'm wearing my socks. I basically apply the lotion twice a day. Once right after I shower at night, and another application in the early morning before I go to work. If I have known this cream years back, I would have been a much happier person. Please, if you have similar issues as what I have, give this a try. You will NOT regret it!!! Even if it doesn't work for you, the way it works for me, but you should see a significant improvement. The bottom line is, how much are you going to lose if it doesn't work? $7?!!! you get a couple of fancy Starbucks latte for way more than that. Why not giving it a try? I hope my review helps and if it does, please rate me or put in a few good words for me. I'd be very grateful. :) James, Santa Clara, California.", "id": 3780041}
{"review": "To tell you the truth, I didn't fully believe all of the hype but decided to try this out of sheer desperation. My feet were so dry, cracked and painful from the brutal winter I couldn't stand it. This cream is absolutely wonderful! After 2 or 3 applications, my feet are like a baby's but! The BEST part is that this cream has absolutely no irritating scent. It doesn't seem to have any odor whatsoever! I cannot stand the smell of other foot care products. No matter how pleasant, after awhile, it gets to be too much. I also love the creamy texture, bright blue container and the rubber grip on the top of the jar, so you can screw the lid on tightly with greasy hands. It does leave a little bit of slippery residue behind but that's to be expected from any decently hydrating moisturizer. I will NEVER buy anything else and I am going to buy the six pack to get the most for my money. Try it...you won't regret it! ******************************************************************************************* UPDATE: 11/15/10 I just received another order and I am very disappointed. This container is smaller than previous ones. I wish I had saved an old container to compare sizes. And- the cream seems thinner, almost \"watered down\" compared to previous containers. Also, it is not nearly as effective. Normally, after 1 or 2 applications, I can see a huge difference. I have applied this for 4 or 5 nights and there is SOME improvement, but not nearly like before. Plus, I've used 1/2 the container already. At 10 bucks a pop, I don't think it's worth it. Shame on you, O'Keefe's for ruining a good thing!!!", "id": 3780041}

{"review": "I am a faithful user of bag, palm for after care, on my home made - pedicures. Bag Balm is a product used on utters of cows. To keep them from dry and splitting, after milking. Hence the name of the products. Bag Balm is a product that has crept it's way into human use, like Mane -n- tail, has for our hair. BAG BALM WORKS WONDERS After seeing O'Keefe ads, I decided to give it a try. This is more of a cream, than a balm. So it will not be a thick layer, for your feet. It's pretty much like Bath and Body Works, body cream, with a few more emollients added. It's a fairly good product, but not the instant quick fix, of Bag Balm or even, soaking your feet in NETTLE OIL ( after buffing them, with a pumice and loofah). It's a good product for mildly cracked feet, for severely cracked feet, I would say go with bag balm, and oil soaking, to cure that condition. And start taking a vitamin supplement for your skin, or eat more spinach, collards, and kale, to help with your skin. And a few times a month have fresh water salmon.", "id": 3780041}

{"review": "I probably have tried over 20 different foot creams in the last couple of years, trying to find \"the best one\". This sure isn't it. I applied it in bed at night as the instructions suggest. As I laid there trying to fall asleep my feet started burning a little bit from this cream. Anyway, at some point I did fall asleep and when I woke up the next morning my feet felt hot and dry and kind of chalky. Anyway, I prefer moisturizing creams with peppermint or tea tree that provide a nice cooling sensation. There is NO Cooling sensation with this hard chalky cream, only hot and dry feeling. Honestly for Moisturizing, Curel Foot Therapy is the best cream out of all the ones I've tried, and for Cooling probably Earth Therapeutics Reflexology Foot Massage lotion. So when my feet feel dry I use the Curel and in the summer when it's hot at night and hard to sleep I use the Earth Therapeutics Reflexology lotion because it cools down your feet and makes it easier to sleep. And neither one will ever make your feet feel \"hot and dry\" or \"chalky\"", "id": 3780041}

Though the idea is interesting - what would happen if you could suddenly read people's thoughts - the concept is weighed down with poor characterization, stereotypical characters and a horrendous lack of editing. It reads as if someone used spell check and decided that was sufficient editing. I got about a third of the way through this book before I gave up. I had no idea who the main character was. Her relationships with her family were barely sketched in, and I have no idea what motivates this character. I was also irritated by her anger at her husband over another woman being interested in him even though he did not reciprocate, while she's being swoony over the police officer. I remember reading a considerable amount of mommy mysteries about a decade ago so it is not as though I object to the genre, but there are much better examples of this particular type available.

{"review": "One of the main reasons I selected this novel was due, in part, to the cover. People really do judge books by its cover. Having said that, I wasn't that thrilled with the story. But to be fair, I thought this story was going to be a real page turner seeing as how the main character, Shelby Nichols, was on her way to the grocery store to pick up some carrots to make chicken noodle soup for her family. While going down the aisles, she grabs her carrots and gets some other items, takes her basket to the checkout line, and she hears a loud POW! A crazed man with a gun is holding up the bank, and begins shooting all over the place, and instead of Shelby ducking and taking cover like the other patrons did, she stood and watched--out of shock or could that be pure stupidity, whichever you prefer? At any rate, the next thing she remembers is a paramedic over her asking her questions, but she could barely make out what he was saying. She just wanted her carrots, but what was that trickling down her forehead? Blood! What had happened and why couldn't she just go home? Turns out Shelby was grazed by one of the stray bullets by the armed robber, and as luck would have it, or a curse, as some might think, she begins to know exactly what everyone is thinking, even though their mouths aren't moving, but she hears their thoughts. Now, that sounds exciting, right? Well, it was until the story seemed to take on an immaturity level and Shelby just seemed to get dumber as the pages grew. I found myself not liking this character, and I so wanted too. She did things that were just plain stupid, and there were things that happened in different scenarios that didn't seem to add up or there wasn't any rhyme or reason behind it. The story was written well, but I wish the main character wasn't so quirky. This isn't a bad read, I guess it just wasn't for me. If you like a ditzy character, then I'm sure you'll like this book.", "id": 17}

The humor was a little forced in the beginning, but I did laugh out loud twice later in the book. The author skipped all sorts of cliches in the character and thoughts of the husband, which I greatly appreciated. The portraits of some minor characters were more complex than expected, as were some of the genuinely surprising plot twists. I had a hard time believing the heroine was in her mid-thirties and the mother of two older kids; she seemed much younger to me. Actually, she seemed slightly stunted. She didn't know some fairly basic social covenants and had no real moral compass. She also seemed awfully isolated. Yes, she is supposed to be a full time mom, but her kids are pre-teen and young-teen. What does she do why they are in school all day? And why doesn't she have any friends? However, I was engrossed in this story and eager to know how it turned out. Bottom line, I just bought the next book, Fast Money, and am diving right in.", "id": 17}

{"review": "This book is about 3 families and their struggles during WWII. A Jewish man is mad at God for taking his wife. Two children are traumatized by their mothers death and decision by their Dad to go to war. Adult Penny and her sister were verbally abused by their parents. This book was really hard to read because of the emotional pounding everyone gets for the first half of the book. No bright spots, just emotional beating after beating. It lightens up a little after that, and the last 3 chapters everything was tied up in a tidy bow. Except for the Jewish man, I felt that all of the trauma was too easily overcome and settled. This is not one of Lynn Austin's better books, it was a relief when I finally got to the end.", "id": 7259434011}

{"review": "Over the weekend, I described Lynn Austin's recent book, While We're Far Apart, like an intricate symphony. It begins with a rather straightforward melody: Penny watches as the man she pines for leaves for War on the eve of the American involvement in WWII and offers recklessly to take care of his two motherless children in hopes of securing his love upon his return from duty. Shaking feelings of worthlessness long instilled from her over-bearing parents, Penny steps outside the front door of the house she has always lived in and charges toward a new future. On the eve of his departure, widowed Eddie tries to ignore the pleas of his two young children begging him to stay. They don't want Penny to move into their Brooklyn Apartment and usurp their dead mother's space. They, instead, want their father to stay home from the war. Eddie leaves to converse with Jacob Mendel, his Jewish landlord and another tune strings in. Jacob's wife Miriam and Eddie's wife Rachel were both killed in the same untimely accident. As ramification, Jacob has lost his faith in Hashem ---- God seems so far away although the rabbi and his wife try desperately to tug the former elder back to the life of the synagogue. And then, climactically and with discordance, the local synagogue is prey to an act of arson and a seemingly faraway hatred is brandished like a cymbal- jolt into the present. The tune evokes a haunting change as more instruments are melded into each deft cadence and more bars are added to prolong the unraveling symphony. Dense orchestration including the introduction of new friends; wisps of letters from Jacob's son and his wife in war-torn, Holocaust Hungary, and deep whispers of secrets from loved ones near and far merge to create a seamless piece. There are themes of love and pursuit; of anger, of hatred of a clashing war. Of the brisk touch of this world and the world beyond. It is an almost perfect rendering of a tumultuous time. Austin never writes without an over-arching theme and in While We're Far Apart, the seeming absence of God is most resonant. Jacob followed and meditated on the words of the Torah steadfastly only to find the seams of his world tearing and his life falling apart. Penny isn't sure how to believe in God: when she repeats over and over again all of her shortcomings. Young Esther and her wordless brother Peter go through the motions of a Sunday Schooled upbringing attempting to reconcile the death of their mother with the faith she seemed to inspire in them. All lives collide and cross--- and yet the Almighty seems painfully silent. While We're Far Apart is a magnificent exposition of God in all of his seeming silences. Is He there when we can't hear Him? ---There whether in the materialization of Christian or Jewish tradition? Even amidst a Holocaust recalling the treacherous reign of Haman and the unlikely heroism of Queen Esther? Amidst persecution, death and unwarranted vandalism? How can we pick up the pieces of our faith if we're not sure where faith leads? What is God doing behind the scenes and how are His silences even more telling than His revelation? The end of the song, the end of the book, empowers the reader to think of God in a personal and enraptured way. He can handle our anger and our despair: our lashings out and our pain..... for it is in these moments that we test our faith to breaking point, shirk any complacency and recognize that years later, when the glass is undimmed, that He was there working out the technical aspects, the last strains and chords of melody and sewing together a music so beautiful our human ears could scarce imagine it.", "id": 7259434011}

{"review": "The novel opens in Brooklyn, New York in the fall of 1943 during WWII. Eddie Schaffer age 33 and his two children, 12-year-old Esther and 9-year-old Peter live in a small apartment upstairs from their landlord, Jacob Mendel. A year prior, Eddie's wife Rachel was killed together with his landlord's wife, Miriam. Eddie is having difficulty coping with Rachel's death and decides to enlist in the army throwing the entire family for a loop. The children had already lost their mother and feared losing their father in battle. Eddie's mother, Grandma Shaffer, lives next door to the Goodrich family who has a daughter Penny, aged 24. Penny's parents are older, quite strict and have sheltered Penny her entire life, always telling her she had no more sense than a green bean. As a result poor Penny suffers from terrible fear of being on her own and afraid of the world at large, although she holds a job as a ticket agent at the local bus station. Unbeknownst to Eddie, Penny has had a crush on him for years and years and always wished Eddie had married her instead of Rachel. She cried her eyes out when she learned Eddie was getting married. Now enlisted in the Army and ready to head off for basic training, Eddie needs someone to care for young Esther and Peter. His own mother, Grandma Shaffer is adamant that there is no way possible she can look after two young children and is completely dead set against Eddie enlisting but Eddie had already enlisted sending Grandma into quite a dramatic tizzy. Penny steps forward and offers to care for the children herself with her underlying motive being that Eddie will fall in love with her and marry HER this time. Soon Penny and children are ensconced in Eddie's apartment, living above Jacob Mendel who is suffering with his own problems. His son, Avraham traveled to Hungary five years ago to study the Torah, met and married Sarah and they had a daughter together whom they named Fredeleh, but now all three of them are missing! Young Esther is struggling in Sunday school asking the teacher why there are wars, why her mother died in the car accident and asks: \"Why doesn't God just kill all the evil people himself\". Her teacher tells the class they should pray for their loved ones who are off fighting in the war but Esther can't accept that as an answer and inquires: \"Even if we pray and pray, God doesn't stop people from dying, so what good does it do\"? How many of us have asked that very same question during our own journey of faith? In the meantime, poor little Peter seems to have lost his ability to talk once his father went off to war and is frightened. He writes a note on his chalkboard for his sister saying: \"I don't know what's wrong. I try to talk and nothing comes out. Help me!\" Esther doesn't know what to do and won't ask Penny for any help as she despises Penny and thinks that she is trying to replace her mother. But Penny, at this point, couldn't be much help as she herself has no self-confidence, always telling herself she can't do things and always makes a mess of everything. These put-downs are old tapes playing in her head that her parents have pounded into her since she was a young child. They continue to treat Penny as a child and make her feel as though everything that happens is her fault. Yet somehow she found the inner strength and courage to move out of her parents home and care for Eddie's children. Downstairs, Jacob Mendel has lost his Jewish faith completely. Esther and Peter visit Mr. Mendel after school each day to help him around the house. Esther begins to seek answers about God, prayer and faith from Mr. Mendel but he doesn't know how to help Esther or what to say to her. He too has lost faith in his religion and his God. He finally explains the story of Joseph and the coat of many colours and tells the children that: \"Faith is believing even when you cannot see it\". But, does Jacob himself still really believe that? Due to Esther's persistence and questions, and Peter's sad eyes, Jacob was beginning to come out from under the veil of darkness and unbelief he had been under for the past year and a half. Jacob decides that he and the children will invite Penny in celebrating \"Purim\", which is the feast of \"Queen Esther\" from the Bible. Keeping with tradition, Jacob tells the children that instead of him telling the story, they will each read the story together with everyone taking a part. Of course, Esther will play the part of Queen Esther and Peter will be Hashem (The Man or God). They will also bake the traditional \"Hamantaschen\" (cookies). During Jacob's planning of the party he realizes he is truly happy. As the relationship between Mr. Mendel, the children and Penny begins to grow, they come to learn together about faith, loss, love, and forgiveness. There are so many other exciting parts in this story that I don't want to give anything else away. But there are a few morals in this story that I believe are important for all of us to remember. We need to remember that God is always there, even when we can't see Him or hear Him. Even when we think our prayers are not being heard, they are, just not always in the way we'd like them to be. It is and has always been God's will that shall be done, not ours! Even during silence and painful hardships, God is still there. Sometimes we must travel through hardships in our lives in order for us to learn something or to understand something. Without hardships we wouldn't be able to grow in our faith. We need to trust God and live our lives as humble servants, even when we cannot see, even when we feel tired of looking and want to give up. God is ALWAYS there, even when He is silent. This is also an important story that talks about the atrocities that were placed upon the people of Jewish faith during the war, in my opinion, one of the saddest and most hurtful of all times in history. Lynn Austin has once again written a riveting story. A story that you'll remember long after the last page has been turned. It's the type of book you'll want to read again and again. This is one story you can't miss!!", "id": 7259434011}

Jacob decides that he and the children will invite Penny in celebrating \"Purim\", which is the feast of \"Queen Esther\" from the Bible. Keeping with tradition, Jacob tells the children that instead of him telling the story, they will each read the story together with everyone taking a part. Of course, Esther will play the part of Queen Esther and Peter will be Hashem (The Man or God). They will also bake the traditional \"Hamantaschen\" (cookies). During Jacob's planning of the party he realizes he is truly happy. As the relationship between Mr. Mendel, the children and Penny begins to grow, they come to learn together about faith, loss, love, and forgiveness. There are so many other exciting parts in this story that I don't want to give anything else away. But there are a few morals in this story that I believe are important for all of us to remember. We need to remember that God is always there, even when we can't see Him or hear Him. Even when we think our prayers are not being heard, they are, just not always in the way we'd like them to be. It is and has always been God's will that shall be done, not ours! Even during silence and painful hardships, God is still there. Sometimes we must travel through hardships in our lives in order for us to learn something or to understand something. Without hardships we wouldn't be able to grow in our faith. We need to trust God and live our lives as humble servants, even when we cannot see, even when we feel tired of looking and want to give up. God is ALWAYS there, even when He is silent. This is also an important story that talks about the atrocities that were placed upon the people of Jewish faith during the war, in my opinion, one of the saddest and most hurtful of all times in history. Lynn Austin has once again written a riveting story. A story that you'll remember long after the last page has been turned. It's the type of book you'll want to read again and again.

{"review": "The novel opens in Brooklyn, New York in the fall of 1943 during WWII. Eddie Schaffer age 33 and his two children, 12-year-old Esther and 9-year-old Peter live in a small apartment upstairs from their landlord, Jacob Mendel. A year prior, Eddie's wife Rachel was killed together with his landlord's wife, Miriam. Eddie is having difficulty coping with Rachel's death and decides to enlist in the army throwing the entire family for a loop. The children had already lost their mother and feared losing their father in battle. Eddie's mother, Grandma Shaffer, lives next door to the Goodrich family who has a daughter Penny, aged 24. Penny's parents are older, quite strict and have sheltered Penny her entire life, always telling her she had no more sense than a green bean. As a result poor Penny suffers from terrible fear of being on her own and afraid of the world at large, although she holds a job as a ticket agent at the local bus station. Unbeknownst to Eddie, Penny has had a crush on him for years and years and always wished Eddie had married her instead of Rachel. She cried her eyes out when she learned Eddie was getting married. Now enlisted in the Army and ready to head off for basic training, Eddie needs someone to care for young Esther and Peter. His own mother, Grandma Shaffer is adamant that there is no way possible she can look after two young children and is completely dead set against Eddie enlisting but Eddie had already enlisted sending Grandma into quite a dramatic tizzy. Penny steps forward and offers to care for the children herself with her underlying motive being that Eddie will fall in love with her and marry HER this time. Soon Penny and children are ensconced in Eddie's apartment, living above Jacob Mendel who is suffering with his own problems. His son, Avraham traveled to Hungary five years ago to study the Torah, met and married Sarah and they had a daughter together whom they named Fredeleh, but now all three of them are missing! Young Esther is struggling in Sunday school asking the teacher why there are wars, why her mother died in the car accident and asks: \"Why doesn't God just kill all the evil people himself\". Her teacher tells the class they should pray for their loved ones who are off fighting in the war but Esther can't accept that as an answer and inquires: \"Even if we pray and pray, God doesn't stop people from dying, so what good does it do\"? How many of us have asked that very same question during our own journey of faith? In the meantime, poor little Peter seems to have lost his ability to talk once his father went off to war and is frightened. He writes a note on his chalkboard for his sister saying: \"I don't know what's wrong. I try to talk and nothing comes out. Help me!\" Esther doesn't know what to do and won't ask Penny for any help as she despises Penny and thinks that she is trying to replace her mother. But Penny, at this point, couldn't be much help as she herself has no self-confidence, always telling herself she can't do things and always makes a mess of everything. These put-downs are old tapes playing in her head that her parents have pounded into her since she was a young child. They continue to treat Penny as a child and make her feel as though everything that happens is her fault. Yet somehow she found the inner strength and courage to move out of her parents home and care for Eddie's children. Downstairs, Jacob Mendel has lost his Jewish faith completely. Esther and Peter visit Mr. Mendel after school each day to help him around the house. Esther begins to seek answers about God, prayer and faith from Mr. Mendel but he doesn't know how to help Esther or what to say to her. He too has lost faith in his religion and his God. He finally explains the story of Joseph and the coat of many colours and tells the children that: \"Faith is believing even when you cannot see it\". But, does Jacob himself still really believe that? Due to Esther's persistence and questions, and Peter's sad eyes, Jacob was beginning to come out from under the veil of darkness and unbelief he had been under for the past year and a half.

{"review": "Excited by the description and the stellar reviews, I was eager to pick this one up. It was a quick read but in the end lacked the complexity and content that one would expect. I might recommend this book for a mature 6th-grader writing a book report, but as an adult I was disappointed. While the book is clearly character driven (the descriptions of the \"Brooklyn\" setting could have been Anywhere, USA), the characters themselves seemed to be so stereotypical and poorly developed beyond the basics: the struggling middle-class family, the young enthusiastic soldier, the orthodox Jew, the closed-minded bigot, etc. The letters from Hungary, describing the plight of a Jewish family during the Nazi occupation, felt mostly like a tool for the author to educate the reader about basic WWII history rather than supplement the story. What was most unappealing was the simplistic nature of the characters and dialogue; essentially boiled down to a young adult level but with the serious overtones of an adult topic. Overall the development of the book was overly thin and predictable, and the ending a little too saccharine for me to swallow.

{"review": "I love Lynn Austin, so I had high hopes for this book. Though I don't think it was quite as good as some of her other books (Refiner's Fire series), I did enjoy it. I love that the \"Far Apart\" theme was carried out in many ways through the various characters and the fact that Mr. Mendel kept reinforcing the idea that we should stop at nothing to find those we love. The author did a good job developing the characters. I genuinely cared about what happened to them and felt the anguish of Esther as she desperately searched the news for information about the area her father was. Mr. Mendel was probably my favorite character. I felt his heartache throughout the book and loved how he grew as a person throughout the story.", "id": 7259434011}

{"review": "GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I am having the time of my life right now. My facebook page dedicated to the blog has hit over 2000 likes so throwing a big party on October 4th. So having fun getting authors together and scheduling their mini take overs . Also reading up a storm. Have so many books coming down the pipe. Might have to hook up with some awesome reviewers. So todays book is THE WAYEVIL DOES (the first book in the Eisenbrey trilogy:) By Amara Draska BOOK BLURB Rebecca Reis considers abandoning her career as a novelist until she begins writing about convicted serial killer Thomas Eisenbrey. Nicknamed the Hunter because of his penchant for targeting groups of hunters in the forest, Eisenbrey is the worst kind of psychopath. He is crafty, aloof, at times possessing a charm that is almost hypnotizing, and he’s wheedling his way into her mind. As her interviews with him in the Washington State Penitentiary progress, Rebecca finds herself having feelings for the last man in the world that she should, forcing her to ignore her attraction to the detective who is also vying for her affection. But when the Hunter escapes, she worries—who will he hunt next? MY REVIEW I was so excited when I got this book. It has everything a little bit of romance a hot detective a psychopath killer named THE HUNTER who is rather dashing and charming but also very crafty. He is slowly getting into the mind of Rebecca the reporter sent to interview him. She is sent to the State pen to interview him and as the interviews progress she finds that she is starting to fall for the debonair killer But there is also the very hot detective that also wants her. But she is scared that when the hunter escapes who will he go after and will she live to see another day. The author takes us on a ride that will end up reading all night long. This has a romance, serial killers , murders and a twist of paranormal. The characters are so well written . You feel for them and start to care for them. I must admit I did like Thomas even though he was a serial killer and probably want to stab me to death. He did kind a get under your skin while you read. I didn't think that all the aspects would work but it did. Even the twist of paranormal . It does and trust me you will be drawn into hell and back and yes there is a cliff hanger but not a big of one that will make you scream. This book will keep you up all night reading. Hope you are ready for a big book hangover. So check out this book and check out the great story lines characters and wonderful plots. I promise you will not be disappointed", "id": 17}

{"review": "I purchased this book having read (and LOVED) The Girl in the Italian Bakery. Strangeville was a nice light read - although it starts off with quite a bang where the main character is on his way to the White Mountains to kill himself - it becomes an entertaining SCIFi meets Mayberry RFD tale after that. I enjoyed the book and the quirky characters. I am looking forward to more books by Kenneth and I was especially happy to see that the book is benefitting great causes as well!

{"review": "For a first time author, I was very pleasantly surprised. The first two pages had me totally hooked and from then on I was taken on a thrilling ride through not only the far north of New Zealand but the snow-covered central plateau. Matt Cairns has cleverly woven a story of good versus evil. He has used his previous experience as both soldier and policeman to excellent effect and he draws the reader in to a world that few talk about ... experimentation to enhance human strength and abilities. At times this book is scary ... it is also moving and funny. I absolutely enjoyed it and all the characters had depth and were totally believable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure and thriller which borders somewhat on the dark and mysterious. I look forward to more books by this author.", "id": 49}

At times this book is scary ... it is also moving and funny. I absolutely enjoyed it and all the characters had depth and were totally believable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good adventure and thriller which borders somewhat on the dark and mysterious. I look forward to more books by this author.", "id": 9059890011}

{"review": "As per other reviewers I couldn't put this book down. I loved the vivid imagery and the plot as it thickened along with its characters. For anyone who has traveled the central plateau of New Zealand and stopped in Waiouru to re-fuel, grab a bite to eat, visit the army museum or check for road closures - you will recognise the scenery depicted in Matt's story line. If you are an ex-service person or army brat who lived in Waiouru you will feel at home, recognise the key landmarks Matt describes and through his use of descriptive language be able to picture exactly where the characters are placed. From the Chinese takeaway to the watch house and the road closure gates. I'm not a fan of the genre and wouldn't normally have pursued the book, but Matt kept me interested in the other details that surrounded the cold blooded thriller so i could move through the aspects that I don't enjoy reading about. After devouring the book when i could over the past two days, I am now left wanting more. Hurry up Matt and get the next one sorted! :-)", "id": 49}

Plus it's just plain fun to read.

{"review": "Susan Baroncini-Moe claims that this book is for small business entrepreneurs. That's where she's wrong. I say this book is for small business entrepreneurs AND anyone who is willing to work hard to chase a dream. I'm not starting a business. What I am is a blogger and an indie author, someone with aspirations, and this book is relevant to my needs and what I want to accomplish. Very shortly after I dug into the first chapter, I had to put the book down and run to get a pencil and colored tabs so I could start marking pages and underlining sentences. Even before I finished reading, I had a chance to speak with a friend who is in the beginning stages of starting a web comic, and I couldn't help but recommend this book to her. The author writes in a companionable tone, and the text is divided into brief sections, and when you combine those two factors, you get easy, fast reading. What I usually expect from a business book is stuffy formality, but I got none of that here. Instead, what I got was straightforward information and practical examples, all packaged in conversational-style writing. I've finished reading the book, but I'm nowhere near done with it. Next I get to explore the companion website, and I'm going to go back through the book and take the time to work on the homework assignments that appear throughout the text. There must be something terribly wrong: I'm feeling excited about doing homework. What has Susan done to me?! Whether you're looking into starting a small business or a chasing a dream that needs a lot of elbow grease and focus, this book will be of practical use to you. Trust me: I know a little about dream chasing.", "id": 2702}

Very shortly after I dug into the first chapter, I had to put the book down and run to get a pencil and colored tabs so I could start marking pages and underlining sentences. Even before I finished reading, I had a chance to speak with a friend who is in the beginning stages of starting a web comic, and I couldn't help but recommend this book to her. The author writes in a companionable tone, and the text is divided into brief sections, and when you combine those two factors, you get easy, fast reading. What I usually expect from a business book is stuffy formality, but I got none of that here. Instead, what I got was straightforward information and practical examples, all packaged in conversational-style writing. I've finished reading the book, but I'm nowhere near done with it. Next I get to explore the companion website, and I'm going to go back through the book and take the time to work on the homework assignments that appear throughout the text. There must be something terribly wrong: I'm feeling excited about doing homework. What has Susan done to me?! Whether you're looking into starting a small business or a chasing a dream that needs a lot of elbow grease and focus, this book will be of practical use to you. Trust me: I know a little about dream chasing.", "id": 355574011}

Entrepreneurship is the backbone of our economy, and it offers virtually anyone unlimited opportunity, income, and freedom. But like anything worth pursuing, it requires effort,\" Susan Baroncini-Moe states in her book, \"Business in Blue Jeans - How to Have a Successful Business on Your Own Terms, in Your Own Style.\" This two hundred and thirty page hardbound book is targeted not only toward one who wants to start up a new business venture, it aids in successful growth of an existing business. With a plethora of positive reviews on the back jacket cover and six pages at the beginning of the book, Baroncini-Moe knows strategies and marketing techniques to start or stay in business. After the introduction, the book is separated into six parts that walks the \"newbie\" or existing business owner through starting or revamping their trade. Stating one has \"brain junk\" that stops him or her from being successful, one needs to work on dealing with negativity to get to the next step in business, drawing the line regarding core values that may include politics or religion. Almost every chapter has homework assignments for both novice and veteran, some with her own tried examples yet there are no easy fill-in-the-blank or self-help tests for guidance. At the end there is a six page index and invitation to join her online website for more information. The author describes in detail the fire inside that is based on motivation and inspiration and how to stroke the embers when the fire wanes. Through expertise and packaging, one can learn how to lean into marketing by village networking. As a fan of meditation, she promotes having a \"dream to reality\" book, an inventory of success and a \" plan of whys\" to facilitate finding a happy medium in business to maintain being true to oneself. Correlating a business owner's progress to a kitchen sink, she concentrates on keeping time journals, knowing explicit target markets, having a ten focus group, and brainstorming with peers. By getting the reader to write out detailed thoughts, dreams, goals and expectations in each chapter regarding his or her business, no doubt one will be more tuned in to its successes, improvements and future direction. With it obviously working well for Baroncini-Moe, one can glean much information that can be applied to a new start up or floundering business that needs energizing.

{"review": "I could get past the spyware app written by a former model. I could get past the texting and insta romance. I could get over the bizarre backstory of Jax getting messed over (out of a stunt contract) by a woman he was dating. I could try and overlook the \"I can't be seen with you\" text from Lexi which should have ended the story (who would want to be with such a mean and flawed woman). What I couldn't get over was the oddly fabricated and ineffective point of tension that was suppose to keep the hero and heroine apart. Romance books are far from believable, and are often meant to offer a total escape. That said, the storyline should make sense and the point of contention that causes drama should have an element of believability. It this case, it made absolutely no sense whatsoever that Lexi couldn't be with Jax, and that any fashion house would shun her dating him (or have a say). Most publicity is good publicity, so it would have actually been a huge plus for the added media attention. I can't recommend Reckless, and it was a book I had to give up on while reading.", "id": 10129}

{"review": "Lexi needs a man to mix it up a little. She's all about being in control and having her life and career in order. That is until Miss Perfect meets hot Biker Boy. This is one man who can shake her life up, and rock it hard, too. I loved him from the cover, and I loved him from chapter one. Super fine and sexy, rugged and tatted, Jax is more than that rough-looking bad boy image. He's also one very sweet hero. The kind of man who needs care and wants love really badly, and I love those heroes. I do love me a needy hero. Who can resist a man who's open and ready to love? Jax very much wants a girl who will love and respect him, treat him right, and not walk all over him. Now, don't think he's a wuss. He's not. He's just used to being used, and I felt for him. He's had his share of action, lots of beautiful women, always attracted to their flashy exterior, but now he's going to turn it around and find himself a woman who can be sweet and kind and not use him for gain and ulterior motive. How he meets the heroine is interesting and fun and playful, kind of secret, with some flirty and naughty texts exchanged with a stranger. It also allows him to feel that he's getting to know this woman first and not be distracted by the exterior. For her part, this is exactly what Lexi also wants. She wants to be anonymous, to have a little fun with a hot stranger, all without risking involvement. But you know how that's going to work out! These two are damaged, or jaded, in their own ways, and you know they are perfect for each other. There is a bit of going back and forth, letting doubt creep in and sabotage a good thing. Is Jax's image bad for Lexi's career? Does Lexi want something from Jax, to use him? That sort of thing. And in the end, it's all about taking a risk and letting go; being a little reckless and seeing what happens. I kind of wanted a little more at the ending, which to me felt just a bit rushed. I think sometimes authors maybe underestimate the appeal of an epilogue, and I'm definitely one of those readers who likes an extra kiss there at the end. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this romance and this author, a lot. Loved the hero! Thought Jax was so sweet and fine, rough-edged but vulnerable. The romance is sweet, and the sex scenes are hot, erotic and detailed. This couple sparked the page, and it was arousing to read. I liked the secondary characters, too, all interesting and adding to the story, with Rubi being a true scene-stealer, and I can't wait for her story. RECKLESS is an easy and fun read, a good start to a sexy new series. Hot, sweet and romantic, it hit the spot tonight.", "id": 10129}

{"review": "What happens when Hollywood's bad boy in hiding meets little miss prim and proper? Hotness. Hotness happens. Lots-and-lots of hotness. Reckless is the first book in Skye Jordan's Renegades series and was unputdownable. Be warned, you will not want to put aside Jax and Lexie's story for anything. I had things to do yesterday, most of which did not get done simply because \"one more chapter\" turned into another, which turned into another, and so on. Not only was Reckless a smokin' hot read, but both Lexie and Jax were very engaging characters with issues they needed to overcome to make their relationship work. Jax (who happened to give me a major case of the swoons) is an actor turned stunt man who has been screwed over one too many times. He has trust issues out the yin yang and certainly isn't looking for more than a roll in the hay. Did I mention Jax is beyond smexy and quite the dirty talker? \"We've got all night to explore the many different kinds of orgasms that exist. And no, baby, they're not all the same.\" Lexie is a haute couture dress designer who hasn't had a vacation day in years. On her flight to the biggest business meeting of her life, she sees Jax. He's everything she wants but nothing she needs. She can't stop thinking about him so using a bad ass app her friend, Rubie, designed, she contacts him anonymously.

{"review": "What happens when Hollywood's bad boy in hiding meets little miss prim and proper? Hotness. Hotness happens. Lots-and-lots of hotness. Reckless is the first book in Skye Jordan's Renegades series and was unputdownable. Be warned, you will not want to put aside Jax and Lexie's story for anything. I had things to do yesterday, most of which did not get done simply because \"one more chapter\" turned into another, which turned into another, and so on. Not only was Reckless a smokin' hot read, but both Lexie and Jax were very engaging characters with issues they needed to overcome to make their relationship work. Jax (who happened to give me a major case of the swoons) is an actor turned stunt man who has been screwed over one too many times. He has trust issues out the yin yang and certainly isn't looking for more than a roll in the hay.

And no, baby, they're not all the same.\" Lexie is a haute couture dress designer who hasn't had a vacation day in years. On her flight to the biggest business meeting of her life, she sees Jax. He's everything she wants but nothing she needs. She can't stop thinking about him so using a bad ass app her friend, Rubie, designed, she contacts him anonymously.

Lexi LaCroix controls every aspect of her life - from her painstakingly detailed wedding gown designs to her love life. She's pulled herself from the dirt poor place she grew up in to one of the most sought after wedding apparel designers in the country. Now, more than ever, she must be careful about her actions. She's under intense scrutiny due to a possible lucrative partnership with Martina Galliano - the woman who can make all of Lexi's dreams come true. Unfortunately, the stress and pressure has finally gotten to Lexi. As owner and designer, she often puts in 14+ hour days stitching and mending her designs by hand. With the gain in notoriety, her drive to be the best and attain her dreams has burned her out. Now, with the most important deal of her life in the works, she's running out of designs...and inspiration. Jax Chamberlain. --Hang on, let me say it again. Jax Chamberlain.-- Former actor turned stuntman, Jax is used to women using him to get what they want. An audition, an introduction, an investment. He's been burned too many times and is quite simply done with sex-on-heels women who use him for connections to the entertainment industry. When Lexi sees Jax while leaving L.A. for New York - and is presented with an app that allows her to see the phone numbers of those around her - she does something reckless and anonymously texts him. The texts turn quickly from curious to flirtatious to smoldering. LEXI: What kind of sex do you like? JAX: I like the fiery, fast sex so passionate your vision blurs. JAX: I like wild, frantic, have-to-have-you sex that burns you alive. JAX: I like deep, driving sex where sweat drips off my chin, rolls down your spine, and tickles the dip between your *** cheeks. JAX: I like secret sex in naughty places, and naughty places to have secret sex. JAX: I like the kind of sex that includes sliding my tongue into all your very tight spaces. JAX: I like any kind of sex that drives animalistic sounds from your throat. Lexi must decide if she's willing to put her job on the line for what promises to be the wildest, most daring fling of her life. A one night affair does little to dim the attraction between them. Is Jax willing to let go and trust a woman who may just be using him? Can Lexi take a chance on a Hollyword bad boy? Whooo, boy Reckless took me completely off guard. I was not expecting anything extraordinary, I'd never read anything by the author before so I was shocked to find how much I enjoyed Reckless. Skye Jordan is obviously a talented writer and has earned her place as one of my go-to authors. Most engaging about the story, if we're going to get down and dirty, is the sex. I had to read this book twice because it was that good. Jax brought everything a man is supposed to bring to the table. He stripped Lexi of her control and in return allowed her to take back control of her career. He was sweet, passionate, and was the perfect dirty talker. *sah-woon* Then he eased the need by pushing his hand low. She gasped in surprise and excitement. At the feel of having a man's hand between her legs. A real man. The kind of man who made her hot and wet and needy. The kind of man who wasn't afraid to take charge or give real pleasure. When they meet again, both begin to drop their guards. Their connection and attraction is too strong to deny. Jax fears that his reputations will damage Lexi's chances at securing the partnership, so even though he's grown to care for her, he tries to let her go. --I loved him in this moment. He doesn't want her to suffer at the hands of the paparazzi and the vicious rumor mill, so he let her go. I loved his point of view. I don't know what it is about being inside a man's head, but it always makes a novel so great to me. Perhaps because I am able to understand their motivations and actions so much more. Either way, Jordan did a great job at writing Jax. I'm still salivating. I'm also excited to learn that this is a series.

He stripped Lexi of her control and in return allowed her to take back control of her career. He was sweet, passionate, and was the perfect dirty talker. *sah-woon* Then he eased the need by pushing his hand low. She gasped in surprise and excitement. At the feel of having a man's hand between her legs. A real man. The kind of man who made her hot and wet and needy. The kind of man who wasn't afraid to take charge or give real pleasure. When they meet again, both begin to drop their guards. Their connection and attraction is too strong to deny. Jax fears that his reputations will damage Lexi's chances at securing the partnership, so even though he's grown to care for her, he tries to let her go. --I loved him in this moment. He doesn't want her to suffer at the hands of the paparazzi and the vicious rumor mill, so he let her go. I loved his point of view. I don't know what it is about being inside a man's head, but it always makes a novel so great to me. Perhaps because I am able to understand their motivations and actions so much more. Either way, Jordan did a great job at writing Jax. I'm still salivating. I'm also excited to learn that this is a series. I can guarantee, based on the description, that the next book will be just as spectacularly crafted as the first. More devil-may-care bad*** men who know how to take care of their women - in more ways than one. I cannot wait to see what's next.", "id": 6487842011}

It seems to me that the author had one goal - sales from writing mommy porn. All that was needed was a few tears from a \"sweet\" heroine and plenty of graphic sex and voila! - lots of 5 star ratings! Give me a break and give me a story line that works, while you're at it!

{"review": "3.5 stars So let us just say that the book was just okay. We loved Jax Chamberlin and just thought that Skye Jordan could have done so much more with his character than Lexi. Jax Chamberlin, ex-actor, undercover wealthy, now movie stunt man is HOT and possibly every woman's dream. But he has been used by the best of them...wanting a role in a movie, to be introduced to the next big star, or just a little cash to tide them over. Jax is tired of being used and he is avoiding women all together. Meanwhile, Lexi is trying to find her way in the fashion world. She is making killer couture dresses for a hefty price, but she is ready to take her career to the next level. Taking her career to the next level could mean no time for fun and definitely no time for a man like Jax Chamberlin. Truthfully, Lexi thinks that Jax's image is all wrong for her career. And that pissed us off that she would judge him by his appearance and job description. Snob much Lexi!!! Well the story does have its good moments - you know Lexi caves in to Jax's sex appeal. And we loved the way he turned her out. Go Jax - Go Jax - Go Jax! 'He groaned, his hands moving over her like he couldn't touch her fast enough. His mouth eating at her mouth like he couldn't get enough of her taste. He pressed her against a wall, but she couldn't remember moving from the middle of the living room. His hips sank deep between her legs, and a fierce shot of pleasure arched her back. She broke the kiss on a moan.' Bayyybeee can you say Jax was putting it on her. So what didn't we like about it...well it may have been a little too much talk about the fashion world. Like really we didn't care about fabric or her making dresses...and we didn't need it to understand the chemistry between her and Jax. And a lot of scenes with Lexi made the story kind of boring. But Lexi had a kick a%& best friend, Rubi. Why is it that the best friend is always the carefree, fun person? It is settled we only want to be the sideline best friend and not the spotlight. LOL! Hell it was Rubi's great invention that got Lexi and Jax together in the first place. We will say that Lexi redeemed herself at the end...what she planned at her fashion show was so very sweet! But we are not even going to give you a hint...you have to read the book!", "id": 10129}

{"review": "I'm not always in the mood for romances, but when I am, I'm very picky. I want them to make sense, I want the characters to be likeable and believable, I want a story I can sink my teeth into, and above all, I want (of course) a happy ending. When I first picked up \"A Soft Place to Fall,\" it did not hold my interest. Try as I might, I could not get past the first chapter. But something kept me from putting it away permanently, and a few days ago, I was drawn to it again. This time, I was hooked. I'm not sure what put me off the first time, but this time around, I loved the story, the characters, the writing--everything. Basically, the plot revolves around two lost souls. Annie Galloway, everybody's vision of a perfect bride, and a perfect wife in a perfect marriage, has lost her perfect husband when she is only in her 30s. Only she knows the truth behind the facade of her seemingly fairy-tale life, and she cannot reveal it to anybody. Her grieving mother-in-law, Claudia, looks to her as a remnant of her lost son. Her friends and family continue the myth. So Annie finds herself a cottage in her home town of Shelter Rock Cove, Maine, and tries to pick up the pieces of her ruined life. All of her dreams, of happiness, of motherhood, of everything--seem gone forever. She is a shell, but a strong shell, if that makes any sense. Close by lives newly arrived Sam Butler, back home after a high-flying career in New York. Only he knows the terrible secret that haunts him and threatens his peace and security. He is in no better shape emotionally than Annie. Sam and Annie meet, and, in the way of most romance novels, sparks fly. But this book is written with intelligence and dignity. They do not eye one another and then jump into bed. A great deal of hurt is contained in each of these people, and as in real life, each is afraid to reveal that hurt or to risk another one. When they finally do fall in love, they do not live happily ever after. Reality intrudes. Big-time. How they solve their very real and very overwhelming problems while trying to save their budding relationship is the core of this wonderful story. I loved every word of it. And yes (sigh), it does have a happy ending.", "id": 17}

However, Kevin's mother Claudia refuses to allow Annie to move on feeling that would be an affront to the memory of her cherished son. She believes Sam cheated Annie with their real estate deal and is still interfering with her former daughter-in-law. As Sam and Annie begin to fall in love, Claudia is like a ghost from the past reminding Annie that Kevin was forever. Barbara Bretton has written a powerful relationship drama loaded with angst and emotion as the past and the future clash within Annie with the catalyst being the key secondary characters causing the skirmishes that tear at her gut. The story line provides the audience with a poignant character study as readers travel deep into the souls of the lead couple and the support cast. Anyone who enjoys a passionate look inside the hearts and souls of the prime players will find A SOFT PLACE TO FALL a solid book to read. Harriet Klausner", "id": 158568011}
{"review": "Sam Butler and Annie Galloway were playing the cards they were dealt. Each of them loses both of their parents at a very young age. Each of them is so bound by family responsibility that they overlook one very important thing--their own happiness. This is a love story that is dying to be told. It is a love story that is destined to happen. And although the plot is fairly predictable at the climax, the reader cannot possibly stop reading to find out if these two wonderful, loving people can outrun their pasts and actually find their own happiness. It is a beautifully written romance. Hearts will thump during the romantic encounters. Tears will flow at the end. Then the urge to reread will immediately begin.

{"review": "This is the 2nd book I have read by this author. I liked the first one so much (At Last) I wanted to read another. Again the author delivered a nice romantic novel although this has a bit more in the way of explicit sex scenes which turns me off in a romance novel...the plot was not as good as At Last in my opinion. The characters come alive on the page. I liked the fact that the characters were a bit complex and you got to understand them, a little at a time, through the circumstances they go through. What the book does lack is depth to the story. With some attention to detail, this author could be a well known romance writer, instead of one who appears to be churning out books without taking the time to make sure the book is really ready to go to print. What was a disappointment with this book as well as the last book I read was editing issues. Typos...at least 13 of them (At Last was even worse for typos). These books were published quite some time ago, the author has had plenty of time to correct typos in them...but apparently doesn't care that her work is not flawless as more well known authors books are. That is what separates \"the men from the boys\" and separates great writers from mediocre ones. Writers need to take enough pride in their books to make sure they are published without glaring errors (and the errors I found were glaring, not just misplaced punctuation marks, which I did not keep track of but were also there). I had never heard of this author before her free offering of \"At Last\"...but with books that are consistently flawed, I can understand why. Books that lack good editing have \"amateur\" written all over them... I liked the book, although it was a pretty typical romance, which can sometimes get boring...how many different ways can you tell the story of \"boy meets girl, there are issues to overcome, but they get beyond it and live happily ever after...\" The book was OK...nothing special about the plot, but a nice read for a change of pace from some of the other genres I read. I certainly could not read book after book like this, it would get too boring.", "id": 17}

In the end, there wasn't much of a conclusion for the problems in Sam's background. This was just another thing that was glossed over.

{"review": "R.P. Dahlke grew up living the crop-dusting life in Modesto, California in the San Joaquin Valley. Her father owned and operated his own Aero Ag business for over thirty years. Today, her son has taken up the torch and flies crop-dusters in the same area. Dahlke is glad to write about it ... but not live it. She currently lives in Tucson, Arizona where she writes her very popular novels. She is a member of Sisters in Crime (the first president of the Cochise County chapter as well as the National chapter), Mystery Writers of America, The Society of Southwestern Authors, and the first president of the Cochise County Chapter of Sisters in Crime. She has six books to her credit, of which this is the fourth in the series of the Dead Red Mysteries. And so we meet up with our favorite heroine Lalla Bains, tall, blond and beautiful ex-model turned crop-duster from Modesto, California all the way in Wishbone, Arizona: `I wasn't supposed to be in Wishbone, Arizona, fearfully scouring the desert for my missing father. I was supposed to be on my honeymoon, married at last to my sweetie, Sheriff Caleb Stone.' That is the manner in which Dahlke has mastered the mystery genre - twists and turns with a huge dollop of humor and fun despite the evil derring-do of her encountered characters. Lalla finds her father in a mine pit atop a corpse who happens to be the local police chief. And as always with Dahlke's stories other coincidental deaths occur - this time a young woman artist - and Lalla is convinced the two murders are connected. The altar deserting Caleb arrives (much to Lalla's consternation) and ends up assisting Lalla in the investigation of the two murders. This is enough of a synopsis to lead any reader (especially if already a RP Dahlke fan) to grab this speedy read and escape reality for Dahlke's far more preposterous and entertaining world. Dahlke is a polished storyteller, having that innate sense of the need for humor inserted into her mysteries that helps not only propel them along, but also keeps our attention during the rest stops. And while producing suspense about a very complicated crime she lets her story breathe with relationships - family, friends, loves - that allows us to build faith in the somewhat quirky character of Lalla Bains, a trait that practically guarantees that readers will follow the other books in this Dead Red Mysteries series. This is a very strong, immensely satisfying, idiosyncratic and entertaining mystery novel. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 14", "id": 4465}

This is enough of a synopsis to lead any reader (especially if already a RP Dahlke fan) to grab this speedy read and escape reality for Dahlke's far more preposterous and entertaining world. Dahlke is a polished storyteller, having that innate sense of the need for humor inserted into her mysteries that helps not only propel them along, but also keeps our attention during the rest stops. And while producing suspense about a very complicated crime she lets her story breathe with relationships - family, friends, loves - that allows us to build faith in the somewhat quirky character of Lalla Bains, a trait that practically guarantees that readers will follow the other books in this Dead Red Mysteries series. This is a very strong, immensely satisfying, idiosyncratic and entertaining mystery novel. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, September 14", "id": 157317011}
{"review": "Did you know snakes hate mothballs? That's not the only bit of information I gleaned from Rebecca Dahlke's latest novel A Dead Red Alibi. I haven't read any of her other books, but immediately took a liking to her tough as nails heroine, Lalla. The long term patrons of Roxanne's Truck Café have had a couple of pools going on whether and when Lalla would wed her long term partner in crime Sheriff Caleb Stone, as she is wedlock shy, having tried it many times. Finally naming the day, when the prospective bridegroom is an hour and a half late, his bride has fled,. Opting out of Modesto California as her Dad has sold the Aero-Ag business and intends raising milking goats, (and I can't say I blame her)our heroine lights out of Modesto California to a property in Arizona with an outside latrine and coyotes. A wedding present from Auntie Mae. You have to wonder whether she has Lalla's best interests at heart. Dad falls down a mine shaft where he is keeping company with a corpse, who turns out to be the Sheriff of Wishbone, where they now reside. Suffice to say our gal has a talent for solving crimes. Nothing daunted, Caleb turns up and the hunt for a killer is on. This is the beginning of the story, so you can see you're in for an Abu Dahbi Desert Challenge car rally read. And you get it as they uncover a drug trafficking ring. I'm not one for spoiling a reader's enjoyment of a book by detailing the story. The author produces another cracking good yarn for her fans. Buy a copy, hold on to your hats and thoroughly enjoy yourself.", "id": 4465}

{"review": "Wouldn’t you know that a botched wedding would result in everyone moving to the Arizona desert? In the case of the fourth book in the series, Lalla Bains, stood up at the altar by Sheriff Caleb Stone, runs to inherited property in southeastern Arizona. When her father falls into an abandoned mine, on top of another lawman who happens to be dead, the story is off and running with a lot of unexpected turns and an unhealthy number of suspects. The characters are bright and lively and somewhat unpredictable. Occasionally, Lalla and her sidekick Cousin Pearlie, seem to stumble into clues rather than ferreting them out. It’s good fun and a clever plot that keeps the reader guessing until the very end. Highly recommended.", "id": 4465}

{"review": "Dead Red Alibi presents proof that Lalla and her family do not cause murder and mayhem, it follows them around. On a trip to Arizona, Lalla’s dad stumbles into trouble, literally when he falls into a mine shaft occupied by a recently dead body, the local sheriff. Lalla and her cousin, the Lady Smith packing Pearlie take on the challenge of finding the killers in their usual outrageous style. The new location, Wishbone aka Bisbee in Southern Arizona presents interesting scenery and options for characters. The story is fast paced and well written to present multiple options to keep the readers guessing “who done it”. I especially liked that Lalla’s sweetie, Caleb’s personality is showcased more in this book. I look forward to more adventures of Lalla’s gang in the southwest.", "id": 4465}

{"review": "From the first sentence of this fourth installment of the Dead Red series, author R.P. Dahlke had me hooked. “Except for a lank rope and ancient boards loosely sheltering a dark hole, my dad's brand new four-wheel-drive Jeep sat coolly detached and totally unconcerned that its driver was nowhere around.” Of course I wanted to know just what might be in that hole and how this unfortunate soul came to be there. As with all R.P. Dahlke mysteries, she begins by throwing out an enticing rope. Not once have I been able to refuse grabbing onto it, and I’ve been rewarded with a fantastic ride each and every time. There is something most intriguing about a well written series, and R.P. Dahlke has created just that. With her debut novel, A Dead Red Cadillac, she introduced a host of characters that held tremendous appeal. In each novel since, the main players have grown increasingly more captivating. The ones who have been added or subtracted, (this is a mystery series after all and not everyone makes it,) have been many things. They’ve been deceitful, playful, funny, evil, intelligent, dim-witted and crafty, but never have they been boring. You never know what kind of character you may be introduced to in a R.P. Dahlke novel, but you can be darn sure that whoever shows up will be successful in keeping you well entertained. A Dead Red Alibi is my favorite of the series so far. The mystery is a solid one. There were a few times I thought I had it figured out, but Dahlke’s a pro. She’s gifted when it comes to weaving an exciting tale and knows well how to leave crumbs for her readers to follow. She’s clever with her clues and even better with her ability to surprise. This was a fun read with an enormously satisfying ending that will have you shaking your head, laughing out loud and wondering why all books don’t wrap up so creatively. I hope this author is busy right now at her computer. I can’t wait for book number five.", "id": 4465}

You can't go wrong with the Dead Red series of books!", "id": 157317011}
{"review": "I wondered how the crew of Lalla, Caleb, Pearlie and Lalla's dad, Noah, would fare in their transition from California to the Arizona desert. They pulled it off without a hitch -- other than the usual murders, of course. Dahlke makes the desert environment come alive. Her characters don't just have a dry day, it's a dust-in-your mouth kind of day. The potential list of suspects is a good one, and the killer and his motives are a surprise. I highly recommend \"A Dead Read Alibi.\"", "id": 4465}

{"review": "I thoroughly enjoyed Playing with Poison. What a wonderful debut! Jessie Hewitt, protagonist, historical romance writer, and pool shark, is a delight. She is funny, smart and very loyal to her friends. Jessie is in the middle of working on her latest book when she answers a knock on her door. Her neighbor's fiancé, Stanley, stumbles in, collapses on her couch, and dies. So begins a really fun read. Naturally, Jessie immediately becomes a `person of interest' so she feels compelled to investigate. Eventually, Candy (friendly neighbor, lingerie seller, and Stanley's fiancée), is arrested for the murder. Jessie is convinced she is innocent and sets out to prove it. Ms. Blackburn has written a very engaging story. She has filled her book with a great group of characters. Since most of these characters have a good reason for wanting Stanley dead, it isn't easy to figure out the identity of the culprit. I was hooked before I finished reading the first page--actually, it was the first sentence that pulled me in. Being of a certain age, or as Candy puts it, old, that sentence had me nodding my head and chuckling. Throughout the book, Jessie gives us a sneak peek into her work-in-progress, which enhanced the story and made me laugh. This is a well-written story with humor, believable dialogue, extremely likeable characters, and just the right amount of romance--everything I love in a story! I've just downloaded the next two books in this series: Double Shot and Three Odd Balls. Looking forward to reading them. Can't wait to see what Ms. Blackburn has in store for Jessie and her friends. Happy reading!", "id": 4465}

{"review": "This is a light, cozy mystery written in a breezy manner. The murder plot is nicely set up, and the suspects are all credibly drawn. Jessie Hewitt is an engaging amateur sleuth; and the relationship between Captain Wilson Rye is nicely developed and this reader wants them to end up together as a couple and looks forward to further development of their relationship in future Cue Ball Mysteries. I love Jessie's clever, sarcastic repartee with Wilson and anyone else she chooses to dish it out to! The town of Clarence has a cozy feel to it as does The Stone Fountain, and sounds like a place I would like to retire. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the bar room pool games and Jessie's `real job' writer's block trials and tribulations of the Harlequin romance-like heroine, Alexis Wynsome and her knight in shining armor, Rolfe Vanderhorn. These passages are written with such exaggerated verbiage that I could almost hear Jessie laughing to herself that her loyal following is so hinged on reading her next book. A fun `chick-lit' book in that Jessie is someone to whom many women `of a certain age' can relate - a menopausal divorcee, generally content with her life/livelihood, surrounded by good friends whose collective quirkiness constitute a family, yet someone who still believes in love, Prince Charming and the living happily ever after fairytale ending.", "id": 4465}

It starts with a neighbor's boyfriend falling dead on a the principal character's couch. Without due process or a coroner's report, by page five the lead detective has declared it to be murder by poison and then harasses everyone from the main character (a successful writer of all things) to all of the writer's friends and acquaintances. Everybody's upset, but not so upset that they can't go have dinner and drinks, feeling mildly harassed but not uncomfortable. By the second chapter, all the suspects and are sitting around complaining what an ogre the lead detective is. There's so much dialogue and so little thought that I struggled to go on for three more chapters. It will make a very successful bad TV series, \"CSI Des Moines\" (with apologies to Des Moines).

{"review": "This was such a fun cozy mystery! Jessie Hewitt, steamy romance author and pool player extraordinaire, was an enjoyable character who made me laugh. She is accused of murdering her neighbor's boyfriend when he stumbles into her apartment and promptly dies on the couch. Jessie is perplexed and flat-out annoyed when Detective Wilson Rye informs her she's the prime suspect. It is wonderful to see the tension build between them, and you can just tell they drive each other crazy...in bad ways and in good. Jessie sets out to clear her name by finding out who the real killer is, and why, even though she's been told she does not need to be sleuthing around. Jessie's sleuthing is balanced with her writing her latest romance novel. It's interesting to see that little story developing within the story as well. Detective Wilson Rye tells Jessie at one point that he is 90% sure she is innocent, and that gets her fired up. :) She is investigating all their friends, her ex-husband, the company the deceased worked for, and more. I wasn't sure if I would like a book that involved pool-playing, but I really did like it. I thought the story would be a lot more focused on the game of pool, and it wasn't.

{"review": "I think this is a really good album. I wasn't all that impressed on first hearing, but I have been playing it a lot (I had the good fortune to receive an advance copy) and it has grown on me hugely. It is a pleasure to listen to and there is real musical quality here. Plant these days is much more in Raising Sand mode rather than full-on Zeppelin blazing. He is subtle and controlled (although there is still plenty of power there when needed) and I think this makes him a very fine singer indeed. He brings genuine depth to this material which is pleasingly varied, with elements of blues, Celtic music, rock, Bluegrass, gospel and various African styles all evident. It is quite rhythm-driven with percussion shaping almost every song, but it's varied and very well done so never becomes tedious or samey. The Sensational Shape Shifters are simply brilliant, playing their variety of instruments with real virtuosity. They complement and incorporate Plant's vocals beautifully, helped by impeccable production which to me makes this album shine with beauty, excitement and interest throughout. Rainbow and A Stolen Kiss, for example, are simply lovely in their own ways while Up On the Hollow Hill is modal, rhythmic and hypnotically involving. I don't think there's a duff track on the album and some are quite wonderful.

I wasn't all that impressed on first hearing, but I have been playing it a lot (I had the good fortune to receive an advance copy) and it has grown on me hugely. It is a pleasure to listen to and there is real musical quality here. Plant these days is much more in Raising Sand mode rather than full-on Zeppelin blazing. He is subtle and controlled (although there is still plenty of power there when needed) and I think this makes him a very fine singer indeed. He brings genuine depth to this material which is pleasingly varied, with elements of blues, Celtic music, rock, Bluegrass, gospel and various African styles all evident. It is quite rhythm-driven with percussion shaping almost every song, but it's varied and very well done so never becomes tedious or samey. The Sensational Shape Shifters are simply brilliant, playing their variety of instruments with real virtuosity. They complement and incorporate Plant's vocals beautifully, helped by impeccable production which to me makes this album shine with beauty, excitement and interest throughout. Rainbow and A Stolen Kiss, for example, are simply lovely in their own ways while Up On the Hollow Hill is modal, rhythmic and hypnotically involving. I don't think there's a duff track on the album and some are quite wonderful.

{"review": "Mention Robert Plant's name to most people and they immediately think of the golden haired, probably shirtless, wailing singer fronting Led Zeppelin. These days, though, that's years in the past. Plant still has the raw vocal power that he used to such effect is his time with Zeppelin, but he's obviously grown and matured and is comfortable in his own skin these days, and that's a very good thing for those who enjoy solid music. Plant's music has always been obviously influenced very heavily by the blues of the American south, something that he himself freely admits. The magic of Zeppelin had a large part to do with combining that music with British rock sensibilities and imagery from his home country. The magic of \"lullaby and... The Ceaseless Roar\" has to do with combining southern blues with West African and other world music influences. Plant has spent a fair amount of time re-familiarizing himself with the music of America over the past few years - living in Austin, TX, recording the wonderful \"Raising Sand\" album with Alison Krauss, and digging into the roots of his original influences. For the recording of this album he returned to England and gathered his touring band, The Sensational Space Shifters, who include some longtime Plant collaborators (Cast guitarist Liam Tyson, Massive Attack keyboardist John Baggot) as well as Juldeh Camara, a west African Griot. The result is an album that manages to find solid footing combining the American blues with West African instrumentation and rhythms and occasional electronic sampling and loops. There are blues classics by the Stanley Brothers (Little Maggie) and Ledbelly (Poor Howard) reworked to fit right in with the originals. Plant had originally wanted to record \"Little Maggie\" for the Raising Sand album with Alison Krauss, but didn't feel he was able to get the feeling \"right\" for that album. I'm glad that he saved it, because it's the perfect opening track here. West African rhythmic patterns coupled with banjos and the edgy tension of Plant's voice provide the perfect way to set the feeling for the album. The rest of the tracks cover the spectrum from the uplifting \"Rainbow\" to the quiet ballad \"A Stolen Kiss\" to the romp of \"Embrace Another Fall\" (which contains a sample from the Afrocelt track \"Life Begin Again\" that Plant provided vocals for in 2001). While there are one or two tracks here that sound like they just might have been lifted from the Zeppelin back catalog (\"Turn It Up\" in particular) if you come to this album looking for Led Zeppelin you'll be disappointed. If you come to it looking for the work of a master who understands his musical influences and can move easily through their differing styles, you'll be very, very happy.", "id": 301668}

{"review": "I was never a big Led Zeppelin fan and I've never really kept in touch with Robert's post Zeppelin career but I really enjoyed his set on this year's Glastonbury, which I thought was very interesting in the way that it combined his blues and rock roots with folk and world music. His band (The Sensational Space Shifters) featuring guitarists Justin Adams and Liam `Skin' Tyson and long-time associate John Baggot on keyboards are also very adaptable and manage to meld all these different styles together into a pleasing mix that makes sense and sounds good. They are joined by Billy Fuller on bass and Dave Smith on drums, as well as the Gambian multi-instrumentalist Juldeh Camara to add a bit of third world authenticity. \"Little Maggie\" and \"Rainbow\" from the Glastonbury set and both released as singles get us off to a great start, \"Little Maggie\" mixing country, blues and African music and \"Rainbow\" sounding like Bo Diddley meets U2. I really liked the reworking of the old Leadbelly song \"Poor Howard\", which sounds like it could have been a Zeppelin acoustic workout. It's not just recycled roots though, there is lots of originality and variety here from the beautiful haunting piano-based ballad \"A stolen kiss\" (which contains the album's title in its lyrics), to the more folky \"Embrace Another Fall\" where he shares the vocals with Julie Murphy and the quite poppy, much lighter \"House of love\" and \"Somebody there\", the latter with its great sounding guitars. Although Robert's distinctive voice is at the centre of all the songs the band also play their part in making this an outstanding record, both their individual contributions and their wonderful ensemble playing. You've got to admire how Robert continues to juggle all his musical interests - rock, soul, blues, folk, country, ballads, electronica, African, Middle Eastern - and, rather than concentrating on just one, manages to combine them all and still take his music forward rather than wallowing in his past.", "id": 301668}

{"review": "Obviously you are reading this because you like Robert Plant. If you are deciding if this work is worthy of purchase, I say yes. I'm a fan of every album he's made since he left Led Zeppelin. And I'm a fan of Led Zeppelin of course. Robert Plant's solo music is not Led Zeppelin type of music. He has been extremely adventurous post Zep. Some people don't get it. I'm open to what he does because hey, who am I to say what direction he should pursue? I trust the guy because he is ROBERT PLANT. Go with him folks, you won't be disappointed. Put your headphones on and go to the magical place he created. He is one of the greatest musicians alive today. It would be a tragedy if people only realize this once he's gone. Immerse yourself in his music, it's not hard to become one with it. I received this new album and U2's album on the same day. Although U2's work is incredibly fantastic, Robert still holds his own. Get both works by these veterans of rock who are able to bring a peace, meaning and worthiness to our lives.

I trust the guy because he is ROBERT PLANT. Go with him folks, you won't be disappointed. Put your headphones on and go to the magical place he created.

{"review": "There's no doubting that Guardians of the Galaxy is the first truly fun movie you'll see all summer. In a summer where the truly fantastic movies' themes have been the daddy issues and nuclear nightmares of gigantic radioactive dinosaurs, and xenophobia in an planet where humans and apes struggle to coexist, halfway through the summer comes the first film that has been the total escape of the year. Sure, it isn't a perfect movie- there are some issues with pacing, and the villains' dialogue is a tad corny, and some underdeveloped character relationships, but none of that matters when you're having so much fun and reveling in the action, clever dialogue, amazing visuals and in general, the nostalgia that the themes conjure up such as elements of Star Wars, Indiana Jones and even The Avengers. But one thing that is perfect? Its soundtrack. I say without exaggeration that you will walk out with several of its 1970s retro gold tracks in your head. And since I've picked up the soundtrack CD on Friday, I haven't been able to stop listening to it since- it's been on my iPad, my phone, on the way to work during dinner, etc. And I can say that one listen is enough to get this effect going. Mix tapes play a big part of the film's themes. The protagonist, Peter \"Starlord\" Quill, has a Walkman he keeps on him as he goes around and steals ancient artifacts from far-off planets- something he's had since he was a kid, and a tape deck on his spaceship. He has his \"Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" he has had since childhood, and its music, in addition to Tyler Bates' incidental music, is what makes up the heart of the film. And on its own, it's just as great, if maybe even better. The entire album is 12 1970s hits, some you can sing along to by heart, some you forgot even existed, and others you may have never even heard. And it works- the soundtrack isn't just nostalgia for nostalgia's sake. It's music that people of all walks of life will love- in fact, when's the last time you can say you've played tracks like \"Hooked on a Feeling\" or \"Come and Get Your Love\" at full blast? That's why the soundtrack works- it's an eclectic mix of classics that's suited for any occasion whatsoever. In a nice touch, the executive soundtrack producers (director James Gunn, Exec. producer Kevin Feige and Dave Jordan) have re-mastered the tracks in a way to make the tracks sound as if they're being played through an old tape deck, to keep the feel of the tracks. In addition, the track selection is nothing short of perfect. If this were any other film, tracks such as \"I Want You Back\" or \"O-o-h Child\" being on the soundtrack would come off as passé, but here, it makes perfect sense, given the film's themes and nostalgic feel. Starting off the tracklist on an energetic note with Blue Swede's cover of \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and ending with \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", the tracklist is consistent- a rollercoaster of high energy uptempo rockers (\"Cherry Bomb\", \"Spirit in the Sky\"), smooth ballads to even things out (\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\", \"I'm Not in Love\"), and funky pop classics (\"I Want You Back\", \"Come and Get My Love\"). Every track on the disc is perfectly placed, and not once does the energy come to a stop. In the context of the film, they work equally as fantastic- watching our heroes get ready for war to the sounds of \"Cherry Bomb\", watching Quill get down and boogie to \"Come and Get My Love\" over the opening credits, watching Quill fly his way back to his ship in his battle gear to the funky sounds of \"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)\". What's not to love? In short, this soundtrack is for everyone. The older crowd will love having a collection of hits to remind them of the good old days of the seventies, the younger crowd can use this to put themselves in their dad's shoes and remember what it was like to be a teenager and be groovin' to tunes like \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and \"Spirit in the Sky\". As of writing, this album is currently the highest selling soundtrack of the year, and it's hardly a surprise to me- both in the sense that it's just so freaking good, and in the sense that the day I bought it, I had to go to three stores just to get it. So, by all means, buy this album. Get out your red leather coat, protective helmet and hook your mini Jetpack to your shoes, rev up your spaceship, fly around and dance around in the vast deserts of interstellar planets to these songs. Go join a group of heroes that includes a bitter and cynical raccoon, a walking tree, an angsty alien and a green warrior woman. Play these songs just to annoy them. Whatever the case, this is an absolute must-buy.", "id": 37}

In addition, the track selection is nothing short of perfect. If this were any other film, tracks such as \"I Want You Back\" or \"O-o-h Child\" being on the soundtrack would come off as passé, but here, it makes perfect sense, given the film's themes and nostalgic feel. Starting off the tracklist on an energetic note with Blue Swede's cover of \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and ending with \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\", the tracklist is consistent- a rollercoaster of high energy uptempo rockers (\"Cherry Bomb\", \"Spirit in the Sky\"), smooth ballads to even things out (\"Fooled Around and Fell in Love\", \"I'm Not in Love\"), and funky pop classics (\"I Want You Back\", \"Come and Get My Love\"). Every track on the disc is perfectly placed, and not once does the energy come to a stop. In the context of the film, they work equally as fantastic- watching our heroes get ready for war to the sounds of \"Cherry Bomb\", watching Quill get down and boogie to \"Come and Get My Love\" over the opening credits, watching Quill fly his way back to his ship in his battle gear to the funky sounds of \"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)\". What's not to love? In short, this soundtrack is for everyone. The older crowd will love having a collection of hits to remind them of the good old days of the seventies, the younger crowd can use this to put themselves in their dad's shoes and remember what it was like to be a teenager and be groovin' to tunes like \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and \"Spirit in the Sky\". As of writing, this album is currently the highest selling soundtrack of the year, and it's hardly a surprise to me- both in the sense that it's just so freaking good, and in the sense that the day I bought it, I had to go to three stores just to get it. So, by all means, buy this album. Get out your red leather coat, protective helmet and hook your mini Jetpack to your shoes, rev up your spaceship, fly around and dance around in the vast deserts of interstellar planets to these songs. Go join a group of heroes that includes a bitter and cynical raccoon, a walking tree, an angsty alien and a green warrior woman. Play these songs just to annoy them. Whatever the case, this is an absolute must-buy.", "id": 1297809011}

{"review": "Ryan Adams is truly a great singer/songwriter. My biggest knock on some his earlier solo work has been that some of his albums have sounded largely the same end to end (example - 29). That's not the case with this album. Ryan Adams (the album) breathes more from song to song. Also, the focus on the electric guitar this time around with some acoustic songs mixed is music to my ears. So far, the standout songs for me are \"Gimme Something Good\", \"I Just Might\" and \"Am I Safe\". \"I Just Might\" has a Bruce Springsteen or Bob Mould feel. The latter comparison may be a reflection of how much I enjoyed Ryan's rendition of \"Black Sheets of Rain\" during the Bob Mould tribute concert. But, I digress. A really strong effort from Ryan Adams. Looking forward to catching him on tour. THANKS.", "id": 37}

{"review": "Wow. Ryan drops out of music for a bit and comes back with a VENGEANCE. This is his best work yet. From the opening notes on \"Gimme Something Good\" you feel you are going to get your mind blown. And you do. Repeatedly. This approach he took of \"hanging out with the boys\" and writing definitely worked. These songs are so well crafted and the lyrics so soul cutting...it takes many, many listens to get it all. Every song on this record is good. My favorite is \"Tired of Giving Up.\" It's simply the best rock song to come down the pipes in a long time. It's just perfect. The jangling guitar riff just \"murders you\" as Keith Richards would say. But there are so many magical moments... \"Trouble, I feel you watch me from across the room.\" \"Kim\" is heartbreaking. I never thought he would be able to write a \"song about a girl\" as sad as \"La Cienega Just Smiled\" but he did it. \"My Wrecking Ball\" is another major highlight. The imagery and longing in the song shows Ryan doing what he does best...and at the very top of his game. Get it. Kick back. And listen to it start to finish. In order. It will be one of the musical highlights of your year.", "id": 37}

{"review": "Ryan Adams has always worn his influences on his sleeve, but to his great credit he has never been a musician who just rips other artists off. His music references a ton of different styles and eras, yet always seems to be contemporary and original. This self-titled offering is rooted firmly in 80's AOR radio, with sleek rockers backed up against softer acoustic fare. The first single, \"Gimme Something Good\" has a nifty riff and a hooky chorus, and the album just gains momentum after that. And Adams, as always, brings his lyrical punch along for the ride. It's going to take a few more listens for me to decide just where this album will sit in the Ryan Adams discography. Truth is, it might take more than a few listens as I have often found new layers of depth in older albums. To me, that's the mark of a truly gifted artist. If you're a fan, you'll get this. If you're new to Ryan Adams, this isn't a bad place to start. It's true to the present and informed by the past, and that makes for a solid 5-star effort as far as I am concerned.", "id": 37}

Other moments remind me of, believe it or not, some of the stuff that the BoDeans have done. Overall, this album rocks. Even during the slower pieces you still feel the need to crank the volume up.

{"review": "I discovered Ryan Adams and this CD via Tal Wilkenfeld. Music that relies on vocals and songwriting is usually not my cup of tea; I am usually much more interested in instrumental music. But this is really compelling music. The songwriting is extremely strong: There is not a weak song on the whole CD. Adams' heart felt vocals fit perfectly. While the songwriting and vocals are the strength of the music, the instrumentation is excellent as well. Wilkenfeld, Tench, Stacey, and Adams play their instruments with admirable taste, soul, and restraint. The production values are very high as well. Of the CDs released this year I have heard, this overall might be the best -- of any genre. Impressive.", "id": 37}

{"review": "When I see that Ryan Adams is releasing a new lp, I order it! Boy am I glad I have that policy. Here we find Ryan Adams trying a different direction from \"Ashes & Fire\" (a beautiful lp), He has, it seems, a new outlook, which includes a more positive, upbeat and rockin' fare. \"Stay With Me\" has the Benmont Tench touch: IE: Tom Petty, sounds &%#@%&* awesome! He has some great people helping him out too, Benmont Tench . Oddly enough, there is a credit to Johnny Depp who plays guitar on \"Kim\". Who knew. Ryan, for me, always impresses. I'm glad he's stretching out here for a new sound. I love it! This mini review didn't really say much, just give it a listen, it will speak for itself. Sometimes less is more! This is, IMO, his best solo lp ever! Artist 5 stars Content 5 stars Sonics 4.5 stars Mandy has got to be a great source of love and inspiration!", "id": 37}

{"review": "Exactly one year after J.J. Cale died (he passed away in July 2013, at the age of 74), this tribute by some of the world's greatest guitarists appears, headed by Eric Clapton. Cale was one of the founders of the so-called Tulsa Sound, a swampy mix of blues, country and rock 'n' roll. The relaxed guitar sounds of J.J. Cale had a great influence on many guitarists, including Eric Clapton, so it's not strange that from his hands a tribute to J.J. Cale comes forth. It's not only that Clapton earlier recorded work from the bluesman, take for example such hits as \"Cocaine\" and \"After Midnight,\" but the two also worked together regularly. Shortly before his death, Cale could be heard on Clapton's 2013 album \"Old Sock\" and in 2006 they won a Grammy for their album \"The Road To Escondido.\" On \"The Breeze: An Appreciation Of JJ Cale,\" Clapton enlists the help of string virtuosos like Tom Petty, John Mayer, Mark Knopfler, and Don White. Willie Nelson sings along, as does Cale's wife Christine Lakeland, who provides backing vocals on \"Crying Eyes.\" Everyone's singing and guitar style compliments the 16 compositions on this album impressively. Thus Mayer's rhythmic game works wonderfully on \"Don't Wait,\" while his drawling vocals prove very suitable for the slightly country-fried version of \"Magnolia.\" Knopfler infuses \"Someday\" with his signature guitar work and Nelson's fragile vocals enrich \"Songbird\" and \"Starbound,\" although his somewhat nasal twang might not be to everyone's liking. Clapton is in great form himself on the funky \"Cajun Moon.\" The biggest surprise comes in the form of the wonderful harmonies between Clapton and Petty on songs like \"Rock And Roll Records,\" \"The Old Man And Me\" and \"I Got The Same Old Blues.\" That these men are kings of the six-string and give their guitars a good workout, they've made abundantly clear by the end of the record. Incidentally, the record is named after Cale's single \"Call Me The Breeze\" from 1972. But in his four-decade career, Cale recorded 15 albums and was an inspiration to a generation of artists like Clapton, so I only hope Clapton & Friends will do a follow-up to this album, which is a very worthy tribute to J.J. Cale's legacy indeed. Tracks 1, 7 & 16 are from J.J. Cale's 1972 album \"Naturally.\" Tracks 2, 6, 8, 11, 12 & 14 are from his 1974 album \"Okie.\" Track 4 is from his 1973 album \"Really.\" Track 5 is from his 1979 album \"5.\" Track 10 is from his 2007 album \"Rewind: The Unreleased Recordings.\" Track 15 is from his 1982 album \"Grasshopper.\" Track 3 \"Someday,\" track 9 \"Songbird\" and track 13 \"Train To Nowhere\" are previously unreleased Cale songs.", "id": 301668}

{"review": "Over the last few years tributes have become quite common in the Roots music world. Howlin' Wolf, Jimmy Reed, Little Walter and Son House have all been honored recently with a salute to Muddy Waters due for release in August. These tributes generally fall into two categories: the artist who was influenced by someone past and never got the chance to perform with (Maria Muldaur's take on Memphis Minnie; Rory Block's \"The Lady and Mr. Johnson\") or a musician will honor someone they played with who helped to develop their style (John Mooney's recent salute to his mentor Son House; David Newman's tribute to Ray Charles \"I Remember Brother Ray\"). Eric Clapton's tribute to his friend and favorite songwriter, the late JJ Cale falls into the latter category and is aptly titled- this is truly an APPRECIATION. Clapton was first motivated for this project during the flight from England to attend Cale's funeral July of 2013. He met Don White at the funeral; White was one of the first band leaders to ever hire Cale. When White agreed to the tribute, Clapton moved ahead and hired bassist Nathan East and drummer Jim Keltner for the rhythm section (Keltner, one of the greatest drummers in history is an Okie like Cale contributing to the famous Tulsa sound). Clapton's choice of guests on this project speaks to his strength as a band leader. Mark Knopfler, John Mayer, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty and Don White are all gifted, all very different performers yet the common thread of creating a groove unites them in this very successful undertaking. Cale was quoted in a Blues Review interview ten years ago \"They needed a marketing term for me, so they picked two- \"laid-back\" and \"recluse\". True enough. But Cale's contribution of the quiet groove should be remembered as much as the \"marketing terms\". Clapton plays on all sixteen tracks, and the songs where he is featured work the best. His phrasing is so similar to Cale's you could swear they were in the booth together, just like their 2006 collaboration \"The Road To Escondido\". Clapton long ago realized he had nothing left to prove as a virtuoso, so he allows the songs to breathe, where groove and nuance are more important than flash. Mark Knopfler is a kindred spirit, and his featured cuts \"Someday\" and \"Train to Nowhere\" would make JJ proud. On \"Train\", Clapton and White trade lead vocal verses with Knopfler and the two guitar phenoms engage in a bit of call and response, but in a low-key manner- no one-upmanship needed here. Tom Petty duets with Clapton on \"I Got The Same Old Blues\", but his true shining moment is \"The Old Man and Me\". Petty sings this track from the album \"Okie\" in a low, hushed whisper. You have to really lean in and listen, which I'm sure is the point (one on-line reviewer says Petty \"really steals the show\" with this performance. This Florida native son has the Tulsa/Red Dirt thing down cold. Fellow Okies contribute to several tracks. Drummer Jamie Oldaker has played with Clapton on and off over the years, beginning with 1974's \"461 Ocean Boulevard\". Harmonica great Jimmie Markham (better known as Junior Markham) adds tasty diatonic harp to \"Train\". Markham is considered to be one of the caretakers of the Tulsa sound, and Clapton made a wise decision to bring him on board. The album's closer. \"Crying Eyes\" is the strongest track on this well sequenced disc Clapton duets with Christine Lakeland, Cale's widow and a fine singer/guitarist in her own right. Derek Trucks' is a highlight here and on the Willie Nelson vehicle \"Starbound\". Trucks was a featured guest guitarist on \"Escondido\" (check out his solo on \"Missing Person\"), so his appearance here is a natural fit. The fact that \"Breeze\" works on so many levels is a testament not only to JJ Cale's songwriting ability. but to Eric Clapton's genius as a band leader. He succeeded in gathering a disparate collection of musicians, from the thirty-something Trucks to the eighty-something Nelson and share in this tribute- a true appreciation.", "id": 301668}

{"review": "This is a very good tribute to the great JJ Cale. It is a little variable in quality but overall is a fine album of JJ's songs, covered with genuine respect and affection by some great musicians who liked and admired him. As the title suggests, Eric Clapton is the backbone of this album. He appears as either guitarist, singer or both on all the tracks and is excellent throughout. He captures the spirit of JJ in both his vocals and in his guitar work, which is quite some feat. Cale was a very fine guitarist indeed under all the relaxed-sounding cool, with a subtlety of touch that only genuine masters like Clapton can come close to emulating. He puts in fine performances here and he makes this the very good album it is. Other guests perform with varying success: Tom Petty is brilliant on both Same Old Blues and The Old Man & Me, and Mark Knopfler is (as always) unmistakeably himself which works fantastically well on Someday. It is great to hear Christine Lakeland on backing vocals in the lovely closer Crying eyes. Willie Nelson is, of course, just Willie Nelson, which I think is absolutely great on Songbird and absolutely awful on Starbound, and John Mayer is OK but just a bit lacklustre. This is an album of excellent music played by fine musicians and is generally a very successful collaboration. It is also right and proper that a genuine, quality tribute should be paid in this way to JJ Cale. There is enough excellence here for me to round 4.5 stars up to 5, despite the odd blip. My only question is - will I play this in preference to my dearly loved, scratchy old vinyl originals? Possibly not: Naturally, Okie, Shades and others are still magnificent albums which I still play very regularly, and I can't really see me playing this in preference to them very often. Nevertheless, this album is still very well worth having - it has some terrific music-making on it and it's a fine tribute to a truly great man. Recommended.", "id": 301668}

Other guests perform with varying success: Tom Petty is brilliant on both Same Old Blues and The Old Man & Me, and Mark Knopfler is (as always) unmistakeably himself which works fantastically well on Someday. It is great to hear Christine Lakeland on backing vocals in the lovely closer Crying eyes. Willie Nelson is, of course, just Willie Nelson, which I think is absolutely great on Songbird and absolutely awful on Starbound, and John Mayer is OK but just a bit lacklustre. This is an album of excellent music played by fine musicians and is generally a very successful collaboration. It is also right and proper that a genuine, quality tribute should be paid in this way to JJ Cale. There is enough excellence here for me to round 4.5 stars up to 5, despite the odd blip. My only question is - will I play this in preference to my dearly loved, scratchy old vinyl originals? Possibly not: Naturally, Okie, Shades and others are still magnificent albums which I still play very regularly, and I can't really see me playing this in preference to them very often. Nevertheless, this album is still very well worth having - it has some terrific music-making on it and it's a fine tribute to a truly great man. Recommended.", "id": 1294450011}

{"review": "This is a great tribute to songwriter JJ Cale that I will play often. The musicianship and singing of all the artists really brings his songs to life. While Cale wasn't known as a performer, his songs are some of the best known in modern rock music. If I have any quibble at all with this CD, it's that the songs are too short! Just when the songs pick up steam at the 2-3 minute mark, the sound man turns down the volume and the song is over, just like the old days of music when fade out was the most common way to end a song. I think these artists should have been left alone to play out the songs to 4-5 minutes if they wanted to. A song should have a natural ending when the music is actually over; don't artificially end it just as the guitars get strumming and the singer is still belting out the lyrics! Other than this quibble, this is a Must Buy.", "id": 301668}

{"review": "Since the beginning of the 1970s, Eric Clapton's career has largely been sustained in spite of, not because of, his skills on the instrument he is known for, the guitar. Instead of long solos and lengthy improvisational jams, he has focused more on groove and melody. No other artist influenced Clapton more in this direction than J.J. Cale. J.J. Cale's music was simple and direct, not a lot of flash, not a lot of noodling. His songs rarely ever went over three minutes in length. There was something in this approach that obviously struck a chord with Clapton, who tired of the 'Clapton is God' image. Everyone knows that Clapton has mined Cale's catalog throughout his career (i.e 'Travelin' Light, River Runs Deep, Anyway the Wind Blows') aside from 'After Midnight' and 'Cocaine' which he practically made into standards of his own. He collaborated with Cale on the excellent 'The Road to Escondido' in 2006, but 'The Breeze' was Clapton's first real tribute to his friend, who died in 2013 at age 74. Clapton got several other musical friends with a deep affection for Cale's music to appear throughout the album, including Mark Knopfler, Tom Petty, Willie Nelson, and Derek Trucks. The obvious appreciation they have for the music shines through in the almost effortless way they nearly slink and slide their way through each song. Clapton himself opens the album with an almost perfect note-for-note version of 'Call Me The Breeze' where his vocals sound almost exactly like Cale's on the original. For a neat effect, he used the original intro to the song before he and the band kick full into gear. Clapton teams with Tom Petty on a bouncing 'Rock and Roll Records' where they replace the original's horn melody line with their guitars, giving the song an extra kick. I was never a big John Mayer fan, but he surprised me on his two main features 'Magnolia' and 'Lies'. His vocals were excellent on both songs, but especially 'Magnolia' where he shows a surprising amount of nuance. It's hard not to tap your feet to 'Lies' which has really relaxed breezy beat, Don White, a long-time member of Cale's band, and whose vocals could be easily mistaken for Cale himself, contributes a lilting version of 'Sensitive Kind' and also 'I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me) which is one of the few songs on the album that really gallops, since most of the performances rarely rise above a relative simmer. Clapton and Mark Knopfler juice up 'Train To Nowhere' with a terrific shuffling rhythm, while Willie Nelson's twang seems perfectly suited for 'Songbird'. Another highlight is Derek Trucks, who contributes some stellar slide guitar on 'Starbound' and 'Crying Eyes'. His slide on 'Crying Eyes' is especially noteworthy, some of the prettiest, most delicate playing you'll ever hear. You can definitely hear Duane Allman in his playing. All the guitarists' playing throughout this album is excellent, if not overly exciting. Although the solos are kept to a minimum, everyone compliments each other and the instruments blend in seamlessly without getting in each other's way. As Eric Clapton approaches turning 70 next year, he's spent most of the last 15 years collaborating with artists who have influenced him, or whose work he admires. Whether it was B.B. King, Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood, or J.J. Cale, Clapton has long since stopped worrying about chart success and focused on performing music he loves. Critics have always been respectful of his recent work, although many wonder how much Slowhand has left in the tank. I'd say judging by the fact that 'The Breeze' was the #2 album on the top 200 album chart, that fans still think Eric Clapton has plenty left to say.", "id": 301668}

I will say that I've been losing respect fiur their music for the last few years, and this album has solidified that. They now sound like everything I despise about the modern American music scene, shallow, over produced, derivative garbage. Songs About Jane literally saved my life as a bipolar individual going through a pretty disastrous patch in my life when it came out. It Won't Be Soon Before Long, was a worthy successor. Hands All Over took a while, but eventually it grew on me, I even managed to find a few gems on Overexposed. But this, no hope. Like I said on my Overexposed review, you get one, that was it.

{"review": "This very well may be one of the shortest reviews I have ever written, but the truth is there really isn't much TO say about Maroon 5's latest album, \"V.\" It's a straightforward, uncomplicated pop record and enjoyable enough in the moment, but with its lack of catchy hooks and overabundance of generic, shallow lyrics, it also strikes me as instantly forgettable. Not that it doesn't have its moments. The lead single, \"Maps,\" piqued my interest with its unique melody line, and \"Unkiss Me\" is a mid-tempo ballad which has Adam Levine showcasing a lower vocal register which suits him rather well. A personal highlight is \"It Was Always You,\" a smooth electro-groove which reminds of me something Rick Astley would be proud of. (And yes, I totally mean that as a compliment, lol.) Unfortunately after the first four or five tracks the shine wears of, and the rest of the songs become indecipherable from one another. No catchy choruses to sing along with, no thought-provoking lyrics, and certainly nothing that will go down as a Maroon 5 classic several years from now. Like I said, nothing here is offensively terrible in itself - well, except for maybe \"Sugar,\" in which Levine's squealing reaches cringe-worthy new heights - but as an album it just feels so bland and uninspired. Plus, watching this band of 30-something men compromise their artistic integrity in trying to relate to the mindsets of 12-year-old girls just doesn't work, and is in fact kind of sad. No disrespect intemded as I realize that's the market for radio these days, but I imagine they're alienating a good segment of their original fan base in doing so. Of course, Maroon 5's entire catalog going back to the \"Songs About Jane\" days is nothing if not catchy pop, but that's the key word - catchy - and up until the \"Overexposed\" era it was music you could tell they at least WANTED to be making. Unfortunately the good majority of \"V\" comes off as not much more than random button pushing. In spite of those criticisms I do still consider myself a fan. But personally I think they peaked with the underrated \"Hands All Over,\" an album which successfully managed to blend meaningful songwriting with mainstream pop sensibilities which resulted in nearly every track having its own distinct identity. (\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\" remains their best CD overall, in my opinion.) Ideally I would rate this about 2.5 stars, but I'm rounding up to three giving it the benefit of the doubt. I have certainly heard worse, and I'm not going to throw it in the garbage or anything like that. It just won't be leaving the shelf very often.", "id": 37}

{"review": "\"What the (explicit), I got nothing to lose...\" frontman Adam Levine feistily confesses on the track \"New Love\", summing up what Maroon 5's fifth studio album has to say in a single verse. That the Californian band has been aching to reach the same success they achieved with their smash hit \"Moves Like Jagger\" is not breaking news and it seems that even after the unsuccessful attempt in 2012 with the ambitious \"Overexposed\", they seem to be pushing forward through the same familiar territory, still in high hopes. Maroon 5's persistence becomes evident on \"V\", where they prove to have mastered the craftsmanship of contemporary pop ditties. The commander in chief here is once again Max Martin (Britney Spears, Usher, Taylor Swift) and the result swerves from the unexpected. Electronic rhythms and synthesizers service the songs where their readiness for mainstream radio and dance clubs is concerned, leaving most tunes to fall short of any sort of endurability. That's not to say some songs don't deserve the airplay they bargain for. \"Animals\", \"It Was Always You\" and \"Sugar\" are all sheen radio ready tracks that'd comfortably fit in on mainstream pop playlists, resounding with the same carefreeness of songs by Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and artists alike. Even when the production breathes without the predominant dance-pop apparatus on the much-lauded duet with Gwen Stefani, Maroon 5 can't help but resort to bland songwriting in favor of a memorable hook. Regardless of if they'll successfully recreate the same scenario they enjoyed in 2011 or not, it seems that \"V\" may be more focused on simply maintaining Maroon 5's relevance in contemporary music, rather than making a significant musical statement or at least a satisfying piece of product.", "id": 37}

{"review": "After hearing \"Animals\" (2nd track, 2nd official single), and already hearing \"Maps\" and \"It Was Always You\" (1st track, 1st official single, and 3rd track, promo single released between the two official singles, respectfully), I pre-ordered this album on August 27, expecting to receive it September 2 around 8:00 p.m. I thank Amazon for surprising me by delivering it a day early, I found \"V\" on my doorstep around 1:00 p.m. on September 1. Now having said that, anyone reading this has most likely already made up their mind about this album and is reading this out of pure curiosity, and that's fine. For those still contemplating their decision on purchasing \"V\", I'd like to help. So instead of comparing this album to those that have come before from Maroon 5 (of which I own all), because you can already find those types of reviews all over the internet and Amazon, I'll answer a question you may or may not have asked yourself while tying to decide whether or not this album is worth your money: \"What exactly am I getting out of this CD?\". I'll start by saying that this album is not worth your money. For $5.00 more than the standard version, I find only 3 additional tracks to be horribly underwhelming. As for what exactly you will get from this album, I'll tell you. You'll receive an appealing but flashy cover that's crisply designed onto a cardboard sleeve (sadly; jewel cases are much more sturdy and provide better protection for the disc). You'll be paying for an accompanying booklet that only contains pictures, however nice, and credits (I much prefer lyrics to be included, but oh well). That being said, your money is also going towards a lot of great music. There is only one song that I don't enjoy, which is \"Feelings\" (track 10). That may be just my taste, but I don't really like the dance-y beat, but I could live with it if it weren't for lyrics such as \"so high we f*** the sky,\" and not because of the content (I purchased the explicit version intentionally), but because it's only delivered half-heartedly, almost reluctantly, by an otherwise outstanding vocalist Adam Levine. If you haven't yet listened to the previously listed singles, do, and they'll give you a pretty good idea of what this album sounds like, albeit not a complete representation. So for the reason being that by now you've heard the singles, or if you haven't you're about to, I'll skip the summaries of the first 3 tracks and let you come to your own opinions of them. Instead, I'll give a general idea of the sound and quality of each song starting with track 4. 1. \"Maps\"-Single 2. \"Animals\"-Single 3. \"It Was Always You\"-Promo Single 4. \"Unkiss Me\"-With a fresh, hypnotizing beat, neatly delivered and relatable lyrics, and nice flow in all the right places, this powerful ballad begs to be released as \"V\"'s 3rd official single, and wo definitely do well if it happens. 5. \"Sugar\"-Another potential single that contrasts perfectly with the previous track, its silky sweet beat and sugary lyrics with Adam Levine's delivery combine to make this the 5th standout track in a row of \"V\"'s so far 5 song total. 6. \"Leaving California\"-Yet another standout/potential single and ballad, \"Leaving California's\" ascending beat and beautiful hook practically complete the album; if it stopped right here, \"V\" would be a perfect EP. 7. \"In Your Pocket\"- This track is the turning point. With an appealing dance-ish beat and cocky, relatable lyrics and a playful \"Show me yours, I'll show you mine\" this track is good. It just lacks the one aspect that would make it great like the 6 before it. 8. \"New Love\"-Much like the previous track, this song has all the right components: beat, verses, sound; however, they're mixed in with a mismatched hook that detracts from the feeling the rest of the song works so hard (and succeeds in these parts) to invoke to the listener. In this way, the 8th track on \"V\" is almost a standout, just not quite. 9. \"Coming Back For You\"-At this point, the album regains its footing. Track 9 is \"V\"'s 7th standout track. With a perfect hook matched surprisingly well to its accompanying beat, and lyrics that stay stuck in your head but don't annoy as they reside, \"Coming Back For You\" is the redeeming point of this album. 10. \"Feelings\"-And just like that, \"V\" reaches its lowest point. It's not that this song is too electronic or sexual; it's that none of it fits correctly. Track 10's hook is not worthy of comparison to those of any of the other songs here; the same goes for its beat and lyrics like \"Come with me, go f*** that guy\". The worst part is it's placement: after the redeeming track, and before the final cut, both of which seem to be completely different genres on a higher level compared to this song. 11. \"My Heart Is Open\" ft. Gwen Stefani-This album's \"finale\" (not including the bonus tracks) is similar to that of 2010's \"Hands All Over\". A piano-driven slow listen, it would have been a better song had an artist better matched to Levine's sound been found, or if Adam had performed it as a lone vocalist (there doesn't always have to be a collaboration). This track is good, but Gwen Stefani keeps it from being great. Now to the bonus tracks, all of which, though few in quantity, are outstanding in quality. \"Shoot Love\" and \"Lost Stars\", both standout tracks worthy of single status, are separated by Maroon 5's cover of \"Sex and Candy\", which is deliciously sticky in its beat and lyrics, evoking strong desires for the title's contents, and thus making every bonus track included in the deluxe edition of \"V\" worthy of the standard edition's track listing. I know this review is long, and I truly apologize for that, but it is with every intention of helping a future potential purchaser make their decision. So with that said, while this album may not physically be worth its price, its contents more than make up for it. And with that I end this. Best wishes with your decision :)", "id": 37}

Instead, I'll give a general idea of the sound and quality of each song starting with track 4. 1. \"Maps\"-Single 2. \"Animals\"-Single 3. \"It Was Always You\"-Promo Single 4. \"Unkiss Me\"-With a fresh, hypnotizing beat, neatly delivered and relatable lyrics, and nice flow in all the right places, this powerful ballad begs to be released as \"V\"'s 3rd official single, and wo definitely do well if it happens. 5. \"Sugar\"-Another potential single that contrasts perfectly with the previous track, its silky sweet beat and sugary lyrics with Adam Levine's delivery combine to make this the 5th standout track in a row of \"V\"'s so far 5 song total. 6. \"Leaving California\"-Yet another standout/potential single and ballad, \"Leaving California's\" ascending beat and beautiful hook practically complete the album; if it stopped right here, \"V\" would be a perfect EP. 7. \"In Your Pocket\"- This track is the turning point. With an appealing dance-ish beat and cocky, relatable lyrics and a playful \"Show me yours, I'll show you mine\" this track is good. It just lacks the one aspect that would make it great like the 6 before it. 8. \"New Love\"-Much like the previous track, this song has all the right components: beat, verses, sound; however, they're mixed in with a mismatched hook that detracts from the feeling the rest of the song works so hard (and succeeds in these parts) to invoke to the listener. In this way, the 8th track on \"V\" is almost a standout, just not quite. 9. \"Coming Back For You\"-At this point, the album regains its footing. Track 9 is \"V\"'s 7th standout track. With a perfect hook matched surprisingly well to its accompanying beat, and lyrics that stay stuck in your head but don't annoy as they reside, \"Coming Back For You\" is the redeeming point of this album. 10. \"Feelings\"-And just like that, \"V\" reaches its lowest point. It's not that this song is too electronic or sexual; it's that none of it fits correctly. Track 10's hook is not worthy of comparison to those of any of the other songs here; the same goes for its beat and lyrics like \"Come with me, go f*** that guy\". The worst part is it's placement: after the redeeming track, and before the final cut, both of which seem to be completely different genres on a higher level compared to this song. 11. \"My Heart Is Open\" ft. Gwen Stefani-This album's \"finale\" (not including the bonus tracks) is similar to that of 2010's \"Hands All Over\". A piano-driven slow listen, it would have been a better song had an artist better matched to Levine's sound been found, or if Adam had performed it as a lone vocalist (there doesn't always have to be a collaboration). This track is good, but Gwen Stefani keeps it from being great. Now to the bonus tracks, all of which, though few in quantity, are outstanding in quality. \"Shoot Love\" and \"Lost Stars\", both standout tracks worthy of single status, are separated by Maroon 5's cover of \"Sex and Candy\", which is deliciously sticky in its beat and lyrics, evoking strong desires for the title's contents, and thus making every bonus track included in the deluxe edition of \"V\" worthy of the standard edition's track listing. I know this review is long, and I truly apologize for that, but it is with every intention of helping a future potential purchaser make their decision. So with that said, while this album may not physically be worth its price, its contents more than make up for it. And with that I end this. Best wishes with your decision :)", "id": 1297809011}
{"review": "This is a great album. It has been a while since they put out an album but Maroon 5 has achieved a mastery of what works for them. They have their funky dance beats but then can dial it down and sing endearing ballads. You get a little of each in this album. Some albums you buy you have to listen to a few times to get a connection with the songs. With this one each song grabs you the first time and just makes it an enjoyable experience to listen to. An added plus is Adam Levine's single from the movie he was in this summer which is a pretty catchy tune. Good job, guys!!", "id": 37}

{"review": "Thanks to an NPR preview, I'd been listening to this for about a week before it was officially released, and now I'm glad to finally have it in my collection. As a longtime fan of Tom Petty, I'd have to say this is his best in years. Though the initial promotions seemed to indicate that it was a return to his sound on Wildflowers, this is not my interpretation at all. I think it's more accurate to say t's like the rock of \"She's the One\" meets the blues of \"Mojo,\" with some melodic and lyrical callbacks to his older stuff thrown in. Especially the first half, this is a really ripping Heartbreakers album. As far as I'm concerned, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are the best American band there ever was: drawing from rock, folk, country, and (especially on the last two albums) blues, they've created an extraordinary body of work, and Hypnotic Eye only adds to this. From the crunching opener, American Plan B, to the deep and moving Shadow People, Petty's songwriting feels inspired and passionate. Hypnotic Eye is unlikely to storm the charts, with rock giving way to pop and Petty and crew being of an older generation, but fans of classic rock and just plain great music will be fortunate to find this. (UPDATE 8/8/14: I sure was wrong about that statement - This album debuted at #1 on the charts. A well-deserved chart-topper. It's really gratifying to see Petty and the Heartbreakers rewarded in this way after so many years and hits and never a #1 album. I am happy to be proven wrong in that prediction!)", "id": 37}

{"review": "Tom Petty didn't need to do this. He and his group, The Heartbreakers, have so many hits in the can they didn't need to create anything new and be comfortable for the rest of their lives. But it's artists just like Petty who get that itch and it needs to be scratched, and with their 13th studio album (and their first since 2010's \"Mojo,\") Petty is following today's trends and looking back at his very first two albums, realizing they were great and returned to the style they know best - straightforward rock and roll. Younger and hungrier musicians would approach the making of an album with low-fidelity, analog recording and other tricks best reserved for the amateur or the foolish, with the end result being longshots that may ultimately go nowhere. Petty took an old formula that was right there on the shelf and re-created his own version of lightning. This album took two years to make, and the perfection, sloppy as it sounds (as if on purpose), is present. Here's my 30-second from the gut review of each song - 11 tracks at just over 44 minutes: 1. American Dream Plan B - as this was released as a CD single in June 2014 with a $2.00 discount coupon towards the album itself, Petty is still shaking the tree and telling the music industry they still stink. \"My success is anybody’s guess, but like a fool, I’m bettin’ on happiness\" are the truest words on this album. A great opener. 2. Fault Lines - introspective lyrics pepper this Petty of 2014, and he's got enough guilt of his own thank you very much. Great guitar work by Mike Campbell on lead guitar and Scott Thurston take us to the subtle vibrations under the floorboards. It's a little gritty and unfinished, and it's great. Which takes us right into 3. Red River - traveling and moving, she's dodging karma as much as possible and as crafty as she can, but you just can't outrun your fate. Tom wants you to meet him, and he has a solution. More wonderful guitar work by Petty and Campbell. 4. Full Grown Boy - an almost jazzy down-tempo relaxing number, and Petty's telling you about growth, and stretching out, and it's not such a bad thing to make time for yourself and contemplate the world. Nice bit of music here. 5. All You Can Carry - a good old fashioned jam to wash out the taste of the previous slow jam. Sometimes you've got to be ready to go when the disaster strikes, even though it's the kind that doesn't leave a mark on the street. 6. Power Drunk - is this about former President George Bush? Seems like it, because he sings about the man who left so much damage behind because he was on a power trip, and now the \"good man\" has to clean up the mess left behind. Interesting song. 7. Forgotten Man - another song released early in July 2014. It has an old-fashioned vibe to it, and it's stripped back from all of the wild sounds of previous albums. Guilt still reigns supreme though, but the guitar solo gives an authority to Petty's words. I liked it! 8. Sins Of My Youth - another slow burner, and definitely designed to make the listener hear all the confessions of Petty's lyrics. \"I love you more than the sins of my youth,\" he says, and truer words could never be spoken. 9. U Get Me High - using LOL-type texting to serve as modern, he lets go a bit here and swings out as he once again puts his heart on his sleeve. More rocking from the lads, and it's polished and plays as Petty wants it to be - fun and jamming. 10. Burnt Out Town - a bluesy number, and is a cool jam with hot nights, dirty looks, and a bar band vibe page torn right out of The Doors' \"Roadhouse Blues\" book. It still works for me, though, because Petty puts his own spin on it. 11. Shadow People - move over Don Henley's \"A Month of Sundays,\" here's the new old man \"get off my porch\" song for the new Millennium. This final song on the album is slow, sexy, and the lyrics burn hot with an older man's perspective, from gun rights to Judgment Day. The song is a definite departure however, and is a real radical statement. What a way to end an album, with a real viewpoint about today's politics, and where we are, in \"Shadowland,\" not here, and not there. 12. Playin' Dumb (Vinyl, digital and Blu-Ray bonus track) - I'm glad Petty did NOT include this on this album. It's a serious criticism against the Catholic Church to be sure (he was raised Baptist). He really let's the church have it - he sings to light a candle for \"every confession that wasn't on the level, for every man of God that lives with hidden devils...\" Tough stuff, and he has his opinions, but wow... Petty has even said in interviews he didn't know where to \"place\" the song within the framework. I'm so glad he omitted this. After taking the time to listen, as Petty is almost 15 years older than me, and I understand where his ideas and inspirations are coming from. I wanted to give this album 5 stars. Is this his best album to date? No it isn't, and it's flawed, but that's okay, so I'm giving the album 4 stars. His attempt to go back to his roots are admirable, but his seasoning and his experience overshadow his 1979 self. He was angry and hungry then, and had major problems with his first record label when he debuted, but now he's more relaxed, and more introspective, which is fine. It translates well here. I just think he missed the mark by that much, though. I still love his music, but he is the Tom Petty of now, and it shows.

Petty took an old formula that was right there on the shelf and re-created his own version of lightning. This album took two years to make, and the perfection, sloppy as it sounds (as if on purpose), is present. Here's my 30-second from the gut review of each song - 11 tracks at just over 44 minutes: 1. American Dream Plan B - as this was released as a CD single in June 2014 with a $2.00 discount coupon towards the album itself, Petty is still shaking the tree and telling the music industry they still stink. \"My success is anybody’s guess, but like a fool, I’m bettin’ on happiness\" are the truest words on this album. A great opener. 2. Fault Lines - introspective lyrics pepper this Petty of 2014, and he's got enough guilt of his own thank you very much. Great guitar work by Mike Campbell on lead guitar and Scott Thurston take us to the subtle vibrations under the floorboards. It's a little gritty and unfinished, and it's great. Which takes us right into 3. Red River - traveling and moving, she's dodging karma as much as possible and as crafty as she can, but you just can't outrun your fate. Tom wants you to meet him, and he has a solution. More wonderful guitar work by Petty and Campbell. 4. Full Grown Boy - an almost jazzy down-tempo relaxing number, and Petty's telling you about growth, and stretching out, and it's not such a bad thing to make time for yourself and contemplate the world. Nice bit of music here. 5. All You Can Carry - a good old fashioned jam to wash out the taste of the previous slow jam. Sometimes you've got to be ready to go when the disaster strikes, even though it's the kind that doesn't leave a mark on the street. 6. Power Drunk - is this about former President George Bush? Seems like it, because he sings about the man who left so much damage behind because he was on a power trip, and now the \"good man\" has to clean up the mess left behind. Interesting song. 7. Forgotten Man - another song released early in July 2014. It has an old-fashioned vibe to it, and it's stripped back from all of the wild sounds of previous albums. Guilt still reigns supreme though, but the guitar solo gives an authority to Petty's words. I liked it! 8. Sins Of My Youth - another slow burner, and definitely designed to make the listener hear all the confessions of Petty's lyrics. \"I love you more than the sins of my youth,\" he says, and truer words could never be spoken. 9. U Get Me High - using LOL-type texting to serve as modern, he lets go a bit here and swings out as he once again puts his heart on his sleeve. More rocking from the lads, and it's polished and plays as Petty wants it to be - fun and jamming. 10. Burnt Out Town - a bluesy number, and is a cool jam with hot nights, dirty looks, and a bar band vibe page torn right out of The Doors' \"Roadhouse Blues\" book. It still works for me, though, because Petty puts his own spin on it. 11. Shadow People - move over Don Henley's \"A Month of Sundays,\" here's the new old man \"get off my porch\" song for the new Millennium. This final song on the album is slow, sexy, and the lyrics burn hot with an older man's perspective, from gun rights to Judgment Day. The song is a definite departure however, and is a real radical statement. What a way to end an album, with a real viewpoint about today's politics, and where we are, in \"Shadowland,\" not here, and not there. 12. Playin' Dumb (Vinyl, digital and Blu-Ray bonus track) - I'm glad Petty did NOT include this on this album. It's a serious criticism against the Catholic Church to be sure (he was raised Baptist). He really let's the church have it - he sings to light a candle for \"every confession that wasn't on the level, for every man of God that lives with hidden devils...\" Tough stuff, and he has his opinions, but wow... Petty has even said in interviews he didn't know where to \"place\" the song within the framework. I'm so glad he omitted this. After taking the time to listen, as Petty is almost 15 years older than me, and I understand where his ideas and inspirations are coming from. I wanted to give this album 5 stars. Is this his best album to date? No it isn't, and it's flawed, but that's okay, so I'm giving the album 4 stars. His attempt to go back to his roots are admirable, but his seasoning and his experience overshadow his 1979 self. He was angry and hungry then, and had major problems with his first record label when he debuted, but now he's more relaxed, and more introspective, which is fine. It translates well here. I just think he missed the mark by that much, though. I still love his music, but he is the Tom Petty of now, and it shows.

{"review": "Tom Petty is back for another studio album with the Heartbreakers and he's a bit pissed off. On \"Hypnotic Eye\" Petty and the Heartbreakers show why they're one of the best bands in the business and that they are not about to change their style to chase the current pop sound. Instead, this album brings us Petty and the Heartbreakers rocking out with the confidence of a band that is secure in the sound they've created for decades. While Petty has always touched on political issues he releases his rage over the disillusionment in the USA in song here on tracks like the opener, \"American Dream Plan B,\" with lyrics like \"Well, my mama so sad / Daddy’s just mad / ‘Cuz I aint gonna have the chance he had.\" And on \"Shadow People\" where he sings, \"I ain't on the left, and I ain't on the right, I ain't even sure I got a dog in this fight.\" \"Forgotten Man\" is one of the hardest rocking blistering rock and roll tracks you'll hear clocking in at a short 2:49 that makes you want to hit repeat a few times. Petty throws some variations in between the rocking numbers with songs like \"Full Grown Boy\" with it's jazzy vibe and dabbles in bossa nova on \"Sins of My Youth.\" Overall this is a pretty darn good record from Petty and the Heartbreakers that will be a must-listen for Petty fans and also an album that a casual fan will enjoy. It may not spark any radio hits, but at this point in his career I doubt Petty is worried about where he's going to chart on Billboard as much as he is getting his message across.", "id": 37}

{"review": "This exciting, fresh, creative, flashy, arousing, new piece of mastery from Mr. Petty and his friends is awesome! If you have been waiting for that 70's or 80's classic music to make it into this century here it is! Honestly, I have to say I am a big fan of Petty so this could make the review a bit one sided. But, I have to state I am the hardest on artists and groups that I really like. This is a flowing combination of 80's music with the creativity of 2014. It really shows off the talent of the band members and especially Mike Campbell. Mike is in his 20's on this album, he's fantastic! Favorite songs, U get me high, American Dream Plan B, Fault lines, I could go on! Recorded over 3 years, it is art, it is what many albums should be, great songs put on an album, not an album made to make an album. Many groups can't create new, great work after being together for a long time, this is an exception. If you are a Petty fan buy it, not a fan buy it, traveling the galaxy and your just stopping by, buy it, it's what Earth is all about!", "id": 37}

{"review": "Fantastic album. I've purchased a decent amount of music off Amazon and I believe this is my first review. I just had to leave a positive note about this album. I had a huge Petty fan, and while I liked his last few albums, I didn't love them. I love this album. The quality that is maintained throughout this entire album is top notch. Honestly, I don't think it drops off at all and about eight songs could be legitimate singles. CD came in semi-cheap folding cardboard packaging, but I've noticed that with a lot of music these days, so I won't hold it against the album. I think they are trying to replicate vinyl albums by having it open up with the CD in one pocket and the booklet in the other. I find the booklet very interesting because it included the recording dates. A few of the \"blues-ier\" songs were recorded shortly after Mojo and it's kind of fun to track the progress from 2011 to 2014 and the transition to just good ol' rock and roll like their first few albums. Not to say the album doesn't fit together, it is a very cohesive album with the theme of the American Dream slipping away running throughout and the songs blending together well. A couple of times they literally transition from one to the other. I think this is Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers finest work in decades. The CD is a banger and you'll find yourself jamming out from beginning to end. I've already made a complete fool of myself multiple times in traffic and expect to many times more. Well done Tom, this is a true rock and roll album and a point of light in an otherwise depressing music landscape.", "id": 37}

Well done Tom, this is a true rock and roll album and a point of light in an otherwise depressing music landscape.", "id": 1297809011}
{"review": "Well, we have some real divergence in opinions here today. Mostly 4-5 stars but a very vocal minority who can't stand this latest effort by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers. You can put me in the first camp. Hypnotic Eye had me nailed probably by the 4th song or so. This is definitely a rocker of an album and one that goes back, way back in its sound. It's as if Wildflowers, Echo, Southern Accents and so many others in the last decade(s) had never existed. Mudcrutch was a revelation to me as it was really the first album where the Heartbreakers got to show off their skills. I've played Scare Easy and Lover Of The Bayou so many times that there are grooves in my hard drive. :) Hypnotic Eye has the same extended instrumental solos that weave in and out, building up to crescendos. Like I said, this album seriously rocks!", "id": 37}

{"review": "I've been a big Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers fan since I was a kid waaaay back in the 1980s. I've seen them in concert many times, I own every album plus the two box sets (Playback and The Live Anthology) and several, um.... \"unofficial\" live recordings. That being said, this new album is the best album, from beginning to end, that they've put out since the early 90s. Seriously! I had heard the advance word that it was great, but all too often the hype can be a little bit overblown. Not in this case though. This album simply rocks! It's been four years since their last release (Mojo), but it was worth the wait. Great job, guys! The North American tour kicks off on August 3 in San Diego and runs through October 10.", "id": 37}

{"review": "I purchased this album on CD shortly after it's release. While I liked the songs well enough, I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality. It didn't seem to have the 'open, jangle-y crispness' that I've come to associate with the Heartbreakers sound. It sounded more like 'crowded, loud and overbearing'. So, despite the 2 negative vinyl reviews I read here, I ordered the Reprise single LP (both elsewhere and cheaper) hoping for something more in alignment with my expectations. The vinyl arrived with a pressing defect and was subsequently returned for refund. The vinyl sounds real nice, but does not exactly sound like analog quality so the reports of this album being recorded with Pro Tools may have some merit. I have not replaced it as of yet. At this point, I've owned this release on CD, vinyl, 320 download, and flac download. Be assured that the sound quality on both the LP and the flac download is MUCH, MUCH better than what I heard on the commercial CD release. The album was originally recorded in 24bit. The CD and the 320 download are 16bit as opposed to the 24bit vinyl and 24bit flac download. The CD has, admittedly(see below), been produced SPECIFICALLY for the iphone/earbud crowd. If you plan on listening on a home stereo system you will want DEFINITELY want the flac version or the vinyl. Be advised that you will need to convert the flac file to .wav format before you can burn it to CD-R. I used Audacity to do this. Strange times we live in, they produce a CD for the download people and ask the CD people to buy a download... If you haven't already purchased it, skip the factory-pressed commercial CD altogether and buy the flac download from Petty's site. If you have purchased the CD, sell it and buy the flac if you were looking for a crisp and clear sounding album on CD. Or maybe just keep the case to put your new $20 flac CD-R in. Sigh. Trying to buy a copy of this album has been a real education for me, that's for sure. The two-stars is for the shoddy vinyl pressing from Reprise and for monkeying around with the converting files nonsense. ************************************************************* Music forum post made by Hypnotic Eye album producer Ryan Ulyate: \"The CD has peak limiting, as is every CD I've been involved with since I started working with Tom on Highway Companion. It's not the loudest CD out there, and most people (at least those that listen to it without analyzing the waveform) seem to like it. I've been railing against the loudness wars for years and we think the best way around it is to make CD's that are competitive in the marketplace level-wise and offer alternatives for those that are really into the best possible sound -like you all! As with The Live Anthology, Mojo and Damn The Torpedoes (deluxe edition) the Vinyl, FLAC, Blu-Ray and HD Tracks versions do not have any peak limiting (as will the Pono version which will be available when Pono comes out in the fall). They are the same resolution that we made the album in -and in the case of Hypnotic Eye it's 24bit 48K (due to the fact that the Avid Venue system we use for tracking at the Clubhouse has a max sample rate of 48K). The increased bit depth is what really makes a difference, that's why we wanted to offer more than just a 16 bit CD. The deluxe vinyl is 180 gram, has a bonus track and deeper grooves with about 2-3 db more level. It also has a very cool etching on side 4. It's for those that want the very best. The 2 sided vinyl is 140 gram and for those on more of a budget. It still was mastered from the full resolution digital files (no peak limiting). The bottom line is than we're making music for the real world, in the best way we know how.

The album has some great riffs and Campbell plays some incredible solos as well. Tom Petty is still making great, relevant music, which we should all be thankful for.", "id": 1297809011}

{"review": "My brother asked for these binders for his birthday gift. They were very well-priced, so I ordered a dozen for him. The only issue I had is that the shipping was insanely high: shipping costs doubled the price. These are not heavy, just oversized, so I thought the shipping costs were out of line. Other than that, the product is great, the vendor shipped quickly, and the whole transaction was smooth and as expected.", "id": 374791011}
{"review": "This will not withstand much use. The hinges are not very strong, nor is the material that the entire binder is made of.

{"review": "WHO NEEDS IT? This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard. You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future. As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features. HOW GOOD IS IT? - Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable. - As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K. - The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment. - The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable. - It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment. You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy. END OF REVIEW ______________________________________________________ What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share. WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features) - HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment. - HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows). - ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable. - Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices. - This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs. THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCE HDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features: - Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection. - Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver. - 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards - 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this - Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras. - Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p. The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables: * Standard HDMI Cable * High Speed HDMI Cable * Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet * High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet Of the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable. Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end. -- >> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "id": 202505011}

THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCE HDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features: - Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection. - Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver. - 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards - 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this - Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras. - Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p. The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables: * Standard HDMI Cable * High Speed HDMI Cable * Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet * High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet Of the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable. Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end. -- >> Brush your teeth, it's the law! <<", "id": 6320312011}

{"review": "This is the HDMI cable to get right now: an HDMI 1.4 cable at a good price. HDMI 1.4 HDMI 1.4 is the latest standard (as of November 2010 at least). It is backward compatible with other HDMI gear (mine all are HDMI 1.3 compliant). And it will be more useful to you if your TV supports HDMI 1.4 networking. I was not able to test the Ethernet networking capability of this cable, but I think the idea behind it is a good one.

It would have been a lot easier if I could have just set up my TV's internet connection, and allow all of my components to share it. That's what HDMI 1.4 promises to let you do--as long as all of your hardware, including the cables, supports it. This cable will support that functionality; it's more \"future-proof\" than the HDMI 1.3 cables I have been using.

{"review": "This is an excellent deal on a superb quality high speed HDMI 1.3x cable that also complies with the HDMI 1.4 standard. It supports video at 1080 resolution with the capability to go even higher, and sound quality seems just as good as it is with a digital optical cable. The 2M length of the cord seems just right for most devices that we have them connected to. Enough to comfortably connect without having too much extra cable hanging from the devices. The cable is thinner than some of the thick Monster cables I have used before, which makes it more flexible and easier to maneuver around devices. There really is no point paying a higher amount for Monster HDMI cables that sell for ridiculous amounts at retails stores. I remember those were at $100+ a few years ago, haven't checked their prices lately. Well, don't need to check price because the price on the Amazon Basics cables beats them hands down any day. The cable quality seems to be sturdy. The plugs fit into the TV/devices well, and the picture and sound quality is great. Not much to think about, this one's a no brainer!", "id": 202505011}

{"review": "I actually ordered a Chromecast the day it was announced from Google. However the next day, I was told that they were available for purchase at bestbuy. I was anxious to try it out so I went and bought another one and gave it a try. Setup was easy and within 5 minutes, I was watching a youtube video on my 65\" TV. The quality was VERY good. I tried a 1080p video first \"Big Buck Bunny\" and it looked, played and sounded wonderful. Next, was playing music from my Google Play music app. Same result, the music sounded great. I moved on to my Macbook Pro, and again, the videos was clear, without lag, no audio sync problems at all. Same for my Windows PC. Those considering buying the Chromecast should consider what the Chromecast actually is and does, instead of what they wish it could do. So here are some facts: 1. The Chromecast is not a streaming device of local digital content. In other words, it does NOT play digital music and videos that is stored locally on your network drives or computers. However there is a work-around for this: Use PLEX Media Server. If you don't already have it, here's the link: [...] Once you download it and point it to your files,it will act as a proxy and allow your music and videos to be played on your HDTV using the Chromecast through the Chrome browser. Simply launch the PLEX Media Manager in Google Chrome browser. Pick a file to play, Hit the Google Cast button and you'll get seamless playback of your own files. [Edit: Please see comments to see an alternative method]. 2. The Chromecast is not a DLNA or Miracast device or Apple's airplay. This is a lot like my number 1 fact, but I wanted to make this clear. If you want device mirroring (display whatever is on the device's screen), the Chromecast, is NOT for you. The video and music does NOT stream from the controller device (Your computer, tablet, smartphone). Chromecast works by fetching the content from a website or cloud service itself, NOT from the device you're using. Here's what's cool about that: A. You could start playing a video using your smartphone,tablet,computer as a \"remote\" and still be able to browse the web, play a game, check your social apps, write a book report, put the device to sleep,turn the device completely off (I tried this myself), or leave the house, and the video WILL still play without issues. B. Your battery life is saved! Because your phone, tablet or computer (not plugged in)is not actually streaming to the Chromecast, your battery consumption is minimal. You could Play dozens of movies over several days and still have most of your battery life remaining (Of course this would depend on what else you do with the phone, tablet or computer and how long your device can stay in standby). C. Every device connected to the Chromecast on the same network can take control of playback, adding to the queue (what's going to play next). Pause, fast forward, rewind, etc. So if your roommate, friend, parent, sibling, spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend has to leave with their device, you don't have to worry. D. You can play content from thousands upon thousands of sources using your computer. Using Google Chrome, nearly every webpage, that has content can be viewed using Chromecast. Of Course, this depends what protocols the site is using. If the site has trouble playing on your computer, then it probably won't work well on the Chromecast, either. 3. Chromecast IS cross platform (works with multiple devices). As I said, I tried it with several devices with different operating systems. At the time of this review, it works on Windows PC's, Macbooks, and android devices. The app for iOS devices is coming soon. Everyone knows the Apple App store has stringent policies and at times, it can be a long process. Look at the Onlive game streaming app. We won't get into how Apple has been trying to eradicate google applications from it's ecosystem anyway. I'm sure the app is waiting for approval. Just be patient. [Edit: Please see comments for a reply to it working on iOS devices]. There are several youtube videos that can show you how to set it up or how well it works. I made a video myself: [...] Watching my video isn't required, but it does help to verify what I'm saying. 4. The device you use with the Chromecast, must be on the same WIFI network. The important word here is WIFI. If you are trying to use it, with a ethernet (wired) connected device, even though it's on the same network, it will NOT work! Yes, that sucks, but not being able to use sink water in your gas tank, kind of sucks to. If that's a deal breaker for you, then you shouldn't purchase it. It's how they chose to implement it's use. It is, what it is. [Edit: Please see comment section]. 5. The Netflix 3 months free limited time offer is over! I received 3 months free with both my purchases. I live in the eastern time zone. Even though I bought my second Chromecast on July 25th at 6:46pm. I realize that when the offer was no longer available, it should have been posted immediately so that consumers could factor that into their decision to buy the Chromecast. Instead of calling it a limited time offer, they should have said \"while supplies last.\" Never the less, the features and functionality of this device has nothing to do with the inadequacy of a bonus offer. To help people make a decision about a future purchase and if it will work for THEM in the home configuration they have, is paramount in my book. 6. The Chromecast REQUIRES power through USB connection or from your wall outlet. The required peripherals ARE provided to you in the retail box. Some people are saying if you have an HDMI 1.4 compatible port on the back of your TV, the device can be powered by the HDMI port alone, without the USB cord connected. I CANNOT speak to that, as my HDMI ports did NOT power the Chromecast. I had to use the provided USB wire and connect it to a USB port available on the back of my TV. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the purchase. I've read some of the other reviews, particularly the 1 and 2 star reviews, because it's an indicator of what can possibly go wrong with the device. I would suggest that people make their decision based on people that have actually bought the device and have experience connecting, setting it up and ACTUALLY using the device. Most of the bad reviews are from people that have not used it, didn't understand the features of the device, or, to be honest, has a problem with the competition between Apple and Google and wants to dismiss this product because of their affinity for Apple products. Look at the features and functions of this device and consider them for yourself. I hope this review helps someone who may be considering this device. EDIT: Recently more apps were added with chromecast support, including the PLEX app! Other editions are: HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Pandora, Vevo, Redbull.tv, Songza, Post TV, Viki, Real Player Cloud.", "id": 13447451}

{"review": "So I have no idea why Amazon decided to remove my 1500+ Helpful Review. I have had this product for weeks so I was able to give more than just a short term insight. In fact, I like the idea of it so much that I ordered two additional through Amazon yesterday before they sold out (Google only gave me one to test with). Anyway, I was contacted by fellow Amazon shoppers to repost it - so here it is: I want to provide an honest review with an actual understanding of what and how the product works having had it for a couple weeks, without violating my NDA. Look - you can give your \"Review\" once you have in your hands. Make assumptions based off an uneducated guess or incorrect information just looks stupid, I'm sorry. What it Is: It's a HDMI dongle that is powered by Chrome OS that is designed for Streaming. How it Works: You have to connect to the same Wi-Fi network for it to work. Once it's setup you'll see the Chromecast logo and a basic Home Screen with some of the first apps available for Chromecast. A lot of development is going into it, so expect to see more apps from the Google Play store work with your TV. See your phone/tablet/computer more of a remote, rather than an actual streaming device. I only tested on the iOS side (I don't have a Droid) and I can tell you that it works very well. It is NOT like Apple's AirPlay where your screen is mirrored, but rather uses \"the Cloud\" to access your content. It works smoother than AirPlay because it doesn't require buffering from your device, but rather directly to the TV. The only \"syncing\" that occurs is the Cloud communicating to the Chromecast where you're at. For example: I'm watching a Netflix movie and I'm at 1:06:17. I hit the Square button with the wi-fi looking icon called \"Cast\" and it syncs it to my Chromecast. This is only different for web-browsing through the currently Beta Chrome Tab Cast, where it'll show exactly what you're looking on Chrome, onto your TV. It's less functional than straight up mirroring like the Apple TV, but it works. You can't switch between apps and have that show on the screen. This is particularly useful in web-based presentations or while you check your email and your friends are watching Netflix. Battery Drain on Mobile Devices: Because of the way Chromecast works, it's streaming information from the Cloud vs. from your device. I noticed very little increase in the usage of battery on my iPhone 5 and my Macbook Air running Mountain Lion OSX. Support for Streaming Services: Right now, Streaming Service support is limited. Netflix, Google Services (Google Play, YouTube) and Web-based Streaming is allowed. I had issues trying to load Hulu the past couple days, telling me that my browser was unsupported, but I'll update once I get a chance. Power Adapter: The power adapter is an optional requirement. In fact, most modern TV's with HDMI 1.4 or higher spec are supported. The Chromecast can draw power from the HDMI port it's plugged into. If your TV doesn't support that, there's also a USB cable and power adapter included in the box. I have a 2012 LG LED and a 2013 Lenovo 27\" Monitor with HDMI input and the ports power it with no cable. All in all, I feel like it's still a huge work in progress. The SDK will allow for some exciting developments, and I'm happy to say that Google has committed to support this device for quite some time. It gives me piece of mind that this won't become out of date each year. That being said, it's only $35. What a steal for a device that really brings value to any TV.", "id": 13447451}

{"review": "Just got the unit in the mail and set it up. Set up is a breeze: you plug it in to HDMI, plug in the USB for power (either to the TV or to the included USB power plug), connect to its ad-hoc network via the chromecast app and then it's good to go. Content is currently limited to: Google Play media, YouTube, Netflix, and tabs from Chrome browsers on Windows, Mac, and Chromebook (Pixel only at this time). Pandora is coming but not available yet. Content must come from the internet at current and does not support local file streaming (except in a loophole where you can load local files in to a chrome tab, those will be streamed). The streaming functions work really well, there's a small small delay since the device acts as a remote more or less. Web browsing, which is in beta form, is noticeably laggy. Slower than direct streaming (e.g. WiDi, AirPlay or Miracast) but that's due to again, it working more like a remote. It all works very well and if you have any experience with AirPlay from iOS/Mac you'll be used to how it works from an end user standpoint. Technically it works differently as again AirPlay streams from device to AppleTV or similar device, Chromecast doesn't send content from the phone to the Chromecast directly but instead allows the Chromecast device to pull the content from the internet/cloud. The negative of this is no direct mirroring and limits functionality to application specific implementations BUT it allows the device to be turned off or removed from the network or other tasks to be done on the device. So it's an interesting comparison. So what's not so good: It's limited to 2.4GHz wireless, which is slower and more congested than 5GHz spectrum. It does support 802.11 N at least. The selection of content/apps needs work, but it's brand new and will get better - hopefully. But here's the great thing. It only costs $35. Not only that, but if you ordered soon enough it comes with 3 months of Netflix for new OR existing customers (although limited to one code per account so if you buy multiples you'll get multiple codes but can only personally use one of them). When you factor that in you're getting $23.97 of a service you're probably already paying for. The puts the net cost of the device at just $11.03 plus tax. Eleven Dollars!! If you weren't lucky enough to order by then - it's not as good a deal but the device is still worth $35. If you only use this thing a small handful of times, just to quickly stream a chrome tab up on your TV or to watch a youtube video it's worth it. But with how well this has been selling I imagine we'll be seeing more apps support it soon. Pros: +++ Cost - $35 or $11 depending on when you ordered ++ Cross platform (Android 2.3 or higher, iOS 6 or higher, Chrome for Windows, Mac, Chromebook) + Easy setup + Small/portable (just need to bring the USB power and the device) + includes HDMI extension, usb cable, and usb power supply (amazing for the cost) Cons: - Limited content for now (no local content either) Overall, again it's not perfect. I'd love to have seen 5GHz wireless support and I want more content/apps and I'd love to see some direct streaming or an easy way to get photos streamed (I hear you can do videos but haven't tested yet). But for $11 I'll bet on the future of the device. -= Notes on content source =- I've seen on forums that people have questions about streaming from your device or the playback of local files. Chromecast, in the current form, does NOT support streaming of local content. The source for all content must be online, your phone/tablet is used for content discovery and control/credentials ONLY. There's a loop hole to this in that local files can apparently be opened in a chrome tab and then displayed via Chromecast but this is an exception (see: [...] See the image on this post for a visual representation: [...] -= Notes on power source =- Also for clarity, the pictures that Google uses to show the device plugged in to the TV neglect to show the USB cable attached for power. HDMI is not capable of supplying enough power and as such you need to use the included USB cable to power the device (some TVs have a USB port for debugging/update purposes that can be used). Some reviewers are pointing out that HDMI can power it but it cannot. HDMI only supplies 5V @ 50mA, you'd need roughly 10 times that power (5V @ 500mA) to power this. The included charger is rated for 5V @ 800mA which goes a long way to supporting that HDMI alone cannot power the device. As a side note: MHL ports could power the device but I can't find any confirmation that this supports MHL. To some of you this may seem trivial/obvious but I've had more than one friend ask for clarification about this so I thought it might be of important note here. They did a good job of explaining this at the press event but apparently not as well elsewhere. -= Notes on comparison =- Roku/PS3/360/AppleTV/etc - This isn't meant to compete directly with these, yet. Content is too limited for now. This is changing and should get better. A key distinction is the mechanics of it. While it presents itself as something similar to AirPlay it functions as more of a hybrid between AirPlay and using a remote app (Roku, SmartGlass, Remote, etc) on your smart device. Essentially the content comes from the internet/cloud - the device is used for content discovery and control of the content but the content comes from the internet. Another key distinction is cost. Even at Roku's cheapest this is still 80% cheaper (after netflix cost factored out). Even if this is the full $35, it's still roughly 1/3 the cost of Apple TV. If you already have one, or more, of the devices (I do) the utility of this device is a little more limited in terms of uniqueness but there's one very very key difference, one I'm excited for, and some unique overlaps. With Roku or PS3, your account (e.g. Netflix) has to be tied into the device. So someone visiting has to sign in on their account or use your account. This isn't ideal. But with Chromecast as long as they're signed in on their device (Android/iOS) they can connect to wireless and see the Chromecast and then stream from their own account. This makes it a perfect device for visitors and will ultimately replace my use of a Roku in my guest room for this EXACT reason. While AppleTV with AirPlay rivals this it has two drawbacks: it's iOS only and doesn't allow the streaming device to be used for anything else or to have the screen turned off. The cross platform nature alone is a notable distinction and again a welcome idea for guests. The fact that with Chromcast your phone/tablet can do other things or have their screen turned off will save battery. So while the distinctions aren't as explicit - arguably on the face it functions much like a cross platform Apple TV would in certain cases - the subtle differences add to it. Content discovery (and account info) come from the iOS/Android device but do not require that device to be on/active/present to continue streaming and can be picked up/resumed from another device. Again, these issues don't exist with Roku/PS3 but in those cases your account has to be used on the Roku/PS3 - Chromecast allows for easy user swapping and multiuser control. So while it's hard, on the face, to see the distinction it's there. It's that overlap of features included in a single device that drives this as a unique thing. While it may not be much, for the few dollars it costs it could be of use in those specific scenarios. If you already have multiple devices (e.g. AppleTV and PS3) and don't see specific use in that distinction or cross platform nature then it's likely not for you but I'd bet for $11 you'll find some use for it. -= Questions =- If you have any questions about the device, technology, experience or anything I can try and test let me know in the comments and I'll do my best to answer as soon as possible.", "id": 13447451}
{"review": "Just got the unit in the mail and set it up. Set up is a breeze: you plug it in to HDMI, plug in the USB for power (either to the TV or to the included USB power plug), connect to its ad-hoc network via the chromecast app and then it's good to go. Content is currently limited to: Google Play media, YouTube, Netflix, and tabs from Chrome browsers on Windows, Mac, and Chromebook (Pixel only at this time). Pandora is coming but not available yet. Content must come from the internet at current and does not support local file streaming (except in a loophole where you can load local files in to a chrome tab, those will be streamed). The streaming functions work really well, there's a small small delay since the device acts as a remote more or less. Web browsing, which is in beta form, is noticeably laggy. Slower than direct streaming (e.g. WiDi, AirPlay or Miracast) but that's due to again, it working more like a remote. It all works very well and if you have any experience with AirPlay from iOS/Mac you'll be used to how it works from an end user standpoint. Technically it works differently as again AirPlay streams from device to AppleTV or similar device, Chromecast doesn't send content from the phone to the Chromecast directly but instead allows the Chromecast device to pull the content from the internet/cloud. The negative of this is no direct mirroring and limits functionality to application specific implementations BUT it allows the device to be turned off or removed from the network or other tasks to be done on the device. So it's an interesting comparison. So what's not so good: It's limited to 2.4GHz wireless, which is slower and more congested than 5GHz spectrum. It does support 802.11 N at least. The selection of content/apps needs work, but it's brand new and will get better - hopefully. But here's the great thing. It only costs $35. Not only that, but if you ordered soon enough it comes with 3 months of Netflix for new OR existing customers (although limited to one code per account so if you buy multiples you'll get multiple codes but can only personally use one of them). When you factor that in you're getting $23.97 of a service you're probably already paying for. The puts the net cost of the device at just $11.03 plus tax. Eleven Dollars!! If you weren't lucky enough to order by then - it's not as good a deal but the device is still worth $35. If you only use this thing a small handful of times, just to quickly stream a chrome tab up on your TV or to watch a youtube video it's worth it. But with how well this has been selling I imagine we'll be seeing more apps support it soon. Pros: +++ Cost - $35 or $11 depending on when you ordered ++ Cross platform (Android 2.3 or higher, iOS 6 or higher, Chrome for Windows, Mac, Chromebook) + Easy setup + Small/portable (just need to bring the USB power and the device) + includes HDMI extension, usb cable, and usb power supply (amazing for the cost) Cons: - Limited content for now (no local content either) Overall, again it's not perfect. I'd love to have seen 5GHz wireless support and I want more content/apps and I'd love to see some direct streaming or an easy way to get photos streamed (I hear you can do videos but haven't tested yet). But for $11 I'll bet on the future of the device. -= Notes on content source =- I've seen on forums that people have questions about streaming from your device or the playback of local files. Chromecast, in the current form, does NOT support streaming of local content. The source for all content must be online, your phone/tablet is used for content discovery and control/credentials ONLY. There's a loop hole to this in that local files can apparently be opened in a chrome tab and then displayed via Chromecast but this is an exception (see: [...] See the image on this post for a visual representation: [...] -= Notes on power source =- Also for clarity, the pictures that Google uses to show the device plugged in to the TV neglect to show the USB cable attached for power. HDMI is not capable of supplying enough power and as such you need to use the included USB cable to power the device (some TVs have a USB port for debugging/update purposes that can be used). Some reviewers are pointing out that HDMI can power it but it cannot. HDMI only supplies 5V @ 50mA, you'd need roughly 10 times that power (5V @ 500mA) to power this. The included charger is rated for 5V @ 800mA which goes a long way to supporting that HDMI alone cannot power the device. As a side note: MHL ports could power the device but I can't find any confirmation that this supports MHL. To some of you this may seem trivial/obvious but I've had more than one friend ask for clarification about this so I thought it might be of important note here. They did a good job of explaining this at the press event but apparently not as well elsewhere. -= Notes on comparison =- Roku/PS3/360/AppleTV/etc - This isn't meant to compete directly with these, yet. Content is too limited for now. This is changing and should get better. A key distinction is the mechanics of it. While it presents itself as something similar to AirPlay it functions as more of a hybrid between AirPlay and using a remote app (Roku, SmartGlass, Remote, etc) on your smart device. Essentially the content comes from the internet/cloud - the device is used for content discovery and control of the content but the content comes from the internet. Another key distinction is cost. Even at Roku's cheapest this is still 80% cheaper (after netflix cost factored out). Even if this is the full $35, it's still roughly 1/3 the cost of Apple TV.

{"review": "I was excited when I read that Chromecast would allow me to cast anything from my chrome browser to the tv. Since I've already got a Roku HD Streaming Player (and because not everything I watch is on Netflix), that was really the only feature I really cared about. Given that I ordered early enough for the Netflix promotion, I thought it was worth the $11 investment. Despite my interest in casting Chrome from my computer, my first trial was casting Netflix from my phone. It worked beautifully, and I was very happy with my purchase... until I got around to casting from Chrome. That was an utter failure. We've got enough bandwidth that streaming video has never been a problem, either on the computer or through the Roku. But stream to the computer and Chromecast to the tv, and suddenly stops and starts so much, it's unwatchable. In the moments when it's playing instead or pausing, the video doesn't even match the audio. I still think the Chromecast has potential if more developers start incorporating it, and it works well if all you watch is Netflix and YouTube. But if you want to stream video via Chrome, Chromecast won't cut it. UPDATE: Just a few additional notes, based on comments posted by other users. 1. Chrome tab casting is in beta. Thanks, for the reminder. Let's hope it gets better. 2. Computer performance can significantly impact quality of casting. Our macbook is several years old, so that could be a contributing factor. 3. Video quality settings can improve the performance. We tried the low resolution setting. It improved the performance but not to the point of making it watchable. SECOND UPDATE: I'm not sure if there have been upgrades to the firmware or if it's because I've been careful to make sure all other programs and browser tabs are closed before starting a video, but I've been having more luck with streaming video via Chrome. We use it regularly now, and, although it still has issues, it's no longer \"unwatchable.\" It freezes or produces mismatched video and audio most times we use it, but those issues rarely occur more than once (sometimes twice) in an hour-long show (I do have to restart the video whenever this happens). Given the problems we still have, we don't even bother trying the HD stream. But if other users are having trouble, definitely make sure your computer isn't trying to do anything else while Chrome is casting, and that may help. Although it's still not perfect, it's performing quite capably for a $35 piece of equipment.", "id": 13447451}

{"review": "Trying to get this device to work cost me many hours of frustration, aggravation, and left me feeling less than kindly disposed towards Google. The whole experience was nothing like the enjoyable and entertaining experience that I had been led to expect. I put a lot of time in with Google tech support on the phone and by email, I called my ISP provider, and my modem manufacturer, all to no avail. The device would work flawlessly, then drop out. Much of the time my laptop (running the Chrome browser) couldn't find the device on my home network, even though my TV would be displaying the Chromecast screen saying that it was on my home wi-fi network and ready to cast. The same thing happened with my wife's laptop and her Motorola Razr Maxx smartphone. After many reboots of the device, my Chrome browser, my laptop, my modem, etc., the problem remained; the device would work when it felt like it. As far as I'm concerned, Google support is a joke. I talked and corresponded with numerous techs, all to no avail. It is more than a little frustrating to have to explain the problem over and over each time, and being asked to repeat the same steps over again, all while looking at my TV displaying the Chromecast ready to cast screen. I have to say that the only functional part of the whole process was the Amazon return and refund process. The low price is not a bargain when it leads to this kind of experience. I'm not sure I would ever buy one of these again, even if they iron out the problems I experienced. I already have a wireless connection between my laptop and my TV that works every time; I just can't cast a movie and use my laptop for other things at the same time. Based on my experience, I would say that Chromecast is not a bargain, and was not ready for prime time.", "id": 13447451}

School-freaking-bus yellow and that will alert any teachers that the calculator you or your kid is bringing to class belongs to the school (even if it doesn't because you bought it here), and if that doesn't make matters worse, the imprinted words \"School Property\" on the face plate of the calculator will be sure to create confusion down the road.

{"review": "I am on my third TI-83+ (my first two were stolen). My brother owns an 84, and I can tell you that it offers nothing that the 83 doesn't have. Many of the preloaded apps are useless (an address book? please!), and take up so much space that the memory increase is worthless. The 84 is a continuation of TI's tendency to offer huge amounts of style with little or no substance. I prefer the 83 for its streamlined design. The one improvement is that the slip cover on the 84 does not become loose with a great deal of use, which is a problem I have encountered with my three 83s. It looks as though the USB connectivity could be a plus (for the 83, you had to buy a separate connectivity kit to connect to a PC), however, most buyers will not need to connect their calculator to their PC.", "id": 13900851}

{"review": "Many reviews have focused on what the calculator can do, but that's not all you should consider when buying something. Can something else do it better? Can something else do it cheaper? The answer to both of these questions is yes. So you probably know what this thing can do if you've read the description or the other reviews. It can do all the standard scientific calculator stuff, it can graph functions and with some extra programs it can graph curves that aren't necessarily functions. It can numerically approximate integrals, derivatives, roots, etc. You can create programs and it has financial applications, but I don't know anything about them. It's also portable, which is a nice benefit. The cons are a lack of a CAS, so there's no algebraic integration, factoring, integrating, or solving differential equations to name a few. The resolution is low and there is no ability to do 3D graphs. But these cons aren't enough to warrant the low rating. The proliferation of laptops and FREE programs that perform all these functions and more is the reason. Did you know there's a free graphing calculator with CAS called Geogebra that you can download? It will do almost any calculation the TI-whatever will, it will graph everything with higher resolution, it will numerically and algebraically (if possible) calculate derivatives and integrals, and you can create applets with it. In case it seems like I'm advertising Geogebra (which makes no sense because it's free), check out the new Wolfram Alpha site as well. Another free graphing calculator, among other things, with CAS, including matrix algebra and curve fitting. There are many more similar programs or sites available. Of course, if portability is your main concern and you don't have a laptop, then a TI-84 is an option, but I can't think of any reason that a professional who needs a calculator would want this over what I just mentioned. In particular, I don't know of any mathematician, engineer, or physicist (I only know a few anyway) who actually uses a TI. If they need quick calculations done, they'll use a scientific calculator or for more advanced needs, something like Mathematica or Maple. This leaves the students and parents who are told that this calculator is a must-have, that it will be used throughout their entire career as a student. I'm a high school math teacher. These are not necessary. A calculator may be necessary at times, but believe me, a scientific one will do just fine. Unfortunately, some AP tests deliberately put problems that require a numerical answer and can't be done by hand in any reasonable amount of time. If this applies to you, you may have to bite the bullet and get something like this. In the meantime, students and parents should be asking their schools why these outdated machines are used in place of better, cheaper options.

{"review": "The TI-84 is a good example of where free market pricing fails. As we all know in microeconomics, the price of commodity goods and services is determined by supply and demand. This is generally a good thing as a merchant can optimally sell their wares by pricing it where the per unit revenue * purchase volume is maximized. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out very well for consumers when demand is inelastic, and especially when this is due to artificial external constraints, such as institutional policies. What do I mean by all of this? Well, the TI-84 is in itself not a bad product. It's a sufficient graphing calculator with an established reputation and well-known format. However, the actual utility of the product and its inherent value to users does not match its price, especially relative to its alternatives. After all, the TI-89 is a far superior calculator that can do everything the TI-84 can do, and do it much better (higher resolution screen, faster processor, more memory, more programmable, wider range of software, more graphing and calculator functionality, including 3D graphs, solving of differential equations, etc.), but the TI-84 costs about as much as the TI-89. In fact, you can actually get a used TI-89 for quite a bit less than the cheapest used TI-84. So what on earth is going on? What's the invisible hand of the free market doing? Well, it's exploiting the fact that many schools nowadays prohibit the use of the TI-89 because of a (mostly irrational) fear of cheating. The argument is that anything above a TI-84 is too powerful (i.e. it's _too good_ of a calculator), and students would be able to use it to solve test problems automatically. Well, while this is true to some extent, when I was in high school the TI-89 was allowed, and only the TI-92 was prohibited (due to the similarly unsound argument that having a QWERTY keyboard allows it to be used for cheating more easily--really, that's what school officials claimed), and arguably that AP Calculus program produced higher caliber students and was more academically vigorous than the same calculus courses that today ban the use of TI-89s. Additionally, you can actually add differential equation solving functionality to the TI-84 fairly easily, and it's just as easy to store/view notes on. So it's unlikely that banning TI-89s would prevent cheating to any meaningful degree. So it's really difficult to justify spending more for a used TI-84 than what the far superior TI-89 costs. The situation is even harder to accept when you consider that about 99% of the functionality most students buy their TI-84 calculator for can be duplicated on their smartphone just by pulling up Google. In fact, a smartphone with its browser opened to Google is actually a superior graphing calculator than the TI-84 in many ways. If you install an actual graphing calculator app, then the smartphone wins hands down. But, alas, many students simply don't have any choice but to purchase the TI-84. It's a wasteful situation that rips off students and inflates the price of TI-84s beyond its value as an actual graphing calculator. And if you're not a student, or you're a student in a more enlightened math department that doesn't ban cheaper and better calculators, then there's absolutely no reason to buy a TI-84 instead of the TI-89. The TI-89 has a better key layout and interface, giving you easier access to calculator features, and it's much faster and more powerful. And, especially for programmers, the TI-89 is much funner to program for and easier to program on (e.g. you can create a 3D flight simulator instead of just a 2D side-scroller). If the TI-84 were priced about 40-60% cheaper, I'd give it a 3- or maybe even a 4-star rating. But given that the TI-89 can be had for less, and the prevalence of cheap smartphones, tablets, and handheld gaming devices like the PSP/Vita/DS/Pandora/etc. that all pack so much more value and make the TI-84 look like an antique, the TI-84 is just not worth its current price (new or used).", "id": 13900851}

I believe this is a better choice than the ti-84 plus silver edition as that version has a little more memory and a few more applications and cost about $20 more. I don't care about those extras because i only need it for my math class!!If you need a graphing calculator this is the one to get as it it almost identical to the ti-83 plus and only cost about $10 more.

{"review": "This is a very fast card, particularly suited to not only transferring files quickly but also running as a phone or tablet card for applications as well. In phones and tablets one of the most important things is not just the transfer speed but also the IOPs that the card can deliver. Many class 10 cards have great transfer speeds but terrible and I mean terrible IOPs, often a 5 year old card easily out performs them in IOPs. This card delivers in both areas, fast class 10 transfer speeds 23mb read, 15mb write but also 482 write IOPs and 1668 read IOPs. That's IOP speeds that are slower than an SSD but way faster than a hard disk. Bare in mind that some class 10 cards give 4 write IOPs and you can see why I'm impressed. The only card I have seen outperform it in IOPs it the SanDisk Extreme Pro and they are seriously expensive and not available in 64gb. Testing against the third SanDisk I have, a 32gb ultra, is almost funny as the ultra only gives 15 write IOPs under the same conditions, making this card 30 times faster. What does this mean for normal use, well it translates into an excellent general purpose card, that even if it doesn't have the official fastest transfer speeds will actually perform much better in the real world. Which is why its getting such rave reviews on here for speed (so long as you get a genuine one!) This was tested in my Dell Venue 8 tablet using the built in card reader. For the techies (if you've got this far then I assume you are)I am actually using it to run Server 2012 virtual machines in VMWare workstation and the performance is surprisingly good, I would even call it snappy!

Rather these bigger sized cards run on an upgraded system called exFAT which many devices do not recognize yet. So if you buy a micro sd card for your bb/iphone/galaxy/etc. Make sure that if the memory card is over 32gb, that your device can handle it (see following link). Otherwise just stick with 32gb card or lower. For use on a computer (windows/Mac), you can upgrade the computer software to run exfat and then use the card on your computer.

{"review": "Summary - performs very well compared to Sandisk, which tend to consider the gold standard for microsd card performance and stability. I tested with 64bit CrystalDiskMark and it's very close in performance. The Samsung writes a little faster but reads a bit slower.

If you're using this for a video camera, then the write speed is more important and the Samsung outperforms the Sandisk. As far as long term stability of the card, I've had a lot of off-brand cards and even after several years I've yet to have a failure, so I'd imagine the Samsung is every bit as good as the \"no-name\" cards. >>>Samsung EVO Class 10 Sequential Read : 23.568 MB/s Sequential Write : 16.343 MB/s Random Read 512KB : 23.056 MB/s Random Write 512KB : 21.477 MB/s Random Read 4KB (QD=1) : 6.702 MB/s [ 1636.2 IOPS] Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.609 MB/s [ 392.8 IOPS] Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 7.376 MB/s [ 1800.8 IOPS] Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.389 MB/s [ 339.2 IOPS] >>>Sandisk Ultra Class 10 Sequential Read : 31.053 MB/s Sequential Write : 13.109 MB/s Random Read 512KB : 27.086 MB/s Random Write 512KB : 0.574 MB/s Random Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.217 MB/s [ 785.5 IOPS] Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.390 MB/s [ 339.3 IOPS] Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.073 MB/s [ 750.1 IOPS] Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.419 MB/s [ 346.5 IOPS]", "id": 3015433011}

{"review": "Samsung has always made very high quality products, but their customer service is horrible at best. I'm glad to see Samsung simply their micro SD card line so it is easier to shop. This card is fast, but I will warn you that your device has to be UHS compatible or you will think there is something wrong with this card. Many reviewers are just morons who don't understand their equipment's limitation so they will give a product a bad review. It is xray, magnetic, temperature, water proof, so that means you will need to buy a new device if you drop it in the ocean, but at least your memories will be safe. Keep in mind that the 48MB/s read speed is an average, some people are lucky and get faster cards, some are not as lucky, but I have yet to see any of these cards fall below 40MB/s for continuous read speed. I get a write speed of 17-18 MB/s, decent for a class 10 card that only promises 10MB/s. My previous cards from Samsung, SanDisk, Adata all had a lifetime warranty, but this rebranded card only has a 10 year warranty. Hopefully you won't have to deal with Samsung customer service though, I'd rather swallow my own tongue than talk to them again for any service issue. Please don't believe the Sprint associates when they tell you that you can only use black color cards in their devices, that is just their ploy to get you to buy a card from their store. They attempted to sell my friend a new card because her orange color card caused her phone to reboot because Sprint phones only work with black cards. Amazingly enough, when they replaced the defective battery, the phone didn't have an issue with the orange or gray colored cards. You gotta love Sprint technical support.", "id": 3015433011}

It is xray, magnetic, temperature, water proof, so that means you will need to buy a new device if you drop it in the ocean, but at least your memories will be safe. Keep in mind that the 48MB/s read speed is an average, some people are lucky and get faster cards, some are not as lucky, but I have yet to see any of these cards fall below 40MB/s for continuous read speed. I get a write speed of 17-18 MB/s, decent for a class 10 card that only promises 10MB/s. My previous cards from Samsung, SanDisk, Adata all had a lifetime warranty, but this rebranded card only has a 10 year warranty. Hopefully you won't have to deal with Samsung customer service though, I'd rather swallow my own tongue than talk to them again for any service issue. Please don't believe the Sprint associates when they tell you that you can only use black color cards in their devices, that is just their ploy to get you to buy a card from their store. They attempted to sell my friend a new card because her orange color card caused her phone to reboot because Sprint phones only work with black cards. Amazingly enough, when they replaced the defective battery, the phone didn't have an issue with the orange or gray colored cards. You gotta love Sprint technical support.", "id": 13900851}

Unfortunately, this one had no reviews, but was such a good deal, I decided to purchase it anyway.

Pros: - good price (approx $1 per GB) - full 64 GB of storage in very small package - trusted SanDisk name - validates as true 64GB USB 2.0 device - small metal rod on back for connecting to key chain - BoBoTech shipped quickly Cons: - USB 2 is a bit slow (but USB3 devices are WAY more expensive) - plastic shell seems a bit flimsy (this hasn't been a problem on my smaller 16GB Cruzer) - 1/8\" wider on each side from the connector - very tight fit next to power connector on my laptop Overall, I would recommend this drive if you are looking for a large capacity thumb drive and can live with USB 2 transfer speeds.", "id": 3151491}

I have read about fake usb flash devices being sold (mainly on ebay but also on amazon), so I was a bit wary. Happily, this device is as advertised: I ran a full f3 test (this is the linux equivalent to h2testw) to determine the true capacity - it really is 64 GB and operates at USB 2.0 speeds (ubuntu disk utility benchmark reports average read rate of 35.8 MB/s and write rate of 3.0 MB/s). Pros: - good price (approx $1 per GB) - full 64 GB of storage in very small package - trusted SanDisk name - validates as true 64GB USB 2.0 device - small metal rod on back for connecting to key chain - BoBoTech shipped quickly Cons: - USB 2 is a bit slow (but USB3 devices are WAY more expensive) - plastic shell seems a bit flimsy (this hasn't been a problem on my smaller 16GB Cruzer) - 1/8\" wider on each side from the connector - very tight fit next to power connector on my laptop Overall, I would recommend this drive if you are looking for a large capacity thumb drive and can live with USB 2 transfer speeds.", "id": 1297805011}
{"review": "I am a SanDisk fan. I have always used there products and have been happy with the speed and reliability that they offered. Recently I upgraded from the SanDisk Cruzer 16GB to the 32GB. Right away I noticed it was taking longer to move files. Also from time to time it would just stop during transfer. I left it on all night thinking it would finish and it never did. I Decommissioned that one and bought another a few months later locally this time. I figured I must have gotten a hold of a bad one. The new 32GB Cruzer did the same thing. I just worked around the issues and continued using it. I figured the 32gb model must be flawed in some way. Still being a fan of SanDisk Cruzers I just recently upgraded to the 64GB model. So far it hasn't stopped during transfer but it still seemed to be taking to long. I decided to try a little test. I Purchased a Transcend 64GB thumb drive. I made a folder on my desktop and put 70 files of varying sizes equaling 4.03GB. I copied the folder to my SanDisk and timed it then I did the same with the Transcend. Here are the results: SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35 transferring 70 files equaling 4.03GB it took 18.34 minutes Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive - TS64GJF500E transferring the same took 13.43 minutes I can't speak for the long term reliability of the Transcend thumb because this is the first I've owned. What I do know is that it has a good solid feel, it's cheaper then the SanDisk of the same size, and it's considerably faster. I'm going to continue testing this drive and if it works out and I grow to trust it I will post again and let everyone know. For now I'm going to lean toward Transcend. ** Update as of 01/30/2013 ** I continued using both the Sandisk 64 and the Transcend 64 daily at work. The Sandisk is still significantly slower and occasionally stops responding during transfer. Unfortunately there is no safe way to remove it because technically it's still in use and will not respond to safe ejection procedures both in Windows and Linux. I just do a system shutdown hopping the OS will safely close the open files. I then remove it, restart the machine and try again. This may sound a bit extreme but I do it for a reason. One time it stopped responding on a 3 gig transfer so I let it sit for an hour. When I came back it was still unresponsive so I removed it and took it to another machine I was updating. When I inserted it the new machine I was asked if I wanted to format the Sandisk. I lost everything. Fortunately I had the same data on the transcend so it was just an inconvenience. If however I had been relying solely on the SanDisk it would have been a very long night. The Transcend 64 still continues to surprise me with it's reliability and speed. It is used at work in the daily grind and shows no signs of instability or speed loss. Seven month tested daily, head to head- Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive TS64GJF500E VS SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35. And!... It's Transcend for the Win! Sorry SanDisk, this was a complete miss match. With all your resources, funding, and experience You should have stomped transcend into the ground. You need to get your staff into one room and discuss who dropped the ball and what your going to do about it. Your pro's, this should never have happened and because it did you've introduced doubt into the minds of consumers you had won over years ago. This leaves me wondering was it a shameful loss for SanDisk or is there a new player in the game. In my opinion Transcend just stepped out of the background and into the foreground. They will be given serious consideration during my purchases in the future.", "id": 3151491}

{"review": "I am a SanDisk fan. I have always used there products and have been happy with the speed and reliability that they offered. Recently I upgraded from the SanDisk Cruzer 16GB to the 32GB. Right away I noticed it was taking longer to move files. Also from time to time it would just stop during transfer. I left it on all night thinking it would finish and it never did. I Decommissioned that one and bought another a few months later locally this time. I figured I must have gotten a hold of a bad one. The new 32GB Cruzer did the same thing. I just worked around the issues and continued using it. I figured the 32gb model must be flawed in some way. Still being a fan of SanDisk Cruzers I just recently upgraded to the 64GB model. So far it hasn't stopped during transfer but it still seemed to be taking to long. I decided to try a little test. I Purchased a Transcend 64GB thumb drive. I made a folder on my desktop and put 70 files of varying sizes equaling 4.03GB. I copied the folder to my SanDisk and timed it then I did the same with the Transcend. Here are the results: SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35 transferring 70 files equaling 4.03GB it took 18.34 minutes Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive - TS64GJF500E transferring the same took 13.43 minutes I can't speak for the long term reliability of the Transcend thumb because this is the first I've owned. What I do know is that it has a good solid feel, it's cheaper then the SanDisk of the same size, and it's considerably faster. I'm going to continue testing this drive and if it works out and I grow to trust it I will post again and let everyone know. For now I'm going to lean toward Transcend. ** Update as of 01/30/2013 ** I continued using both the Sandisk 64 and the Transcend 64 daily at work. The Sandisk is still significantly slower and occasionally stops responding during transfer. Unfortunately there is no safe way to remove it because technically it's still in use and will not respond to safe ejection procedures both in Windows and Linux. I just do a system shutdown hopping the OS will safely close the open files. I then remove it, restart the machine and try again. This may sound a bit extreme but I do it for a reason. One time it stopped responding on a 3 gig transfer so I let it sit for an hour. When I came back it was still unresponsive so I removed it and took it to another machine I was updating. When I inserted it the new machine I was asked if I wanted to format the Sandisk. I lost everything. Fortunately I had the same data on the transcend so it was just an inconvenience. If however I had been relying solely on the SanDisk it would have been a very long night. The Transcend 64 still continues to surprise me with it's reliability and speed. It is used at work in the daily grind and shows no signs of instability or speed loss. Seven month tested daily, head to head- Transcend 64 GB JetFlash 500 Retractable USB Flash Drive TS64GJF500E VS SanDisk Cruzer 64GB USB Flash Drive SDCZ36-064G-B35. And!... It's Transcend for the Win! Sorry SanDisk, this was a complete miss match. With all your resources, funding, and experience You should have stomped transcend into the ground. You need to get your staff into one room and discuss who dropped the ball and what your going to do about it. Your pro's, this should never have happened and because it did you've introduced doubt into the minds of consumers you had won over years ago. This leaves me wondering was it a shameful loss for SanDisk or is there a new player in the game. In my opinion Transcend just stepped out of the background and into the foreground. They will be given serious consideration during my purchases in the future.", "id": 1297805011}

{"review": "This is memory from Sandisk, so it is quality as usual. However, there is one thing that you should keep in mind- these high capacity USB flash drives are very, very slow to write to. I would not use this as a day to day drive, since although it holds a ton, it takes ages to move content onto it. I use these as archival drives for video content, and the read speed to plenty fast enough to playback video without stutters, which was my priority and main consideration. If you get this expecting it to be as fast as smaller drives, you will be disappointed, so be aware before buying. That said, it works perfectly, and most content can be streamed from it just fine. If you want a fast, high capacity portable device, I would recommend a usb powered portable hard drive, as even a USB 2.0 HD is much faster to write to than these.

I had to move about 25GB worth of images onto this device for a client and it took about an hr and half to transfer it all. Also, the way this thumb drive is designed (and there are many others in the same design) it can become quite difficult to plug this USB thumb drive into the slot. Especially if you don't have a lot of finger space behind your computer desktop, iMac monitor, etc. With little room, you won't be able to hold down the red slider to keep it in place while you push the thumb drive in. I wish one you slid the USB connector out, it either clicked and stayed there until you release it, or somehow it locked into place instead of being a free sliding connector. 3/5 stars because of the slow speeds and design.", "id": 3151491}

{"review": "I really can't believe this sandisk cruzer offering. I've had several other sandisk cruzers and have always been happy with them, but this 32 gig sandisk cruiser is THE WORST flash drive I've owned and I have several of them of various brands. I can't believe the difference in speed between the 32 gig sandisk cruzer and the other cruzers that I've owned. I've been using flashdrives for system backup and recovery with happy results for years. When I saw the 32 gig cruizer offered for 30 bucks, I bought two of them. When I did a copy all files from my c: drive to the cruizer 32 gig flash it took over 7 HOURS TO COPY 15 GIGS!!!! That's just barely half of the capacity of the drive and the computer wasn't doing anything else. With other flash drives that I own the process usually completes in about 30 minutes. I can't see ANYONE being happy with taking 14 hours to fill the drive, even if they only intend to write to it once. Unfortunately the way these are packaged you pretty much have to destroy the package to get the flashdrive out, so I won't be returning them, but for 30 bucks a piece I think they will both be headed to the trash can. BOTH of the 32 gig cruizers were incredibly slow, when writing, on two different computers both known for writing the same data to a flash drive in 30 minutes. No excuse for it to take more than 7 hours!!! I'm very sad to have to write a bad review about sandisk, as I've always been happy with them in the past. I can only hope that these turn out to be blackmarket drives and not a trend for sandisk. With the lack of speed I can't see any use for this flash drive. My commodore 64 with a cassette tape drive was faster.", "id": 3151491}

{"review": "Sandisk USB ownership history: I own two 4GB Cruzer, an 8G Cruzer Micro, and two 16G Sandisk Cruzer Fit. Pros: + Sandisk quality + Compact size Cons: - Extremely slow transfer speeds (almost unusable in my opinion) Summary; I bought this to replace a budget-priced 8GB Sandisk Micro I've had for over 6 years. It has been extremely reliable and had quite decent transfer speeds. I bought this usb to finally replace that old one and boy was I disappointed. I did a few tests and found that the new drive has only half the write speed and two thirds the read speed of my old drive. At first I thought that the USB must be a fake since the performance was so much slower than any other Sandisk USB I'd ever used but a call to Sandisk customer service resolved that notion. The Sandisk CS person told me that the larger drives are slower because they use a different kind of flash memory. That might have been fine if they had made that clear beforehand. Personally, I didn't buy a brand new USB drive in order to take a step backwards to the speeds I had to put up with 6 years ago, I bought what I thought was a similar product that should have a similar performance. I am very disappointed in Sandisk for not making this clear in the product descriptions. I have actually lost a bit of faith in Sandisk after this incident.

{"review": "As with any good thumb drive, it takes a little while to write; that's just a fact of life with this type of memory. Because this one is so big, it takes about 40 minutes to write 16 GB of data to it from my new iMac. But the read speed is much faster at about 7 minutes for that much data. Smaller files transfer in a snap. The price is phenomenal at $23. I can't get that kind of price anywhere locally, including Sam's and Costco. That price point is more typical of the 8GB size at this time. It comes with security software that will work on a Mac or PC. I have a Mac so I can only speak about that. The software leaves a lot to be desired, but it works. I'm not a professional hacker, but I didn't see any easy way to view any files unless the software decrypts it first. It just operates a bit quirky in that I can put files in the drive with drag and drop, but cannot remove files in the same way. There are four ways to add files, but not to remove. NOTE: use of the security software is optional, and you can store normal and secure files on the same drive, which is great.

{"review": "This is the fifth e-ink Kindle reader that I've bought. My wife and I were early adopters of Kindle, and when we buy a new Kindle, the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line. I loved the original Paperwhite, with its small size, touch screen, front-lighting, and virtual keyboard. The all-new Paperwhite is a definite step up, and for me, it was worth the move, but others will have to decide for themselves. If you read a lot, and you don't already have one of the newer e-ink Kindles, it's definitely worth upgrading to the Paperwhite. If you have the original Paperwhite, the upgrade is well worth considering. Although I've only had the new Paperwhite a few hours, I'm already glad I upgraded. Here's a summary of my initial impressions of the new Paperwhite. SIZE: It's the same size as the original Paperwhite - 6.7\"x4.6\"x0.36\". The weight has been reduced slightly from 7.8 ounces to 7.3 ounces. The Paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand, which is how I usually read. The really good news is that if you have a case for the original Paperwhite, it will also fit the new one (thank you, Amazon). If you buy a case, I highly recommend that the case include the magnetic AutoWake function. It's much easier to turn the Kindle on and off without fumbling for the small power switch. LIGHTING: The front-lighting is noticeably improved over the original Paperwhite, which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the LED lights were located. (It didn't bother me, but some readers were annoyed by that.) I couldn't see any shadows in the new Paperwhite, where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform. With the Paperwhite's front lighting, you'll never need a clip-on light, even in total darkness. TOUCH SCREEN: The text appears a bit crisper with more contrast, even though the 212 ppi resolution is the same as the original Paperwhite (but it's much better than the 169 ppi of the earlier Kindles). Unlike backlit tablets and phones, which wash out badly in sunlight, the Paperwhite is very readable in any lighting condition from total darkness to bright sunshine, simply by adjusting the lighting level. The touch screen's responsiveness has been noticeably improved. Swiping the page with a finger or touching the left or right sides of a page turns it immediately. With my old Paperwhite, I sometimes had to swipe or touch twice. The new Paperwhite is definitely more responsive with faster-turning pages. BATTERY: According to Amazon, \"A single charge can last up to eight weeks (based on a half hour of reading per day with wireless off and the light setting at ten).\" Certainly not all Kindle readers fit this profile. As much as I read, and because I download so many books that I leave the wireless turned on, I routinely recharge it about once every week or so just to bring the battery to full charge. In any case, the battery life is several times that of backlit tablets and phones. With the high-speed chargers that are available now, battery life shouldn't be an issue with the new Paperwhite. OTHER COMMENTS: As a touch screen e-book reader, the Paperwhite has no physical I/O, aside from a power button and a recharging/data port. Unlike earlier e-ink Kindles, there's no provision for audio output, so you won't be reading audiobooks on the Paperwhite. NEW OR IMPROVED FEATURES: The X-Ray feature from the original Paperwhite has been retained and improved to be more context sensitive. The new in-line footnotes that can be read without losing your place will make footnoted nonfiction books a more enjoyable experience, as will be the new navigation feature that lets you scroll forward and backward without leaving the page you're on. I haven't had a chance to play around with those very much, but what I've seen so far looks very promising. The new Paperwhite does not include FreeTime for kids or the built-in version of Goodreads (now owned by Amazon), but these features are expected to be added in a software update by the end of this year. SPECIAL OFFERS: It's $20 more if you want to eliminate the special offers. You can do this at the time you buy the Paperwhite, or you can do it later online. Honestly, you get used to the special offers very quickly, and in my opinion, it's not worth the money to do away with them. Also, they don't interfere with your reading - you only see them when you turn on the Kindle, and after swiping the screen with your finger, they go away. THE VERDICT: The new Paperwhite is the state-of-the-art e-ink ebook reader. With improved screen contrast for better readability, a more sensitive touch screen with faster page turns, and some new or improved features that enhance the reading experience, it was worth upgrading from the original Paperwhite. Note: I also have a Kindle Fire HD 7\", which I use for web browsing, emails, apps, and music, but for most reading, I prefer the Paperwhite, unless a book has color photos or illustrations. ---------------------------------------- Update (10-31-2013): After using the new Paperwhite for a month, the added feature that I love the most is the Page Flip. When you're on a page, swipe up from the bottom, and a slightly smaller pop-up of the page appears. The pop-up has page turn arrows to go back or go forward in the book (you can also just swipe the pop-up page). When you're ready to return to your original page, press the \"X\" in the upper right corner of the pop-up, and the pop-up page goes away. It's as close as you can get to holding your finger between pages in a printed book while you flip pages. This is really a helpful feature.", "id": 2642129011}

{"review": "Length:: 8:38 Mins I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text. I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them. I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before. With 221 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) this screen provides a 768 by 1024 pixel screen that just makes the old Kindle Keyboard look old fashioned. Technology certainly does move quickly on. My favorite time to read is the last two hours of the evening before bedtime. Unfortunately that is the worst time to use a non-lit screen e-Reader. I went to using the Kindle Fire and the iPad 3. Unfortunately I noticed eyestrain that limited my reading time and I did not get the full enjoyment of spending my time reading. This new soft lit screen is unobtrusive and for me my eyes do not get tired of reading like they do on the Kindle Fire and on the iPad. After reading on the other backlit tablets I feel like I have that 1000 yard stare with dry and tired eyes. This lighting effect is softer and easier to read without the tired eyes and blurry vision. I am glad that I finally made the investment to get an updated Kindle Paperwhite. There are 8 font sizes and I recently learned from one of the brilliant people who added a comment to this review that you can pinch and zoom on the Kindle Paperwhite to expand the font size or decrease it like you do on a powerful tablet, this is a great feature. There are 6 different font styles and they are Baskerville, Futura, Caecilia, Helvetica, Caecilia Condensed and Palatino. The fonts have been fine tuned to offer additional sharpness and clarity which is great for reducing eyestrain and fatigue. I love the new dictionary feature that creates a Vocabulary Builder which is a list of the words that you looked up and you can review the list and use flashcards to enhance your vocabulary and reading skills. I thought that I would have trouble making the transition from the Kindle Keyboard to the New Kindle Paperwhite but it was a breeze. I think that using a touch screen and using finger swipes to turn pages and emulated keyboards like on the Kindle Fire and iPad made it a natural transition to this new Kindle. There is a minor learning curve of learning where to touch the screen but the changeover was fast and easy. The capacitive touch response of the screen is very nice. It makes the New Paperwhite respond quickly to finger touches, menu changes and page turns and the faster CPU helps there also. What I like about the Kindle Paperwhite is that it is a dedicated e-Reader and it combines the best features of the Kindle e-ink and the iPad/Kindle Fire. * Ultra lightweight at 7.3 ounces and easily held for hours with one hand. I love the size and weight as it is comfortable to hold for long periods of time and you don't find yourself laying down the Paperwhite like I would be doing with my iPad 3. * Lit screen for reading in poorly lighted areas like the iPad and Kindle Fire but without the eyestrain. The lighting level is adjustable. * High clarity of the text and contrast for easy reading * Fast charging time in 4 hours * Ability to be easily read in the sunlight with no screen glare. * WIFI connectability * Battery life of 28 hours (of reading time) depending on the WIFI usage and screen brightness used. * Touch screen control * Easy page turning and access to the onboard dictionary, access to Wikipedia and X-Ray. * Easy to access menu and setup was a breeze * 25% faster response for loading books and page turning thanks to a faster microprocessor. * Small, thin and highly portable * Able to carry 1,100 books * My favorite feature is the adjustable text size and font style! * Custom tuned fonts add clarity and crispness to the quality of the displayed text * Since I review a lot of books I love to highlight sections and text as well as take notes on the screen. * Translation of foreign language that is used in the book * Web surfing is possible but still slower than a good tablet. Who cares, this is my portable ebook reader with 1,100 books in it. I have other devices to browse the web and read my email. * I like the rubberized feel of the back and it is similar to my Kindle Fire. It makes the Kindle Paperwhite easy to grip and hold with one hand and just have it lay in the palm of my hand without a case. This tablet gives me the best reading conditions in the daytime and also in the night. It has a lot of great features but I wanted to post a review that provides a strong comparison between the new Kindle Paperwhite, the Kindle Keyboard and the Kindle Fire when used as purely a reading device. -------------------------------------Kindle Paperwhite---------Kindle Keyboard----------Kindle Fire original Screen size: -------------------- 6 inch------------------------6 inch E Ink Pearl----------7 inch color LCD Resolution: ---------------------768x1024-------------------600x800---------------------600x1024 Weight: --------------------------7.3 ounces------------------8.7 ounces-------------------14.6 ounces Overall Size: --------------------6.7\"x4.6\"x0.36\"-----------7.5\"x4.8\"x0.34\"-------------7.5\"x4.7\"x0.45\" Battery life in hours of reading: 28 hours----------------28 hours----------------------8 hours Charging Time: -----------------4 hours----------------------4 hours------------------------4 hours Eyestrain: ---none under all reading conditions---yes in poor light----------yes due to backlighting Memory: -------------------------2 GIG -------------------------4 GIG ---------------------------8 GIG Number of books: -------------1,100--------------------------3,500----------------------------6,000 Included charger: --------------No---------------------------Yes--------------------------------Yes WIFI Connectability: ----------Fast and easy--------------Fast and easy-------------------Fast and easy Speakers: ------------------------No----------------------------Yes--------------------------------Yes Other considerations: * No distraction from email * No distractions from text messages * No distractions from phone calls.

{"review": "Length:: 8:38 Mins I have loved and used my Kindle Keyboard for years now but I missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark. I purchased a Kindle Fire and I also use an iPad 3 but for ease of reading on my eyes I prefer the Kindle Keyboard. I wanted to get a Kindle Paperwhite e-Reader but I held off until this new generation was released before I spent my money. I got this because I wanted to reduce my eyestrain from reading in the evening and I just love this new tablet. It offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced eyestrain and high clarity and contrast of the text. I have added a video of the Kindle Paperwhite compared to a Kindle Keyboard and a Kindle Fire. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I will try to answer them. I love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear. I use the Kindle because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books. Reading was my number one hobby my entire life and I just loved it. The Kindle has brought back that reading experience and now with the crisper text and lit screen I can enjoy my reading in every type of environment. I laid my Kindle Keyboard and the New Kindle Paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new Paperwhite. The new lighting system and screen clarity is where this Paperwhite design really is outstanding. With better contrast, lighting and custom designed fonts, the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e-Reader before.

{"review": "This review is for the second generation Kindle Paperwhite. Like all kindle e-readers before it, this is a great product. However, I am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year's model. For this review, I focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new Paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year's model. Also, I found somethings misrepresented or confusing in the advertising, so I will try to clear them up. HARDWARE Design - The Kindle white has a nice look and shape. It fits well and is easy to hold in one hand. It's fairly light, so it doesn't tire the hands too much. I can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands. Its design is very similar to the previous Paperwhite - almost identical. The height and width are the same, the buttons are in the same location, and although this version is slightly lighter, it is not noticeable. Display - Although not a huge improvement from last year's model, the display is one of the best features of the Paperwhite. Like most e-readers, the Paperwhite uses digital ink technology. This model employs a more advanced version. In addition, the lighting has been upgraded, so among other things, it is more evenly lit. Together, they make for incredible viewing. In my opinion, it's one of the best digital ink e-reader display on the market. I really enjoy reading on it, text look very sharp and crisp, with little to no eye strain. Processor - The Paperwhite has an upgraded processor, which means smoother page turns and navigation. I am able to open books, flip pages, and navigate menus fairly quickly. There is barely any lag as I flip through many pages at a time. Also, the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all. Although, when turning to a new page, I can still see remnants in the empty spaces caused by the text from the previous page, but not sure how much of this is because of processor speed. This is a nice upgrade from the previous Paperwhite. Touchscreen - The touchscreen is good, it works as it should. The screen responds to the items I am trying to select. Rarely does it misinterpret my selection. Battery Life - I haven't really had a chance to test this out, but Amazon quotes battery life to be eight weeks. Note, these are under very specific conditions - \"based on a half hour of reading per day with wireless off and the light setting at 10.\" So let's do the math, 8 weeks x 7 days in a week = 56 days * .5 hours/day = 28 hour battery life. This is with wireless off and light at 10. Turn on wireless or raise the light setting, and performance drops. So battery life is not as huge of a jump from other devices as Amazon would lead us to believe. SOFTWARE In addition to hardware, the Paperwhite has some software upgrades. Initially they seem like separate and unique improvements. However, I found much of it to revolve around a single enhancement with many features added to it. That enhancement is the picture-in-picture screen. With this popup like screen, you are able to see information and navigate menus without leaving the current page you are reading. The device has leveraged the popup in several ways. Word Lookup - One of the things I love about e-readers over traditional books is the ability to look up definitions of words in real-time, right from the device. No need to pull out a separate dictionary or thesaurus. Although most e-readers have this feature, I like the enhancement made for the new Paperwhite. It allows me to lookup a word on dictionary, x-ray, and Wikipedia on a single interface. For me this is great. I am a knowledge seeker, and when I come across something I want to know more about, whether it is a definition of a word or getting background information about a term, I can do that. Page Flip - The page flip function is probably the best improvement of the upgraded software, it rocks! With it, I can skim forward or backward, like flipping back and forth between the pages of a real book. It's not quite like a real book, but in some respects a little better. It works by opening a popup window on top of the current page I am on. From this popup screen, I can scroll back and forth by page or by chapter. Since I am skimming on the popup screen, I never lose my place. I find it really handy for referencing a chart or visual aid on another page, or if I want go back to review or reread a section I didn't fully understand. When I am done, I can close out of the popup window to go back to the original page. Foot Note - Nothing huge, but worth noting. In previous kindle versions, looking at a footnote meant navigating away from the page you are reading. With the addition of the popup function, footnotes instead open up in a separate screen. Not a huge enhancement, unless you are reading footnote heavy books, but then again how many of us really are? Vocabulary Builder - Not something useful to me, but others might enjoy. The Paperwhite will collect all the words you look up definitions for and archive them so you can view them later. This can be used as a way to build your vocabulary. It has built in support to review the words like a flashcard, which will display both the definition of the word and its context. Again, not something for me, but I can see it being useful for the geek at heart. Free Time - Don't have kids so can't give an elaborate opinion on this. All I know is that it is a parental control feature similar to what is on the Kindle Fire HD. It puts restrictions on what your kids can do and see when using the device. Goodreads - For those who don't know, Goodreads is essentially a social network for readers, where people can review books and exchange recommendations. Amazon recently purchased Goodreads, allowing the company to now also become a social networking service. It will be interesting how Amazon moves forward with this, or what will happen now that Goodreads is no longer independent. VERSIONS Currently, the Paperwhite comes in two versions, WiFi Only and 3G. Wifi Only - The wifi version costs $119. Wifi doesn't mean you can browse the web on it. It simply means you can purchase and download books without connecting it to a computer. 3G - This version cost $189. It isn't like buying a 3G Tablet, where you will have to pay for a monthly data plan. Again, you can't use it to surf the internet. The benefit of 3G on this device is that it allows you to purchase books independent of a wifi connection, but you need to be in an area with 3G cellular coverage. So if you're on the actual Amazon, Amazon.com can't deliver to you. This version is not slated to be released until early November. Ads - Ads are shown on the home screen on both versions when the screen goes to sleep or you power the device on. For an additional $20, you can opt out of the ads. I was pretty vocal with my dislike of ads in my review of the Kindle Fire HD last year. I think ads are tasteless and cheapen the experience, and don't belong here. But like for any corporation, money is king. ECOSYSTEM When you buy an e-reader, you are not just getting a physical product, you are getting amenities of that brand's ecosystem. For example, if you buy a Barnes and Noble Nook, you can read books for free in their stores. If you buy a kindle, you get features like X-ray, which as I said I really like. Personally, I think Amazon has one of the better eco-systems for books. They have a library not available anywhere else, if you are a Prime member, you can download books for free, and now with the acquisition of Goodreads, they have really changed the game. I mentioned last year in the Fire HD review that Amazon has always been at the forefront of the book buying and reading experience. I still feel that way. I think they are always innovating in this area. Some of the innovations aren't the best, but I give them credit for trying. If we ever fall into a police state society where books are banned, like in Ray Bradbury's novel Farenhiet 451, something tells me Amazon will be the revolutionary force using some advanced form of whispersycn technology to make sure books still reach people...probably not, but it gives you an idea of how dedicated they are to books. SO, SHOUD YOU BUY? If you own last year's Paperwhite - I don't think it is worth the upgrade. I don't really see this as a second generation Paperwhite device. In terms of design and hardware, it is nearly unchanged. Yes pages turn faster, but your reading experience is not going to change that much. The useful enhancements are in the software, but if you are interested in those, Amazon will likely have updates available for the older kindles. A true upgrade would have been to add a stylus so you can take and save handwritten notes or maybe offer a model with a bigger screen. If you do trade up though, one benefit is that your old cases will still fit. If you own a Kindle Fire, Fire HD, or another Tablet - and are thinking about getting a more portable reader, I recommend it. I personally like reading more on an e-reader than a tablet. In sunlight, there is significantly less glare, and since you don't have a bright screen shining in your face, reading doesn't feel as intense. Also, e-readers are smaller and lighter so it is easier to carry them with me to the park or beach. Another benefit is that battery life on e-readers are considerably longer, not eight weeks as Amazon has listed, but enough so I am not charging it daily. If you own another kindle model - I believe it is worth the upgrade. You'll get a bigger, better, and brighter screen, a faster device, touch screen, and more features in terms of software. If you don't own any e-readers and this will be your first purchase, or if you're just waking out of a coma and the concept of e-readers is new, you can't go wrong with the new Paperwhite. Good combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem. Hope this review has been helpful and given you useful information for your decision. One thing I didn't include is a comparison to other brands. Personally, and I hate to say this, but I don't see a future for many of them. What Apple did to Virgin Music and other record stores, Amazon is on the verge of doing to bookstores and retailers.", "id": 2642129011}

I mentioned last year in the Fire HD review that Amazon has always been at the forefront of the book buying and reading experience. I still feel that way. I think they are always innovating in this area. Some of the innovations aren't the best, but I give them credit for trying. If we ever fall into a police state society where books are banned, like in Ray Bradbury's novel Farenhiet 451, something tells me Amazon will be the revolutionary force using some advanced form of whispersycn technology to make sure books still reach people...probably not, but it gives you an idea of how dedicated they are to books. SO, SHOUD YOU BUY? If you own last year's Paperwhite - I don't think it is worth the upgrade. I don't really see this as a second generation Paperwhite device. In terms of design and hardware, it is nearly unchanged. Yes pages turn faster, but your reading experience is not going to change that much. The useful enhancements are in the software, but if you are interested in those, Amazon will likely have updates available for the older kindles. A true upgrade would have been to add a stylus so you can take and save handwritten notes or maybe offer a model with a bigger screen. If you do trade up though, one benefit is that your old cases will still fit. If you own a Kindle Fire, Fire HD, or another Tablet - and are thinking about getting a more portable reader, I recommend it. I personally like reading more on an e-reader than a tablet. In sunlight, there is significantly less glare, and since you don't have a bright screen shining in your face, reading doesn't feel as intense. Also, e-readers are smaller and lighter so it is easier to carry them with me to the park or beach. Another benefit is that battery life on e-readers are considerably longer, not eight weeks as Amazon has listed, but enough so I am not charging it daily. If you own another kindle model - I believe it is worth the upgrade. You'll get a bigger, better, and brighter screen, a faster device, touch screen, and more features in terms of software. If you don't own any e-readers and this will be your first purchase, or if you're just waking out of a coma and the concept of e-readers is new, you can't go wrong with the new Paperwhite. Good combination of hardware, software, and ecosystem. Hope this review has been helpful and given you useful information for your decision. One thing I didn't include is a comparison to other brands. Personally, and I hate to say this, but I don't see a future for many of them. What Apple did to Virgin Music and other record stores, Amazon is on the verge of doing to bookstores and retailers.", "id": 2102313011}
{"review": "I am writing this review from the perspective of being a long-time Kindle user vs. someone brand new to the Kindle experience. As a point of reference, I have owned and used each model of the e-Ink Kindles and Kindle Fires. From an overall standpoint, and considering everything you get (compact e-Reader, touch screen, lighting system), the Paperwhite is a very good e-Reader. Similar to the first-generation Paperwhite, I am impressed at how much smaller these e-Readers can become as compared to a \"regular\" Kindle or my Kindle Keyboard yet still not feel like you're losing anything from a \"feels like a book\" experience. To address the reading experience, I compared the current book I was reading side-by-side with the first generation Paperwhite as I wasn't sure what to expect with the display. The text on the screen is sharper than the first generation with a better contrast: the whites are whiter and the blacks are blacker. Why is that important? It means the text is more crisp while you are reading which is always a good thing (and my aging eyes). Compared to a regular e-Ink Kindle, the text on the screen is much more crisp than any of the other version of an e-Ink Kindle I have used, and just to ensure I wasn't being biased I put the Paperwhite next to a Kindle 3 / Keyboard, a Touch, a \"regular\" Kindle, and a Kindle DX - all on the same page of a book with the covers removed (didn't want the cover to give an optical illusion or anything) - and you can clearly see a better quality in terms of the fonts. Reading in the dark is a good experience with the lighting display in comparison to the other versions of Kindle because you don't need an additional light that can get in the way: it didn't disturb, for example, my wife who likes to watch TV in a dark room; the same is true in comparison to the first-generation Paperwhite. it is also very convenient on a plane ride at night as you are able to see the full page of the text vs. a light attachment only reaching most of the screen: there are no impediments to the reading screen. Reading outside is not a problem, either, as compared to some of the display issues you may have with a Kindle Fire outside. Turning the page backwards and forwards is as simple as a simple tap of the thumb as you hold the device or, if you prefer, a swipe with your finger in either direction. Accessing the menu structure of the Paperwhite is also simple: just touch the top 20-30% of the screen where you can quickly access a keyboard, hit the menu, table of contents, etc. Navigation is a piece of cake. This generation of the Paperwhite is supposed to have a processor that is 25% faster than the first-generation Paperwhite: I can't seem to tell a difference between the two models, as a page turn appears to take just as long - and I didn't notice a delay in the first place. Something new in this model - to me, at least, as I never saw it on the first generation Paperwhite - is a tool called Vocabulary Builder, which is supposed to help you learn new words while you read: words you look up in the Kindle's dictionary are stored in Vocabulary Builder, where you can then view Flashcards or review usage examples for those words. It's not something I see myself personally using, but I imagine my kids will as they are reading about 75% of their school books for reading class or extra credit on their Kindles. WiFi setup was easy, and it took me an extra minute because I typed in the incorrect password to my wireless router. Web surfing speed with the WiFi feature on the Paperwhite is about the same as the other type of e-Ink Kindles and the first generation Paperwhite. Doing a side-by-side test I tried the mobile websites of Fox News and CNN and they popped right up; the usual slow sites were still slower than Christmas (Houston Chronicle newspaper in particular). With the whiter whites and darker darks I mentioned above, the crispness of the web pages - especially pictures - is much improved in this model. Checking email with an e-Ink Kindle via Gmail is a chore with this as well as other versions of e-Ink Kindle, but none of that is really important to me as I have too many device that do that anyway: when I have my Kindle, I usually want to read a book vs. surf the web or check email. Despite what people may say, size matters! In this case, the Paperwhite is not too small and not too large and Amazon appears to have hit the sweet spot. I would highly recommend the Amazon-branded case for it, as it fits snug and firm and automatically puts the unit into sleep mode when you close the cover, and wakes it back up when you open the cover. To see the cover I purchased, click this link: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Leather Cover, Onyx Black (does not fit Kindle or Kindle Touch). About the only negative I have for this unit, if you could even call it a negative, is Amazon continues to be rather cheap and not include a power adapter with the included power cord. True, most people have lots of adapters they can plug the micro-USB cord into, but please make the unit complete and functional fresh out of the box. Despite that statement, for just $119 I think this is a great unit and I enjoy reading with it: the Paperwhite has replaced my beloved Kindle Keyboard for reading! If you boil down all of the whistles and bells, the cost of the unit and the cost of additional items (cover, screen protector), plus the elimination of purchasing an external light for reading at night, I think the Paperwhite is hands down the best e-Ink Kindle readeryou're your money Amazon is offering right now. If you are looking to upgrade your current e-Ink Kindle, or are a first-time Kindle purchaser, I would recommend this model of the Kindle every time.", "id": 2642129011}

This can be a problem if you are somewhere that you really don't want to use Wi-Fi. Personally, I've had this problem in hotel rooms with \"Pay-for-Use\" Wi-Fi. It would seem so simple to just turn off Wi-Fi and use 3G; but it can't be done. Yes, I would buy this Kindle again; but I am disappointed that I cannot select the use of Wi-Fi or 3G.

{"review": "I've always been a person who's adamantly disliked ebooks. I preferred the real thing, the feel of the book, flipping the pages, the smell of the paper and ink. I briefly gave the first generation Nook a try, mostly for the ease of carrying a ton of books with me in college without adding to my already overloaded book bag, but honestly didn't like it at all. Yet after being bombarded with Kindle Paperwhite commercials for the past month, and coming face to face with the device in a Best Buy, I finally decided to give it a look, and after investigating all the features on the Amazon page for it, decided to take the plunge. And I'm seriously glad I did! The device is so small and light, it's really comfortable to hold in pretty much any reading position with one hand or both. I love to read in bed, and I can even balance it on a pillow one handed without having to worry about it slipping out of my hand as I tried to turn pages, and snapping shut to lose my place. When you read thick, monster sized books like I do, this is a real concern! The screen is brilliant, evenly lit across the entire surface, with a gorgeous, no glare finish. I was able to read in bed in complete comfort, in the dark, after my husband had already gone to sleep. The light adjusts from being exceedingly bright to very dim while all still being evenly lit, so I'd imagine anyone would be able to find a setting comfortable for their eyes in various environments. The screen itself is slightly recessed into the black border, so the chances of accidentally turning a page are reduced. The system controls wonderfully. Everything is snappy; the pages flip fast, the browser loads the store quickly. Downloading books really is as quick and simple as advertised. When you first start the device, there's a brief setup to pick your language, set up the WiFi, and link to your amazon account. After that, there's a a brief tutorial showing you the ropes of controlling the system, which I feel that anyone should be able to learn. The ability to change the font size and the font itself is quick and easy to access, but not something I've yet used. From the looks of the settings however, I imagine there would be something to suit everyone's needs. One feature I thought I'd rarely if ever use is the 'Lookup' feature. I hardly ever bother to look up words I don't know when I come across them whilst reading as I can almost always infer their meaning from context. However, when I have a dictionary or Wikipedia article right at my fingertips, there's just no reason not to look them up. It's not necessarily a feature used only for little known words you haven't encountered before; today while reading, I came across a passage involving a tray of food. Besides the tea, cookies, bowl of olives and other things on the tray, there were two items in french. Simply by tapping and holding on the words themselves, I discovered through the dictionary that the items were actually a plate of various cold cuts, and a type of french sausage. Did I need to know exactly what these items were to understand the passage? No. Did it lead to a more detailed image of the scene and a more enjoyable passage? Most definitely! This feature even works on character's names within the text when it's enabled by the publisher, and will bring up a description of the character- very helpful for any books with a large cast of characters. But what really won me over was the ebooks themselves. You can buy pretty much any book in a somewhat less expensive digital format, and Amazon has sales all the time apparently. I've already picked up three full novels from the monthly sale for only $1.99 a piece. Add to that the lending library from Amazon Prime, and being able to check out ebooks from the public library without even having to leave the house, on top of being able to email myself PDF's and other files of my own... It's just fantastic. Plus, with Amazon adding in the 'Kindle Matchbook' feature at some point, I'll be able to buy the print version of books I'll definitely read again and want to own a physical copy of, and still be able to get the digital to read on the go with ease for a significant discount. I can still have my print collection of my favorite author's works grow, while being able to enjoy the ease and convenience of the ebook as well! I've seen a lot complaints about the ads that appear on the lock screen, but I personally don't mind them at all. The ads are for new releases and sale books, which I don't mind seeing anyway- I might want that book, who knows! Besides, it's more interesting then a blank lock screen anyway. You can pay extra to get rid of the ads apparently, but I wouldn't waste the money to do that when the ads are likely to be of interest anyway. The battery for me is not lasting as long as specified, but I'm also not using it in the specified way either. Amazon's advertised battery life is for 8 weeks with airplane mode on, only using a light level of ten, and reading for only 30 minutes a day. My Paperwhite's Battery hit less then half full in about 2-3 days, but I was also reading for hours each day, with the light higher set higher then ten. The battery should be plenty to last you the time of a plane, car, or train trip no problem- and it charges fairly quickly. It's a shame that the Kindle itself doesn't come with a wall outlet adapter for the USB cable, but the Paperwhite uses the same connector that my Galaxy S3 phone uses (which I believe is the same as most phones nowadays) and I should be able to use one of those cables. It's nice to have the option to buy the adapter separately, rather then building one into the price; most people should have plenty of charging cables with wall plugs laying around from their other devices. The Kindle Paperwhite was the perfect ebook storm to make me finally take the plunge and become a dedicated e-reader. The crisp book like display, ease of getting and carrying books with me, being able to read in any light level, perfect size and shape for any reading location or position. It's just... unbelievably good. I love my Kindle far more then I ever thought I would, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Even if you're completely dedicated to your physical bookshelves, give Paperwhite a try- it's worth it.", "id": 2642129011}

{"review": "I have owned many Kindles and various other tablets, and I decided to purchase the New Kindle Paperwhite (2nd Gen.) because I wanted a Kindle with a built-in light. After using it for a couple days, I can't help but compare the new Paperwhite to my old Kindle 3 (AKA Kindle Keyboard). I have to say that the K3 is still by far the best eReader that I have owned. The Paperwhite is a step backwards in my opinion. The new built-in light is fantastic, and was a great addition to the Kindles, but loss of other features makes the Paperwhite less useful than the K3. The Paperwhite has a slightly whiter screen, but the K3 was already very bright and white, so I don't notice any real difference when I am immersed in a book. The weight feels about the same for both, and the Paperwhite is slightly smaller, but not much. The Paperwhite still has a huge bezel around the screen. I really don't think this very slight reduction in size is a big improvement. One big difference is the loss of the physical page turning buttons. The touch screen is nice, and useful, but it was much easier to just squeeze your thumb to change pages rather than having to lift your finger to touch the screen. I know that sounds a little petty, but after reading for several hours it makes a big difference. Another big loss is the text to speech reader, the earphone jack, and speakers. I loved being able to turn on the reader when I was busy cooking food or washing clothes, and then switch back to reading when I was done. I also sometimes have trouble reading difficult text, and the reader was amazing at helping me keep my place and better understand what I was reading. I have become a much better and faster reader by using the text-to-speech reader on my K3. I think this would be an important feature for younger children or people with reading disabilities. This is probably the biggest loss on the Paperwhite. You also lose the ability to listen to Audible audio books on the Paperwhite, so you can just cancel your Audible account after upgrading. The Paperwhite also has much less memory and holds noticeably fewer books, magazines, or PDFs. That might be good because you might save some money by not buying as many books. Jeff Bezos once said that the goal of the Kindle line was to create the best eReader possible. If that is true, then why did Amazon drop so many important and useful features when they introduced the Paperwhite? When I look at the giant step backward, I can't help wonder if Jeff and Amazon are really more interested in squeezing every last dollar out of customers rather than providing the best eReader possible for a reasonable price in exchange. To anyone that currently owns a Kindle 3 or Kindle Keyboard, I would only suggest buying the Paperwhite if you want to have the built-in light. Other than that, there is no real reason to upgrade, and in fact, it is actually a downgrade in my opinion.", "id": 2642129011}

Other than that, there is no real reason to upgrade, and in fact, it is actually a downgrade in my opinion.", "id": 2102313011}
{"review": "*** UPDATED *** I have the Kindle Keyboard, the low end Kindle, Kindle Touch, and Kindle Fire. All excellent devices in their own ways. I purchased the first generation Paperwhite, and I returned it in a matter of a couple of days. I wrote an extensive review, mostly focused on the screen. The screen lighting was a mess, and the light had a blue cast. I could not read on it without eye fatigue within a matter of minutes. Since I read extensively on both my iPad and smartphones, I couldn't understand why this device gave me so much discomfort. So, for me, the original screen was simply a deal killer. The improvements to the screen are the difference to me of a \"keeper\" and a device that I couldn't think of keeping. However, having said that, I was hesitant to purchase another one. Here's my first read on the new device: Screen: This device is much better.... I just read on it in low light with the light at approximately 11, and it's great. Even turned up to 15 or 16, it's readable. The light is whiter, much more even across the screen. There is still some unevenness, but it's not bothersome (there is a brighter \"stripe\" of light at the top of the screen.) Screen Contrast: Play with the light to see how the contrast changes with illumination. You'll see considerable variation. Still, it's too dark to read in a room at the settings Amazon suggests if there is no ambient light in the room, but the contrast is fine with the light set in the middle. Speed: It's very zippy! Quick page turns, quick book opens, responsive screen. New features: I love the ability to browse forward without moving from the current page. Highlighting is simple, and more flexible. You can change the length of the highlight easily by moving the brackets after your initial \"grab\" of all or part of a sentence. After you make the change, you touch \"Highlight\" and it's done. Not so easy on older devices. ** UPDATE** The vocabulary feature is great! Each time you look up a word, it goes into a vocabulary file. You can review the list, and give yourself Flashcard practice. Great way to improve your vocabulary! LOVE IT! Battery Life: I will update this review as I see how this goes. I noticed that after only a few hours of use, that I see a \"tick\" of battery life reduced. However, since it's new, is indexing, and I downloaded 11 books, we'll see how the battery holds up with use. **UPDATE** I've had the device a total of 9 days, haven't used it daily, and I keep wifi off for the most part. The battery will need to be charged soon. FYI. Page Numbers: I will also update this review after more experience on a variety of books. I'm reading a large book, and have the book on a number of devices. All have page numbers, except for the Paperwhite version. Not sure why. The book has been indexed by my device, so I'd expect them to be there. If this proves to be the case, I'll be calling the Paperwhite team in the hopes that this will be fixed in a software update. ****UPDATE**** To access page numbers: open your book. If you see location on the lower left, tap on it. It should switch to page numbers (tap again and you can scroll through other things: time in book and chapter). This will also change your table of contents to page numbers (hit Go To after tapping top of screen to bring up the menu). Weight: Has a slightly hefty hand feel, but not enough to be bothersome. What would I change: Not much, except for two things: Storage: 2G of storage is not enough, in my opinion. However, as my older devices became lower on storage, the device speed ground to a halt. So, this is one way of keeping the device performing. I'm already at 1.25G remaining storage with 11 books downloaded. I'd have paid extra to purchase a 4G option. Audio: I don't care so much about text to speech, but I don't understand the lack of ability to use Audible books on this device (although with 2G of memory, it's obviously not an option at that level). Not being able to use Audible doesn't make sense to me in light of the Whispersync for voice feature that has become so much a part of Amazon's ecosystem. I suppose this drives people to the Kindle Fire, but still.... For the last two reasons, the device doesn't feel like a bargain to me at $119 (it's stripped in some ways, particularly next to a $139 8G Fire), but it is still an excellent device as long as you are clear on what you are getting. A couple of initial tips: I saw some crazy flashing of the screen (may also have impacted the battery) which I later realized may have been the cover images of my archived items loading onto my device. The flashing has stopped, so I expect that was the case. I have a lot of books in my Archive. I found the recommendations at the bottom of my screen took up too much space from my library. I turned them off via \"Settings\".... great that you can do so. Play with light settings until you feel comfortable in different light situations. I expect that you'll be changing the settings, but it's simple to do. I'm glad that Amazon is not taking their focus off pure reading devices. I purchased this mainly to take the load off of my backlit devices (iPad and Fire), since I often found that I was either constantly charging, or couldn't read when I wanted to, since they were plugged in in another room. **** UPDATE 10/25 **** I've been using the device for about a month, and it's great! A pure reading device. I can read for long periods without eye fatigue, indoors or out. It's very easy to navigate back and forth...for example: what to check chapter length? Just tap 'go to' and a drop down will show you the table of contents, including page numbers. It's very responsive. The only lag I've seen is with a game that I downloaded, Slingo. That is sluggish. ***** UPDATE 10/30 I was reading outside near sunset. As it got darker, the device lighting enabled me to continue reading till it was almost dark without touching the lighting settings (and I could have continued reading after dark). Great! ****** UPDATE 11/13 Battery life: seems to be consistent around 9 to 10 days, with light set between 10 - 16 and with wireless off ( except when downloading). Not as good as I expected, but I can live with it. Speed: I have noticed with use, and additional books stored, that the device is becoming more sluggish. If I type my password too quickly, it doesn't take, for example. I need to purposefully input each number, wait for it to show up onscreen, and then put in the next number. Also, with page turns. Not as quick as when I first received the device, but it's still ok. ******** Any questions, comments, things you'd like tested? Please post and I'll be back to you as soon as I'm able. Enjoy! Nice job, Amazon!", "id": 2642129011}

{"review": "Let me start by saying that I am an avid reader and iPad user. I am and always have been extremely loyal to my iPads. In fact, I have two iPads...and iPad mini and an iPad with retina display. Both of my iPads are amazing in their own right and the one with retina display even more so. I used the iPad mini to read because of its convenient size in comparison with my larger iPad. However, reading on them in any kind of daylight is a challenge and not visually comfortable in the least. So I decided to purchase the Kindle Paperwhite. I was initially concerned about the lighting complaints I was reading about on the original Paperwhite so I was undecided. I was thrilled when I learned that Amazon was releasing a new version of their Paperwhite. I ordered it immediately. I AM HOOKED! For reading, there is absolutely no comparison. Even my super retina display iPad doesn't come close. I have started to neglect my poor little iPads and take my Kindle Paperwhite everywhere I go. The resolution is amazing. You can see it crisply and clearly in any type of lighting. You can adjust the screen lighting to your desired brightness. It is light and easy to hold. I have small hands and holding it is not an issue because of how light it is. It can be held so comfortably that I don't even want to put it in a case...even though I know I should protect it. It is absolutely perfect in every way. The lighting is not streaky or blotchy as others have mentioned with their original Paperwhite. It has actually made me want to read more. I have the version with the advertisements and they do not hinder at all while reading. They simply come up on your screen if your Kindle is left dormant and can be made to disappear with a mere flick of your finger. It is amazing and as far as I am concerned...the best e-reader out there!", "id": 2642129011}

{"review": "First of all, the device itself, reading books, the backlight, are all very nice. I previously had a 3rd gen kindle and this one is drastically better and well worth the upgrade if only for the wonderful backlight. There is one big issue and that is with the wifi. Every public wifi service now has some web page or interface that needs to be clicked through in a browser to activate the connection. This kindle works with some major chains that do this, but there are so many airports and other areas with \"free wifi\" that the kindle can't utilize because of the limited browser and it's inability to navigate these activation pages. One example was Charlotte airport, I wanted to purchase a new book for my layover, but their website to enable wifi actually completely froze the kindle and I had to hard-boot it. I rebooted and retried 2-3 times and it bricked the kindle every time. This was not an isolated incident as I have come across hotels and offices with similar issues while owning this device. I would recommend skipping the wifi version of kindle e-readers and just get the 3g, the extra money is well worth not getting stuck at an airport or hotel without something to read.", "id": 2642129011}

{"review": "I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking): First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content). The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review. I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there. WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly. Chromecast: Is very cheap at $35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices. Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay $150-$400+ extra for features that are found in these $100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it!) HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time. Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky. (You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.) Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are. Amazon's Fire TV box Pros: + Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster. + Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example. + Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another $40. The $40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be $25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a \"REAL\" console at $100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them. + Better image quality? I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with \"decent\" quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex. Cons: - It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it. - The interface is more than merely \"cold\". It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use. - The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix. - The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion. - Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned. - No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature. - Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch. - Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information. Overall: This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40% more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value. If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks!) If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance? (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box. I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements. If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 & Fire TV. I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3. I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information! Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them. UPDATE 1: Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points. Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc. I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone. HBO Go: This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it. UPDATE 2: CHANNELS: It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature. NETFLIX APP: Is the \"older\" style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the \"new\" Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3. Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app. AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a \"feature\" they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going. VOICE SEARCH: Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results. OPTICAL OUT: I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box). Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected. VEVO APP: This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me!). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too. REMOTE: I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE! They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first people! I do like that the \"enter\" button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it. MULTITASKING: What multitasking you ask? Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here!) Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist. PLEX APP: Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click). SCREENSAVER: FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch. GAME CHANGING: Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title. I said \"Nothing else is this fast\" to which one commenter said, \"Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changer\" Actually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much $$ into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities. When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct?, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc. People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis). This is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes. I said \"Voice search is amazing.\" and they said \"Not unique, by any means. My xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.\" Find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from Google, Apple or Microsoft. The fact that little old Amazon could out deliver those tech giants is SHOCKING. The fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. There is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost. I said \"Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another $40\" to which they said: \"And stick to basic android games. No thanks. I have a REAL console (or a couple of them) that can play REAL games...\" This isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. It is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. They have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you CAN'T play on that same console. Just imagine all the cheap under $5/free games you can enjoy on your FireTV box. As I said above in my main review, I think Amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but I can understand why they needed to limit their losses. Again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). Every future streaming box will be measured against this one. Tell me how that isn't game changing? Please understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. I am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them. Hopefully this review has been helpful to you.

{"review": "I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking): First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content). The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review. I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there. WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly. Chromecast: Is very cheap at $35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices. Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay $150-$400+ extra for features that are found in these $100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it!) HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time. Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky. (You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.) Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are. Amazon's Fire TV box Pros: + Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster. + Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example. + Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another $40. The $40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be $25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a \"REAL\" console at $100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them. + Better image quality? I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with \"decent\" quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex. Cons: - It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it. - The interface is more than merely \"cold\". It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use. - The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix. - The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion. - Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned. - No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature. - Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch. - Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information. Overall: This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40% more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value. If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks!) If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance? (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box. I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements. If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 & Fire TV. I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3. I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information! Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them. UPDATE 1: Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points. Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc. I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone. HBO Go: This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it. UPDATE 2: CHANNELS: It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature. NETFLIX APP: Is the \"older\" style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the \"new\" Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3. Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app. AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a \"feature\" they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going. VOICE SEARCH: Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results. OPTICAL OUT: I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box). Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected. VEVO APP: This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me!). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too. REMOTE: I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE! They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first people!

Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here!) Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist. PLEX APP: Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see.

It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 & Fire TV. I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3. I will update this review regularly for a while, so check back for more information! Also if you have questions or comments, please feel free to ask them in the comments section. Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them. UPDATE 1: Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points. Regarding comments that I received the item free or are paid by Amazon to write this review, etc. I paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box (grrr). Nothing was provided to me nor was I paid anything to write about this device. I do not work for Amazon, I own my own company. For this item, I am just a customer. In fact, I didn't expect to even purchase a Fire TV prior to it being announced because I figured it would only deal with Amazon's own content which I feel is much weaker than Netflix. In fact, I have talked two different family members into getting Netflix over Amazon's Prime Streaming service in the past month alone. HBO Go: This has been repeated over and over in the comments but HBO Go support for me is not something I am interested in as I do not have cable service anymore nor do I feel that HBO is a better value than Netflix. I would not go without Netflix support at all but I personally think HBO Go is more niche for many people and honestly I bet this device will get that channel before too long. Clearly the HBO Go people seem to be pushing the issue but I know 11 streaming box users and none use HBO Go so while I noted the missing feature above, people still seem to want to beat me up over it. UPDATE 2: CHANNELS: It needs to be said that some channels require cable/satellite subscriptions (to those channels) like HBO Go (not currently on this box), Showtime, ESPN, etc. Even if you have HBO, it does not mean that your provider allows the HBO Go, so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind. I do like the Bloomberg TV (not available on Roku 3) App which actually features a LIVE TV feature. NETFLIX APP: Is the \"older\" style with the tall covers (like VHS boxes) instead of the \"new\" Netflix interface that uses short wide covers (like on Roku 3). Netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the Fire TV box doesn't have it yet. That makes comparing performance harder from Roku 3 to Fire TV. On my ISP provider Comcast (Netflix recently agreed to pay Comcast so they have faster streams to customers) I do not see a HUGE improvement in performance in buffing like you see on other channels. What it does seem to do is start in better quality and/or speed the improvement in quality. My guess is that the Netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware. One positive with the FireTV app is that it plays the entire TV episode BEFORE switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode. I can't tell you how many times I had to click, click, click and click just to see the end of an episode under Roku 3. Also, the FireTV Netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated Roku app. Before going into a TV show, FireTV tells you how many total episodes that Netflix has. On the Roku it shows you the number of seasons instead. I personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference. Another point worth mentioning is that the FireTV Netflix App shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on. That information is missing from the Roku 3 Netflix app. AMAZON PRIME CONTENT: Does not loop--a \"feature\" they should add (and likely will). This means once you get to the end, it just stops instead of keeping going. VOICE SEARCH: Voice search DOES cover some 3rd party content, despite everyone reporting it works on Amazon's content only. I have repeated confirmed it supports the VEVO app and will find music videos in that app. That may mean that other 3rd party apps are covered as well, or certainly might be able to be in the future. If you search for something that has PRIME content and VEVO content, it will default to the option with the most options. To switch to the other, simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or PRIME search results. OPTICAL OUT: I noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my LG TV (via HDMI) and then use an optical out to my receiver (so I never have to change the receiver's settings) so I wasn't excited about this addition to the Fire TV box over my Roku 3 boxes. I stand corrected. I decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this Fire TV box (something that I can not do with Roku 3) and it fixed all random lip-sync issues I have from time to time on the Roku 3 box (and the same with the HDMI output on this box). Now I know this is not a typical setup for many people but I do know that tons of people have lip-sync issues with HDMI connections so being able to bypass the HDMI minefield is much more important than I expected. VEVO APP: This app works better than the Roku 3 app performance wise...one quick example is that some content simply fails on the Roku 3 app--try watching Britney Spears's Work B**CH (don't make fun of me!). Vevo can play this video fine on YouTube and on the Fire TV app but struggles on Roku 3's app. SOME of VEVO's content is also available via VOICE SEARCH too. REMOTE: I do miss the jump back button on the remote that Roku 3 features. It is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn't hear because the phone rang, or someone was talking, you feel lost without it. UPDATE! They did include this feature but hid it abit. You simply double click the reward button to skip back. I haven't seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first people! I do like that the \"enter\" button is back in the center of the directional keys. This is the way it used to be on Roku boxes before someone at Roku decided to move it below the directional keys, so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it. MULTITASKING: What multitasking you ask? Since you haven't seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere, I can understand your confusion but try this: Load a Pandora stream...then click on the HOME button and browse for movies/tv you want to watch. As long as you are in the Home/Amazon Prime content, you can browse WHILE Pandora continues playing. Now Pandora dies when you enter another APP like Netflix but it shows you that Multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features. (Again, this TIP is only found here!) Another update: This tip also works when browsing PLEX content before you play something. So even when utilizing a 3rd party app, it can keep going. When it changes to a new song, a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist. PLEX APP: Compared to the Roku app, PLEX for FireTV is totally different. There are some cool features, like the backgrounds, the screensaver using your photos and the MUCH faster menuing (night and day from Roku 3) but I do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to ONLINE to see. I do miss that clicking the play button doesn't play a clip, instead you select it (click) and then play it (second click). SCREENSAVER: FireTV has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion. I am not saying you can't do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos (and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well.) This functionality covers 3rd party apps like Netflix and Plex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts. This is the sort of thing you see on PCs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch. GAME CHANGING: Many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title. I said \"Nothing else is this fast\" to which one commenter said, \"Nobody cares how fast an streaming box is. That's not a game changer\" Actually using it you will see what I mean. This is the first time a company has put so much $$ into creating a very solidly made hardware device. Like a fast computer (which this basically is), it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities. When AMD created their first processor that competed directly with Intel's higher end processors, it was a game changer, correct?, because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever, lowered pricing, etc. People will look back in 5 years at this moment and say Amazon's FireTV changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made (instead of barely enough processing power to stream, they became able to compete with HTPCs and Mac Minis). This is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes. I said \"Voice search is amazing.\" and they said \"Not unique, by any means. My xbox, ps3, tablets, all have this, and all work amazingly.\" Find one person who owns this that doesn't say this voice search works better than anything from Google, Apple or Microsoft. The fact that little old Amazon could out deliver those tech giants is SHOCKING. The fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to. There is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost. I said \"Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another $40\" to which they said: \"And stick to basic android games. No thanks. I have a REAL console (or a couple of them) that can play REAL games...\" This isn't meant to compete with more expensive game consoles. It is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes, just like tablets/cellphones have brought gaming to millions. They have not replaced gaming consoles (and likely never will) just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you CAN'T play on that same console. Just imagine all the cheap under $5/free games you can enjoy on your FireTV box. As I said above in my main review, I think Amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get peopling playing the games but I can understand why they needed to limit their losses. Again, this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device (and the only one for a streaming video box). Every future streaming box will be measured against this one. Tell me how that isn't game changing? Please understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone. I am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a decently balanced opinion of them. Hopefully this review has been helpful to you. If so, please let me know by clicking the button below. Remember you don't have to agree with everything I said to think it was helpful! ;)", "id": 8946435011}
{"review": "I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking): First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content). The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review. I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there. WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly. Chromecast: Is very cheap at $35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices. Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes. Normally you pay $150-$400+ extra for features that are found in these $100 boxes. I have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting. The advantage is that you can use your TV remote to access the content. (and that is about it!) HTPC: These are desktop computers or Mac Minis or Android Sticks that you load software on to stream video to your TV. These can add content that no normal streaming box can access, without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn't mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time. Video Game Consoles: Xbox/Playstations can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams. The downside is the cost (unless you already have one) and the interfaces. These consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky. (You can use other options but frankly they aren't worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do.) Now this Amazon product has changed everything. It might not be the box for you...but honestly there is a good chance that it SHOULD BE. This is a brand new category for Amazon and they got a lot right, but there are a few shortcomings (at least at launch) as well so read all of this to see what those are. Amazon's Fire TV box Pros: + Nothing else is this fast. While Roku 3 impressed the world, this raises the bar dramatically. With a quad core processor and 4 times the memory of any other streaming product, it speeds through menus, boots quicker, starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times. The best way I can explain it, you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is THAT much faster. + Voice search is amazing. It really works. Less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time saver and makes you wonder why this wasn't done before but it is only for Amazon content and VEVO (music videos) (at least for now). You can not use the voice search with Netflix for example. + Ready for gaming, well at least once you spend another $40. The $40 gaming controller feels a bit pricy for this type of gaming and really should be $25 or less in my opinion. That being said, this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a VERY limited selection on Roku 3 but it is not a \"REAL\" console at $100 and honestly shouldn't be compared to them. + Better image quality? I know you are thinking I am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally (in different apps) the video is slightly sharper and clearer. We are using the exact same tv, settings, even the same HDMI cable that we used with the Roku 3 until we switched it for the Fire TV box. We have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with Roku 3. Now I don't know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something. As image quality is a huge deal for most folks (and normally us streamers have to suffer with \"decent\" quality) this is certainly worth noting. So far we have noticed this under Netflix, VEVO and Plex. Cons: - It lacks soul. Yes, soul. The Fire TV box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance--cold, fast, efficient. Unlike Roku 3 where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of TiVo--it feels warmer, more inviting. Everything about this box is business like, including the interface and the lack of options to change it. - The interface is more than merely \"cold\". It is simply less flashy/pretty than the Roku 3 interface. While fast, I am less tempted to wander around like I do on Roku 3. It seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the Roku 3 interface. I will update this more upon extended use. - The voice search only works for Amazon's own content (and VEVO) and not most 3rd party channels like Netflix. - The remote is not ready for gaming use, compared to the Roku 3 remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements/motion. - Another feature about the remote I don't care for is the use of Bluetooth instead of WIFI. Roku used to use Bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphone jack in the remote. It will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned. - No headphone jack function like Roku 3. Now to be honest, if you use that on the Roku 3 it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature. - Missing some popular channels at launch. There is no HBO-Go, no M-Go and no Vudu. In addition, the channel count is much less than Roku's at launch. - Channels operate differently on FireTV than the do on Roku 3. See my notes below for more information. Overall: This Fire TV box took so much from other company's products with only a few missing items. They focused on delivering smooth, fast performance with less frills than Roku 3 for the same price. While there are missing channels and features, the biggest failure for me PERSONALLY is the cost of the gaming controller. Without it, this box isn't ready for gaming but adding 40% more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep. Had Amazon included it with every Fire TV box, they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the Roku 3 a poor value. If you do not have any streaming box yet, I would HIGHLY recommend this box over every other product on the market right now. I don't make this endorsement lightly. I currently own 3 Roku 3 boxes because I liked them so much, until I used this Fire TV box. This box means Roku will have to really work on improving their product for Roku 4 or they will lose the high end market. (An update, my wife officially asked to replace the Roku 3 boxes with more Fire TV boxes tonight. Yes, these things are that good folks!) If you have a Roku 3 box, really look at the missing channels and features--are they something you could give up for faster performance? (Also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps.) If the answer is yes, then grab one of these and try it. If no, wait to see if Amazon adds features/channels. At the very least, consider an Fire TV box for your next box. I do not personally recommend Apple TV as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions. Apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements. If you are on a budget and have an Android based tablet, consider Chromecast. It is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to Roku 3 & Fire TV. I am giving this box a 4.8 rating, compared to a 4.2 for Roku 3.

Either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them. UPDATE 1: Based on comments, I wanted to add a few points.

It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to \"rent\" from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a ~$1 or more. So happy with this purchase!", "id": 2102313011}
{"review": "Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours. Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple. The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell. Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly. The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote. I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device. Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed. Update 7/21/2014: The latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for Amazon Prime members - addressing most of my original complaints. Now that there is an entire section dedicated to Prime content, it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content. I wouldn't mind seeing more 'categories' to search through, but don't want to diminish the improvement. It's still not possible to search and return only Prime content. I think it should be possible to tell the device (when you search) that you only want returns from what is available for free to Prime members. The new 'Music' option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point. Not sure why it was added, but I hope it grows into a useful feature given the new Prime Music package. I would also like to see some sort of DLNA feature added. As one who rips all content that I buy (blu rays, dvds, cds) to a computer on my Network, I would very much like to be able to stream this material to the FireTV. Adding support for a connected USB device is not a solution for me. I have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material.", "id": 13447451}

{"review": "The Fire TV came well packaged with extremely simple instructions. Plug in the power cable and HDMI cable (not included), put batteries in the remote and that's it. After initial start up there is an update that must be run, but after a few minutes the unit was up and running. Interface is nice looking and easy to use. Voice search worked perfectly...it understood this Kentucky accent instantly. Flipping through the movie choices is super fast (almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two). Netflix is on the home page, but you have to install the app before using it the first time. As I'm typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while I have a movie paused. If you store your photos on Amazon's Cloud you can use your own pictures instead. Picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast. The only thing I see as a con would be how the Prime movies are marked. The placement of the Prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn't as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it's Prime or a movie you would rent/purchase. I figure in the days and weeks ahead Amazon will be listening to customer suggestions (as they usually do) and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better. For me the Amazon Fire TV is a winner. It will definitely be replacing a Directv receiver I was using. Update: After one full day of using Amazon's Fire TV I am more than satisfied with my purchase.If you read reviews like I do make sure to skip over the ones that don't have the Amazon Verified Purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful. These are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession. If you discount those reviews (which make the overall rating less than it should be) you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied. 4-6-14 Update: Added the AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv. The sounds are more richer and louder than ever before. I am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of. I really suggest getting the cable I mentioned above to make your Fire TV experience even better!! 4-8-14 Update: Turned on the device today and went to start up Netflix...all I got was a white screen. Turned the unit off and on, but still a white screen. I uninstalled the Netflix app and reinstalled and it worked again. I don't believe it was a problem on the device itself, but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine. 4-15-14 Update: Had the same white screen issue with Netflix some more. Contacted customer service and reported the issue. He stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps. When you come to Netflix instead of uninstalling click on force stop. This fixed the issue. If I have the problem again he asked that I contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue. I continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the Directv receiver I had connected. I can't recommend the Fire TV enough!! 6-25-14 Update: My Fire TV is still going strong and I am completely happy with it. I have found that I watch TV more so on The Fire than my DirecTV. The one thing I haven't checked (but will sometime) is the USB port. I've got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if I can play a saved movie from the drive using the USB port on The Fire. Finding Amazon content is a breeze using the Voice Search and searching through movies or videos using Netflix and others is fine. Yes, it would be great to be able to use the Voice Search with everything else, but it's not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience. I would imagine Amazon will eventually include their Voice Search on any third party application as time allows. Even after using it all this time I'm still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device. For me Amazon just gets better and better. 8-4-14 Update: I had movies saved to an external hard drive and I plugged it into the USB port on the Amazon Fire, unfortunately, it doesn't work. It basically did nothing. It made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any USB plugged in.

{"review": "Length:: 0:45 Mins NOTE ON VIDEO: I've made this to illustrate the current works of Fire TV's voice search feature. It appears to be limited to Amazon content, at least for videos. I believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music. I am searching for House of Cards, Season 2, a Netflix original. I am a Netflix subscriber so I would expect the Netflix listing to be displayed but Fire TV only returns the show's Season 1 available for purchase at Amazon and does does not list Netflix at all. As a Netflix subscriber, I could watch both seasons 1 and 2 for free but, according to Fire TV's search, Season 2 doesn't exist and I'd have to pay $2.99 per episode if I wanted to watch Season 1. See how Roku's search (second half of video) correctly shows that Season 1 is available from Netflix, Amazon, MGo and Vudu and that I can gety get Season 2 from Netflix.

It's up to everyone to weigh Amazon's faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns Amazon-only content vs. Roku's ability to find content across the channels/services it carries. _________________________________________________________________ REVIEW BEGINS HERE: As a current/former owner and user of streamers such as Roku 3, Roku Stick and Google's Chromecast and also streaming/gaming platforms such as PS3/PS4 and Xbox 360/One, I believe I can do a fair assessment on what Amazon's Fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives. I rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and, hopefully, my assessment of Amazon's Fire TV may help others decide whether this is what they need or want. BROAD ASSESSMENT The Fire TV will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace. From what I've experienced so far, due to its tight integration with the Fire HDX tablets and Amazon's own Instant Video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the Amazon tablet and already subscribes to Amazon's Prime. Its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non-hard-core gamers. For everybody else, depending on one's specific needs and expectations, the Fire TV may or may not be the 'right' streamer to buy. As one who purchased Amazon's original Kindle Fire on day one and went through several generations of Amazon's Kindle reader I expect that Amazon's streamer will also evolve or grow overtime. Amazon will listen to 'us' and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting, 'new and improved', more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants. Until then, I would say that the current Fire TV is a competent, Amazon-content-biased (through search) streamer with gaming capabilities, lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search (offset by its currently favoring Amazon's service) and the user interface in general. Parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching. If all you want is streaming and don't care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don't need. CONTENT The Fire TV offers most but not all mainstream services and I suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and I am sure that more services will be added in time. However, at this time Amazon's selection pales when compared to Roku's 1000+ wildly diverse channels but the Rokus have been around for a while. All mainstream services now on Fire TV are also available on Roku, PS3/4, Xbox 360/One and many on Google's Chromecast. Fire TV attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content, allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from Amazon's Instant Video. By comparison, Rokus offer text based cross-service search with results returned from most 'big' providers. Amazon's attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so, time will tell. The soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish Amazon's product from the competition once they are implemented. INNOVATION Amazon's great innovative, revolutionary, disruptive device was the Kindle reader and the enhanced Kindle Paperwhite. I suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as 'forests' instead of 'recyclable material' these days because of the Kindle. Amazon's Fire tablets are nice but they are... tablets. The Fire TV streamer/gaming device falls probably under 'okay' or 'interesting' streamers and 'not too bad' gaming platforms. The quad-core CPU is also nice but, whether I'm streaming on a significantly more powerful PS4 or a tiny one-core CPU Chromecast, the video/audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable. I assume that the reason for a more powerful CPU is the game-playing part. The lack of large permanent storage (HDD) implies that, as a gaming platform, the Fire TV will allow for mostly small to medium-size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage. Again, a feature that may not be suitable for those whose ISPs charge by the Megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers. Game playing on the Fire TV works but those used with big console's lag-free controllers that 'rumble', talk back and sense motion may not view the Fire TV as a serious gaming platform. I would say that Amazon's streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation. It's a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that's still Okay. VALUE There's very little that Amazon's Fire TV does that other platforms don't do. - The PS3/4 and the Xbox 360/One are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good streamers and multimedia machines. Only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more. - The Chromecast and the Rokus are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and PCs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet. They are also somewhat more difficult to setup. - Small streamers such as the Roku Stick and the Chromecast are very portable as they fit into one's shirt pocket. Amazon's Fire TV could be carried around at least in theory but it's not as easy to move around. - Roku is still the leader of 'content' but Amazon's selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time. - The Fire TV costs a lot more than a Roku or a Chromecast but, even if a gaming controller is added, is still less than a PS3 or an Xbox 360 - Voice search as implemented on Fire TV at the time I am writing this (restricted to Amazon and Vevo) is in effect hiding content from other services, potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at Amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a 'free' stream. WHO NEEDS IT? Anyone who already has one or more Roku, Chromecast or Xbox, Playstation in their homes probably don't need one at this time. Unless they are tightly integrated into Amazon's ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching. Those who are looking for their first streamer should consider - Fire TV's ease of use (beats the Chromecast but it's probably on par with Roku and the Xbox/Playstations) - Amazon's great user support - Roku's enormous channels selection - Playstation and Xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms (if you don't mind paying up to $60 for newly released games) - Amazon's attempt to keep their users confined to Amazon's own hardware platforms and content streams vs. Roku's and Chromecast relative openness - Fire TV's split gaming/streaming personality (Jack of 2 trades) vs. Roku's and Chromecast focus on streaming - Price, of course It's not an easy decision to make. I would be very happy with the Fire TV if it was the first streamer device in the house. With so many stream-capable and game-playing boxes/sticks already operating and doing well, I like Amazon's Fire TV for being a well designed, capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but I also like and I've been using the Rokus for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the Chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my Chrome browser to the TV. I hope that Amazon's search will soon expand to cover non-Amazon services or it won't be a useful tool. I may not have the the Fire TV attached to the big TV in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful Kindle and Amazon Prime user asked for it in her room.", "id": 13447451}

{"review": "Edit: July 2014 The Fire TV boX has gotten even better for me. On of the things I really wanted was the ability to stream my music. Amazon has added a feature where you can stream you music the sits on the amazon cloud drive.

This makss the device even more useful to me than before. --------------- So when I moved into my house last year, I made the obligatory call to TWC for internet and cable TV. The \"bundled me\" into a 200 dollar per month bill which includes 30 Mbs internet (in theory -- in reality, I never see that), telephone (which I don't use because I have Verizon home phone connect, and TV with whole house DVR, all the premium channels (which I never watch), HDTV etc. After losing my job and having Time Warner get extremely nasty because I chose to spend what 200 bucks I had left on food and gas rather than paying them, AND the fact that they have THE WORST SERVICE (I had to swap out my box and waited in line for over an hour just to swap it out and then when the new box didn't work, wait yet another hour in line to get a 3rd box), I have decided NO MORE TWC. Amazon Fire TV is the corner stone of my plan to cut the cord. I've only had it for awhile tonight but I am so far blown away. The voice recognition works flawlessly (ok -- 1400 reviewers here... raise your hand if your first search term was \"Porn\" -- yeah, I'm immature) Regardless of what inappropriate word or attempts to baffle the system my teenage son and I threw at it, it recognized EVERYTHING (with the exception of his Latin -- ok, Amazon fire doesn't recognize Latin ... but neither do I!) Went to the YouTube app because that is a part of my plan to ditch TWC -- could I play shows that were on YouTube that I currently watch via cable. Check. Paired with my computer (a mac), I just searched for the video that I want, hit play on the computer and it automatically is displayed on my TV. I've only had it unboxed for 1 hour so haven't tried Netflix or Hulu etc yet but one of the key activities I do a lot of is watching VOD from Amazon and it is SOOOOO much easier to do it using this device that via my BluRay player. Picture quality (even of standard def YouTube videos is nearly as good as cable). The next step of my plan to ditch TWC is getting Fiber Optic DSL installed. Once that has occurred, I will be going from a 200 dollar per month monopoly to 55 bucks per month plus whatever I choose to spend on renting movies etc on demand. AND, I never have to wait in line for hours to swap out hardware that I'm \"renting\" from the cable company...

Then would you stay?\" ME: \"No... if you could provide the same level of service for 40 bucks less than you have been for the last year, why didn't you just do it then rather than making me pay over 40 bucks a month more than I needed to?\" HIM: \"What if I bumped up your internet bandwidth to the next tier for free?\" ME: \"Because I'm not even getting the advertised speed as it is\") Sorry, TWC -- you are no longer a monopoly.

Pros: + User interface and underlying hardware is fast + Form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek + Plays games fairly well, especially for such a small box + Quality of Amazon videos is very good + Voice search works quite well + The device came pre-configured for my Amazon account. I just plugged it in, updated the software, and away I went Cons: - First and foremost, there is STILL no way to search for only free movies on Prime. - Amazon touts it's 40,000 Prime movies available, but good luck finding them. There is no categorization by genre. You are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies, or using the search function, which almost never returns any Prime movies - Voice search works only on Amazon content. You cannot use this to search within Netflix, for example - The Amazon FireTV box only comes with 8GB of memory for game and app storage, which is completely inadequate. There are games available for download that consume almost 2GB for ONE GAME. Good luck downloading a 1.76GB game, like the racing game featured in the list of top games. Clearly, Amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content. In the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device, it even offers you a 30 day Prime membership for free to try it out. However, Amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content. It's clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free Prime content only. This is my biggest beef with Amazon, by far. I want a Netflix-like experience, where my Prime content is sorted by genre, and I can search for free movies only. Now, if you want to pay for video rentals, by all means buy this device, because it works really well. If you want it to access your Prime content only, stick to the Roku box you probably already have, because it works just as good. UPDATE: I called customer service, and talked to a guy about how I can search for and access my 40,000 Prime movies. Well....YOU CAN'T!!!! According to him, I can only find the Prime movies on the two lists on FireTV that say \"Recently added to Prime\" and \"Top Prime Movies\". Those lists are 73 items, and 150 items, respectively. THERE IS NO WAY TO SEARCH OR BROWSE FREE PRIME CONTENT ONLY. The guy I talked to said this was a very common request for people. OF COURSE IT IS.

{"review": "Length:: 9:34 Mins Feel Free to check out My unboxing and overview of the Fire TV! **UPDATE 1: Quick update about surround sound** The Fire Box Seems to default to Stereo, you need to go into settings and turn on \"Dolby Digital Plus.\" This can be found under the settings heading, under the far right setting box, then under Audio, you have to choose whether it will be Optical or HDMI. This should solve the no surround sound issues... **UPDATE 2: (5/21/14)** Ok, I've been using the box for a while now, I really like it but I have to admit App development is a ton slower than I'd hoped, the library is growing but not by much yet. A few new games come over and a few streaming apps, but no DLNA apps to speak of yet. This is one of the things I consider to be the weakest point of the Fire TV so far almost 2 months in and no other local media options than plex yet...... I am not a vine member (Those folks do excellent reviews, I'm just not that lucky to be Vine yet), nor am I speaking to something I don't own, By that I mean that I paid for it myself and here is my Experience so Far: Is it the best thing ever? No... Is it the worst thing ever? Nope, Not by a long shot... In fact, it's up with the top streaming boxes when you take into account future app development... It's a very good device, comparable to a Roku in most ways, some better some worse (Once apps start getting ported we'll see what happens) but there is plenty of room to make a \"FireTV 2\" much better in the future... So here's my review: Overall the packaging came in perfect order, it was easy to open, and nothing was missing. Setup was simple, It took a few minutes thanks to a large initial update to download, but otherwise just as easy as setting up a kindle fire. Pros: Android Based (which means many apps coming and the potential to root and gain more features Ability to use Apps (Not just having to rely on what's preloaded like to many older TV boxes and Bluray players) Accurate voice search - This one surprised me, It actually worked, Way better than Xbox Voice Commands or Siri, and Better than S Voice... Bluetooth remote (for some this is a con, but I don't want another Wifi device jamming my crowded signal Read on to see why I think this) It's not flashy - Matte Colors and no crazy lights Quick to load - Just 28 seconds from Plug in to ready to stream (My Roku 3 takes 78 Seconds to do the same) Feels heavy - for the size it really has good heft (Doesn't feel cheap) Only 1 white light on front, It is a bit bright but not a deal breaker Does Dolby Digital sound Out (DTS, 5.1 Etc) Via Optical or HDMI Netflix In HD (Some android based players couldn't do this) Cons: Need to purchase separate gaming remote No Headphone jack in remote Low on apps to start with No Native DLNA Support (Hopefully Apps will fix that soon) No AC wireless band it has 5Ghz N but not AC Case can pick up fingerprints, but they remove easily Immediate update after first plug in is big, Almost 900MB so it may take a while The power brick is bigger than I was hoping for, if you have a crowded power strip it might be an issue Plex is the only local media app available so far. Voice Search for media only works on Amazon Prime Videos, It will give you options to watch on netflix or Hulu if you go in, but if you want your personal network media you have to go into your app (Plex is the only one currently available) and search manually (Voice search kicks you back out to Amazon Video if you try it. Full Disclosure here I run 2 full HTPC's and a Roku XD and Roku 3 in my house, so my expectations of how this will end up working are very high. To beat out my other devices it has to Play local media (From my HTPC Server), have better functioning Apps than my Roku and be easier to navigate than my HTPC setups are. It also needs to stream flawlessly and with as little buffering as possible (Netflix, Amazon Video, hulu, Etc.) So does it do this? So Close! But not quite... It is faster to stream than my Roku and HTPC when coming from internet sources, and it's faster to play local media (Using the Plex App) But, right now Apps are not yet ported over, for me one of the most important ones is Mediabrowser 3, which powers my main HTPC setups and feeds local media to my Rokus, but Plex works fine, just without parental controls which I want... As far as lack of apps I'm not concerned with this as being android based it is simple for a dev to port them over and given that this will sell excellent regardless of the reviews here there will be thousands of apps coming in the next few weeks/months... My neighborhood is crowded with Wifi signals which makes interference a huge issue for me, the Roku 3 uses \"Direct Wifi\" to connect it's remote, which means that there is another device that puts out a signal to interfere with your other ones, plus it uses the same channel as your router so you can't even move channels to avoid the extra interference. It may not be much in most cases but in an uber crowded locale like mine it is a definite negative, the FireTV's Bluetooth doesn't seem to cause any wifi interference... Voice Search, I was pleasantly surprised on this, it does in fact work, that being said in the middle of an action scene in 7.1 surround you will be hard pressed to make it hear you, but when navigating the main screens using voice search go me to every move or TV show I tried (Except, Ironically, since they use it as an example, Downton Abbey, It couldn't find \"Downtown Alley\" LOL!) Roku VS FireTV: Roku has the edge currently with more/better apps, but this may not be the case in the near future when newer/better apps come out, But for pure speed the FireTV blows the Roku away, I'm streaming a movie from Netflix or local media before the Roku (XD or 3) has finished booting... (When both are unplugged and plugged in at the same time) HTPC VS FireTV: HTPC has the Edge, but that's only because we are comparing a Core i7 PC with an Android based device, So honestly there is little competition, BUT The FireTV has Amazon instant Video as an App, On Windows 7 there is no Amazon \"App\" you can use plus a Hulu App which is no longer supported on PC, so the FireTV wins int hat aspect, but in overall functionality the FireTV isn't a PC and therefore could never really compete, but who wants to has a full PC hooked to every TV in the house? Final thoughts: If you have a Roku XD or 3, you will not get much immediate bump other than speed by upgrading to the FireTV. If you have an older Roku or a WDTV or similar box you will see a noticeable benefit in upgrading to this device. APP Reviews: Plex - The only option for local network content as of this review, Costs 99 Cents, But works well, assuming you can put it on your PC or NAS... Youtube - Works well, easy to link to your personal account Hulu - Easy, Simple, Just like the Kindle app Netflix - Does HD and Surround sound also supports Profiles!

{"review": "Length:: 9:34 Mins Feel Free to check out My unboxing and overview of the Fire TV! **UPDATE 1: Quick update about surround sound** The Fire Box Seems to default to Stereo, you need to go into settings and turn on \"Dolby Digital Plus.\" This can be found under the settings heading, under the far right setting box, then under Audio, you have to choose whether it will be Optical or HDMI. This should solve the no surround sound issues... **UPDATE 2: (5/21/14)** Ok, I've been using the box for a while now, I really like it but I have to admit App development is a ton slower than I'd hoped, the library is growing but not by much yet. A few new games come over and a few streaming apps, but no DLNA apps to speak of yet. This is one of the things I consider to be the weakest point of the Fire TV so far almost 2 months in and no other local media options than plex yet...... I am not a vine member (Those folks do excellent reviews, I'm just not that lucky to be Vine yet), nor am I speaking to something I don't own, By that I mean that I paid for it myself and here is my Experience so Far: Is it the best thing ever? No... Is it the worst thing ever? Nope, Not by a long shot... In fact, it's up with the top streaming boxes when you take into account future app development... It's a very good device, comparable to a Roku in most ways, some better some worse (Once apps start getting ported we'll see what happens) but there is plenty of room to make a \"FireTV 2\" much better in the future... So here's my review: Overall the packaging came in perfect order, it was easy to open, and nothing was missing. Setup was simple, It took a few minutes thanks to a large initial update to download, but otherwise just as easy as setting up a kindle fire. Pros: Android Based (which means many apps coming and the potential to root and gain more features Ability to use Apps (Not just having to rely on what's preloaded like to many older TV boxes and Bluray players) Accurate voice search - This one surprised me, It actually worked, Way better than Xbox Voice Commands or Siri, and Better than S Voice... Bluetooth remote (for some this is a con, but I don't want another Wifi device jamming my crowded signal Read on to see why I think this) It's not flashy - Matte Colors and no crazy lights Quick to load - Just 28 seconds from Plug in to ready to stream (My Roku 3 takes 78 Seconds to do the same) Feels heavy - for the size it really has good heft (Doesn't feel cheap) Only 1 white light on front, It is a bit bright but not a deal breaker Does Dolby Digital sound Out (DTS, 5.1 Etc) Via Optical or HDMI Netflix In HD (Some android based players couldn't do this) Cons: Need to purchase separate gaming remote No Headphone jack in remote Low on apps to start with No Native DLNA Support (Hopefully Apps will fix that soon) No AC wireless band it has 5Ghz N but not AC Case can pick up fingerprints, but they remove easily Immediate update after first plug in is big, Almost 900MB so it may take a while The power brick is bigger than I was hoping for, if you have a crowded power strip it might be an issue Plex is the only local media app available so far. Voice Search for media only works on Amazon Prime Videos, It will give you options to watch on netflix or Hulu if you go in, but if you want your personal network media you have to go into your app (Plex is the only one currently available) and search manually (Voice search kicks you back out to Amazon Video if you try it. Full Disclosure here I run 2 full HTPC's and a Roku XD and Roku 3 in my house, so my expectations of how this will end up working are very high. To beat out my other devices it has to Play local media (From my HTPC Server), have better functioning Apps than my Roku and be easier to navigate than my HTPC setups are. It also needs to stream flawlessly and with as little buffering as possible (Netflix, Amazon Video, hulu, Etc.) So does it do this? So Close! But not quite... It is faster to stream than my Roku and HTPC when coming from internet sources, and it's faster to play local media (Using the Plex App) But, right now Apps are not yet ported over, for me one of the most important ones is Mediabrowser 3, which powers my main HTPC setups and feeds local media to my Rokus, but Plex works fine, just without parental controls which I want... As far as lack of apps I'm not concerned with this as being android based it is simple for a dev to port them over and given that this will sell excellent regardless of the reviews here there will be thousands of apps coming in the next few weeks/months... My neighborhood is crowded with Wifi signals which makes interference a huge issue for me, the Roku 3 uses \"Direct Wifi\" to connect it's remote, which means that there is another device that puts out a signal to interfere with your other ones, plus it uses the same channel as your router so you can't even move channels to avoid the extra interference. It may not be much in most cases but in an uber crowded locale like mine it is a definite negative, the FireTV's Bluetooth doesn't seem to cause any wifi interference... Voice Search, I was pleasantly surprised on this, it does in fact work, that being said in the middle of an action scene in 7.1 surround you will be hard pressed to make it hear you, but when navigating the main screens using voice search go me to every move or TV show I tried (Except, Ironically, since they use it as an example, Downton Abbey, It couldn't find \"Downtown Alley\" LOL!) Roku VS FireTV: Roku has the edge currently with more/better apps, but this may not be the case in the near future when newer/better apps come out, But for pure speed the FireTV blows the Roku away, I'm streaming a movie from Netflix or local media before the Roku (XD or 3) has finished booting... (When both are unplugged and plugged in at the same time) HTPC VS FireTV: HTPC has the Edge, but that's only because we are comparing a Core i7 PC with an Android based device, So honestly there is little competition, BUT The FireTV has Amazon instant Video as an App, On Windows 7 there is no Amazon \"App\" you can use plus a Hulu App which is no longer supported on PC, so the FireTV wins int hat aspect, but in overall functionality the FireTV isn't a PC and therefore could never really compete, but who wants to has a full PC hooked to every TV in the house? Final thoughts: If you have a Roku XD or 3, you will not get much immediate bump other than speed by upgrading to the FireTV. If you have an older Roku or a WDTV or similar box you will see a noticeable benefit in upgrading to this device. APP Reviews: Plex - The only option for local network content as of this review, Costs 99 Cents, But works well, assuming you can put it on your PC or NAS... Youtube - Works well, easy to link to your personal account Hulu - Easy, Simple, Just like the Kindle app Netflix - Does HD and Surround sound also supports Profiles! Pandora - Works as it should, Easy to navigate Amazon Instant Video - Not exactly an app in the traditional sense, It provides content when you go under the various categories on the home screen...

{"review": "After having the FireTV for about a month now, I can confidently recommend this product for most people. Versus the current generation Apple TV, ChromeCast and Roku offerings, the FireTV is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. It's a device I have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents & my (geeky) friends. Best things about the FireTV: - It is fast - unlike the Roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - Has Amazon Prime Video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. Lots of great content from Comedy Central and newer movies versus Netflix. - An AppStore with apps & games you actually want - Plex & Showtime AnyTime are the big difference makers IMO. - If you have local video files on your network, Plex is the way to go. - Voice search Worst things about the FireTV (which really aren't that bad): - Annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - Larger power adapter versus Apple TV (Yes the little things count) - No HBOGO until late 2014 - Going to be a problem from the folks looking for their Game of Thrones fix this spring** - No chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet** If you don't need HBOGO right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. You won't regret it. ** See below for ways around this If you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you. Before the FireTV, I had 3 Apple Tv 2's in my house that I used to access HBOGO, Hulu+, Netflix & my local media through the infuse application. I had tried Roku's, ChromeCast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the Apple TV worked best for me. While this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... Which led me to trying the FireTV. Because the FireTV is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. The steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your FireTV. You may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. Any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work OK. (The following links provide the best directions I have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises!) How to sideload applications to the FireTV: 1. The first step in loading android apps is getting ADB set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb 2. After that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html 3. If you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great GUI application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2736740 Once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the FireTV, I recommend: 1. Installing MXPlayer to allow .MKV & .AVI video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download 2. If your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using ESFileExplorer to navigate to & play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/ 3. AirReceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. Please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. This is a paid app, buy @ play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softmedia.receiver 4. HBOGO android app can be installed and works rather well. It does require a mouse to navigate. 5. XBMC - If you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. Download via xbmc.org For the cord cutters out there, I've tried installing Aereo & Slingbox with mixed results. Slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok. Using the mouse I was able to accept the terms & conditions and input my user info. Unfortunately it doesn't load the video stream. Other folks have had success apparently, so it may be just me. Aereo side loads & opens fine but I couldn't sign up for a trial as I am 1 town over from being in their current market area. I will update this review if I get any further with either. There are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit.com/r/firetv folks - docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uD_6cesLVtHwsoWDE9jlKsV9FtlUbQ3KvDQp6N9gbHE/edit#gid=1337307432 This list includes information on emulators & roms which I didn't include in this review due to their dubious legality.", "id": 13447451}

Versus the current generation Apple TV, ChromeCast and Roku offerings, the FireTV is the best value due to it's access to a wide variety of content, build quality and advanced features. It's a device I have recommended to my (almost-elderly) parents & my (geeky) friends. Best things about the FireTV: - It is fast - unlike the Roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product - Has Amazon Prime Video access- if you have prime membership, this is the best accessory you can buy. Lots of great content from Comedy Central and newer movies versus Netflix. - An AppStore with apps & games you actually want - Plex & Showtime AnyTime are the big difference makers IMO. - If you have local video files on your network, Plex is the way to go. - Voice search Worst things about the FireTV (which really aren't that bad): - Annoying/long intro video upon the first time you boot up - Larger power adapter versus Apple TV (Yes the little things count) - No HBOGO until late 2014 - Going to be a problem from the folks looking for their Game of Thrones fix this spring** - No chromecast/airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet** If you don't need HBOGO right now and don't have a bunch of apple products, stop reading this right now and buy this device. You won't regret it. ** See below for ways around this If you are an advanced user and/or are on the fence this next section is for you. Before the FireTV, I had 3 Apple Tv 2's in my house that I used to access HBOGO, Hulu+, Netflix & my local media through the infuse application. I had tried Roku's, ChromeCast and other media boxes/home theater pc's and the Apple TV worked best for me. While this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks - lack of 1080p video, limited app selection, no games, etc.... Which led me to trying the FireTV. Because the FireTV is based on android, android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine. The steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your FireTV. You may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy - you'll need them to get a few things running. Any old usb keyboard/mouse you have lying around should work OK. (The following links provide the best directions I have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too, but no promises!) How to sideload applications to the FireTV: 1. The first step in loading android apps is getting ADB set up on your machine can be done by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/connecting-adb 2. After that, you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications, also by following amazon's directions - developer.amazon.com/sdk/asb/app-install.html 3. If you aren't comfortable with working with the command line, and are running windows, you can try this great GUI application to automatically side load applications. - forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2736740 Once you are able to send android apps (.apk) files to the FireTV, I recommend: 1. Installing MXPlayer to allow .MKV & .AVI video file playback: sites.google.com/site/mxvpen/download 2. If your network drive/computer doesn't support plex, try using ESFileExplorer to navigate to & play back video files - appsapk.com/es-file-explorer/ 3. AirReceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an appletv. Please note this only supports unencrypted video feeds. This is a paid app, buy @ play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.softmedia.receiver 4. HBOGO android app can be installed and works rather well. It does require a mouse to navigate. 5. XBMC - If you know what this, you will want it and yes it works. Download via xbmc.org For the cord cutters out there, I've tried installing Aereo & Slingbox with mixed results. Slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok. Using the mouse I was able to accept the terms & conditions and input my user info. Unfortunately it doesn't load the video stream. Other folks have had success apparently, so it may be just me. Aereo side loads & opens fine but I couldn't sign up for a trial as I am 1 town over from being in their current market area. I will update this review if I get any further with either.

{"review": "Final update: April 23rd. Starter cartridge finally says it's run completely out (though it still seems to print). That's a total of about 200 pages since I first got a message. The 3-times-Go printout shows a total of 730 pages - roughly what the starter cartridge is supposed to have, and I've now installed the hi-capacity cartridge ----- first update Update. It's now April 11th. I've printed at least another 100 pages and things are still going well. But I've discovered another feature. In addition to the 7-times-Go (described below), there's a 3-times-Go that will print a three page report showing everything you ever wanted to know about your printer, including the amount of toner actually left. (Note that I have a Brother HL-2270DW. The cartridge also fits other machines that may have a different way of getting the same info.) ----- original post Like others I started getting a 'toner-low' message after maybe 450 or so pages. In looking for a way to trick the printer, I read the manual(!). It said to press the Go button seven times in a row to clear the toner-low lockout, and that once that was cleared the cartridge would continue to print until the toner was actually gone. Worked like a charm. I'll update this when the thing actually runs completely out. Understanding this, the way they do it makes sense: really early warning that you should order another cartridge - and a lockout that you can't ignore, keeping you from having a really bad day in the future.", "id": 229180}

{"review": "I converted to a Brother monochrome laser printer a few months ago after years of frustration with another brand's all-in-one printer that consumed huge amounts of color ink even though I printed everything in black and white. The toner cartridge that came with the Brother laser unit ran out quickly, as I was warned, and it took a while to figure out how to replace the cartridge the first time around but now it's easy. I've got the printer set for 300 dpi (and for text instead of graphics) to maximize my yield. Like others, I started to get a \"low toner\" warning around 1500 copies and if it weren't for seeing other Amazon reviews for other Brother cartridges, I might have changed the cartridge shortly after getting the first warning. Having read the other reviews, however, I removed the existing cartridge, shook it a bit to assure the remaining toner was well distributed, ran the \"carona wire\" back and forth a couple of times and returned the printer to regular use. So far, I've printed over 1200 additional pages since the first warning and everything is still printing fine, with no lines or other problems that come when the toner actually is low. I'm watching to see how much longer the old cartridge will work, but wow, the other reviewers definitely helped by warning of this problem. It's something Brother ought to correct. By the way, I didn't put tape over the holes as others have suggested since I don't want any complications from that, although may do so the next time around. As an additional note, unless Amazon has fixed the problem, ignore some of their drop down menus when selecting the right cartridge for the right Brother unit. They say the TN 450 isn't correct for a Brother HL2270DW when in fact it is.", "id": 229180}

{"review": "I love nuts and dark chocolate, so for me this was a no brainer. These aren't big enough for a meal replacement for me personally, but for some dieting or trying to do whats right and eat a breakfast in a hurry these are a great option. If you still eating those chewy granola bars, don't you think it time for an adult bar? The taste on this is great as you get the crunch from the nuts, the sweet and smooth from the chocolate, and sweets favorite companion salty. The only negative thing I could say is these do cost a good bit, but in my opinion it is worth it. Pros: -Natural ingredients -Minimal sugar -Great taste -Healthy fat, protein and fiber Con: -Cost -Not filling enough for a meal replacement. Overall five stars as it is a great product and I will continue to use it as a morning snack.", "id": 7090289011}
{"review": "Kind bars are exceptional, but this is the very best of the Kind bar offerings. The sea salt and dark chocolate mix makes it a delicious mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. And best of all it's gluten free, all natural and low sodium. A good choice all around.", "id": 7090289011}
{"review": "The offer said, Free Sample of Kind Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar, 1.4 Ounce, so I clicked on it, wondering if it was truly a freebie. It wasn't but I ordered a couple of them anyway. More on this \"free sample\" offer later, but how good are they? Subjective Taste Test: Perhaps this is a little unfair as I've tested the KIND Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar before. Bought a couple of them at a local store some time ago and found that they were a good snack alternative to my regular Clif Bar Energy Bars when out cycling. And followers of his show will already know that Dr. Oz, recommended KIND and keeps some in his briefcase at all times. As far as taste goes, these are good, nice and chewy with a decent nut flavor, and the dark chocolate is not sickeningly sweet as one will find with some products. I have a thing for sea salt, and the combination of that with the nuts and dark chocolate works... and they don't leave a bad artificial aftertaste. Nutrition Stats: Checked the KIND site and found the following ingredients were listed for this product: Mixed nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts), chicory root fiber, honey, palm kernel oil, sugar, crisp rice, cocoa powder, non GMO glucose, sea salt, soy lecithin, milk powder, vanilla extract.

But they weren't free, so I figured that I had just missed some special deal. They were being sold by Amazon LLC for $1.49 each at the time, with free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members, and since I've tried them before, picked up a couple of them. Now I see that the original Amazon deal is gone, and has been replaced by a third party offer. At the time of this review, they are being sold for \"$1.59 + $5.95 Est. shipping\" and available at an external website. That comes to $7.54 per bar. So much for the \"free sample\" being offered here. This deal reminded me of something else. Do you remember Vince Shlomi, also known as the \"ShamWow Guy\" and the one in the Slap Chop infomercials that we used to see? Television's fastest talker used his double entendre signature line \"You're gonna love my nuts!\" so often that people bought the product... often to their dismay. I like the KIND bars as noted above, but with the deal being currently offered here, it's reminiscent of that one from the \"ShamWow Guy\" a bit too much. There is another deal here on Amazon for KIND Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, 12-Count Bars which is far better; just do the math, as it comes out quite reasonably if you want a dozen. They have been endorsed by Al Roker, Dr. Oz and other nutrition folks, but luckily we don't hear them saying \"You're gonna love my nuts\" on their television segments. 9/23/2012", "id": 7090289011}

{"review": "KIND has been a positive influence on the snack industry, offering a plethora of healthy options for those looking for a quick, easy snack bar. I have tried nearly every flavor of the KIND Nut Bar line, and am a huge fan of almost every one. Always looking to expand my options, I was eager to try a KIND Healthy Grains Granola Bar, in the Dark Chocolate Chunk flavor. Here are my impressions: TEXTURE: About what one would expect with a blend of grains: crunchy, but a little too crumbly. As I opened the package, pieces were falling out and breaking off, so I was unable to eat it as a fully intact bar. SERVING SIZE: Each bar is 35g, which isn't enough to really quell big cravings, thus not a meal replacement, but will certainly satisfy the need for a small snack. TASTE: Surprisingly bland, especially compared to KIND nut bars, whose flavors are rich, bold and very rewarding. The Dark Chocolate Chunk was lost in the mix of grains, and for a bar that contains 9g of sugar, there was not a lot of sweetness. NUTRITIONAL PROFILE: KIND, as noted above, does a great job of offering products with much healthier nutritional profiles than the vast majority of snack bars. The Healthy Grains bars are gluten-free, low-sodium, and relatively low-fat, but a little higher in sugar than I'd prefer. They are also a little too low in protein, so perhaps adding a nut butter (almond butter?) as a binding agent would be a great way to increase the protein, while making the bars less crumbly at the same time. But with only 150 calories overall, an excellent choice for a mid-afternoon snack. Serving Size: 35g Calories: 150 Fat Calories: 40 Total Fat: 4.5g (7%) Saturated Fat: 2g (10%) Trans Fat: 0g Cholesterol: 0mg Sodium: 65mg (3%) Total Carb: 25g (8%) Dietary Fiber: 3g (12%) Sugars: 9g Protein: 3g INGREDIENTS: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, millet, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, quinoa), tapioca syrup, evaporated cane juice, honey, Non GMO canola oil, coconut, chocolate liquor, sugar, brown rice syrup, molasses, gum acacia, sea salt, vanilla extract, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, Natural Vitamin E. PACKAGING: Each bar is packaged individually for easy, convenient on-the-go snacking. COST: This is probably the biggest plus for KIND Healthy Grains, as the price per bar comes out to less than $1.00 OVERALL: If you're looking to indulge in something low-calorie, that's easy and will satisfy the sweet-tooth of most, you certainly can't go wrong with a KIND Healthy Grains Granola Bar. Are there better/more satisfying alternatives? Sure, but for the cost and nutritional profile you're getting here, KIND easily ranks among the best choices.", "id": 6524625011}

{"review": "I have bought these bars at my local grocery and really enjoyed them, so I added them to my subscribe and save here to save a few dollars. Unfortunately, this is the second month in a row I've received \"off\" boxes. By that I mean something in the bars has turned or gone bad, completely ruining the flavor of the bar rendering it inedible. The first box I received like that was the peanut butter and dark chocolate flavor. 2 of the 3 boxes were fine, but the last box was awful! I double checked the expiration date (it was well before), so I chalked it up to a bad box and ordered another type (oats and honey) to try out. Same deal. One of the boxes was fine, but the other two boxes were both terrible. I don't know what the offending ingredient is, or if the problems are occurring through Amazon or Kind, but either way I'm not wasting my money on a product where I have to cross my fingers and hope I get a \"good box\".

{"review": "I like to have a sweet mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack, but with Type 2 diabetes, I have to watch my carbohydrate intake. My diabetes counselor recommends that I limit snacks to 20 grams of carbohydrates. My usual sweet snack is a Fiber One 90-calorie Chocolate Fudge Brownie with 90 calories, 18g carbohydrates, and 3g dietary fiber. The KIND Granola Bar has 150 calories, 25g carbohydrates, and 3g dietary fiber. So the carbs are over my limit, but not by too much. What about the taste? I tried the Dark Chocolate Chunk bar, and I enjoyed the taste very much. The chocolate chunks imparted a mild but pleasant chocolaty taste and the mixed grains gave a chewiness that made the bar last longer. Nutritionally, the KIND bar isn't too bad health-wise, and being gluten-free is a big selling point for many people. There are no trans fats, and there's a respectable amount of protein and fiber. Overall, the KIND bars are a pretty good snack for most people, although diabetics need to consider the carbohydrate content.", "id": 6524625011}

{"review": "I wanted to try out this product for the \"skin/hair care\" side of it, though this product is \"pure\" enough that a little in my soup or skillet creates a nice nutty aroma and mild taste - really good in this coconut curry soup I eat. That said, I brought the jar into my bathroom to keep it there instead of for cooking (I'll purchase another one for the kitchen). The one negative I have with this product for skin is that it's so thick and hard, I really have to dig in there to get a bit; however, once it's in the palm of my hand, the warmth of my skin melts it quite quickly. It can feel a little heavy and greasy at first, and the scent of coconut makes me think of cooking and not \"beauty product;\" but I mixed it with a little of my regular hand/body lotion and that was the ticket - it smoothed on my skin quite nicely and created a kind of \"sheen\" like those starlets have on their skin as they walk the red carpet with an insipid grin. Mixing it toned down the coconut scent, too. I did smooth it on my face, straight, and it did absorb quickly, and the scent of coconuts wasn't so strong after a few minutes. I have slightly sensitive skin with a little rosacea and the product didn't break me out or irritate my skin. But! The best \"beauty\" use I had from this product that SOLD me, is what it did to my hair! One morning I smoothed the coconut oil on my hair, paying particular attention to the ends. I threw my hair up in a ponytail and left the coconut oil in for at least an hour and a half. I rinsed it out with very warm water and then I shampooed twice. When I stepped out of the shower, I realized I was going to be late for an appointment. I quickly combed my hair, dressed, jumped into my car, and let the opened windows dry my hair, every so often shaking it out and combing through with my fingers -- I couldn't believe it! by time I reached my appt 35 minutes away, my hair was soft and smooth - even with the wind hitting it - no blow-dryer - no brushing it out - when I returned from the appt - again the windows open blowing my hair all over creation, I brushed my hair and it was so soft and shiny and smooth. That sold me -- if I don't use this product for anything else, it's worth it for how it made my hair look and feel! UPDATE! - I bought another container of this to use in the kitchen - omg! If you saute shrimp in it, you not only have the aroma of coconut, but the shrimp taste incredible! I also fry or scramble eggs with it - mmmmmm - this stuff is amazing.", "id": 16320351}
{"review": "Length:: 0:37 Mins I use organic coconut oil on a regular basis whenever I want to sautée vegetables. I have on hand another brand of organic coconut oil, but was very surprised when I opened the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil and smelled it. Even though most of the claims of the coconut oil are quite similar (not quite) the aroma of this oil was stronger, much the way I remember it when I was a youngster. Viva Labs has gone all out on their certifications and one I usually don't see is the non-GMO Project verification and certification. This is a real plus in my book and could possibly account in part for the aroma. The coconut oil originates in the Philippines as does most of the organic coconut oil I'm seeing on the shelves now. Mind you, some people have fits because it comes in plastic containers, but simply transfer to your container of choice upon arrival. For those who want to know, it is at least BPA free. CERTIFICATIONS: ► CCOF Organic ► Non-GMO verified ► USDA Organic FEATURES: ► Free of pesticides, bleach, hexane, and trans fats ► USDA certified organic and non-GMO ► Unrefined, extra-virgin, cold-pressed ► MCTs for energy and weight management ► Suitable for vegans ► Delicious tropical aroma and taste NOTE: This oil \"may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts\" There are several used for coconut oil from dietary supplementation, cooking, skin, and hair care. The hair care suggestion was very interesting: \"Use as a restorative, all-natural hair mask by massaging 1 tablespoon into dry hair. Let sit for 1 - 2 hours, shampooing thoroughly afterwards.\" I'll probably give it a try at some point, but my preference was to sautée that zucchini, an overabundant crop this year. FYI, coconut oil adds a marvelous taste to veggies and they were awesome. I baked the zucchini to finish cooking. When it's warm, the coconut will liquefy. Not to worry because when it cools down in will solidify again. When it's liquid, I simply use a ladle to scoop some out. Coconut oil has a long shelf life and I've yet to have any go rancid on me. Whatever you decide to use the Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for, I'm sure you'll love it. Remember to transfer it to a glass container if you're so inclined (it's simply not practical to ship in glass). I'm a real fan of coconut oil and the first time I used it, I definitely figured out what all the hype was about. There are a couple of things I really like about the Viva and they are the non-GMO certification and that more aromatic smell that its nearest competitor.

{"review": "I use a lot of extra virgin coconut oil, so much that I usually buy the Nutiva 2-pack of 54-ounce jars. I tried Vitacost's and didn't like it as much as Nutiva, so I've stuck with the Nutiva and really had not planned to switch brands. When I was offered the opportunity to review the Viva Labs product, I agreed but was doubtful I was going to be swayed. Well, let me tell you, when I opened up this coconut oil, I was amazed at the difference. This is an extra virgin coconut oil I could actually imagine myself taking by the tablespoonful, as was recommended by several health books my sister shared with me for people suffering from candida albicans infections. I've used my Nutiva for popping popcorn, cooking, and for skin care, but now I'm thinking I'll just use up the Nutiva for frying and go straight for the Viva Labs version for everything else. There's just no contest. A great use for this coconut oil is as a butter replacement on toast. My Nutiva spreads and melts like one of those margarines that take a long time to melt; the Viva Labs spreads like softened butter and melts like a dream. Price-wise, I've been spending about 47 cents an ounce for the Nutiva when I buy it in the big bulk pack. I was thinking that, at almost 62 cents an ounce for the 15-ounce container, the Viva Labs was more expensive—although I'd have to say it's worth it. But when I went to cost out some of the other Nutiva products, they ran as much per ounce if not more than the Viva Labs product. I'm impressed enough that I'll be switching.", "id": 16320351}

{"review": "Viva Labs' Coconut Oil was offered to me free for review and I loved it! It comes in a plastic jar and can be a liquid or a solid depending on the temperature of your home. When I received it, it was a liquid, so I put a little in a squirt bottle (for the shower - see below), but the next day it was a solid because of the temperature inside my home - I just ran the bottle under some warm water and it quickly liquefied so I could squeeze it out. After receiving my Viva Labs' Coconut Oil, I ventured out onto the web to see what I could use it for and wow! There are loads of different ways to use coconut oil: * Cooking * Baking * Skin Care * Hair Care * Aromatherapy * Kitty Cats (put it on their paws to reduce hairballs and promote a shiny coat) * Google it and I am certain you will find a million ways to use it! So, how did I use it? In the kitchen: I was thinking that it would only be good in dishes that were sweet, but it doesn't have a sweet taste at all. I actually fried an egg with it and I couldn't tell that I didn't use regular oil. Coconut oil has a high smoke point, so frying an egg was totally fool-proof and I did notice that it didn't spatter all over the stove like vegetable oil does and my favorite thing about it was that my kitchen didn't smell like fried food for days - which is one of the main reasons I never fry anything! Shower: I always use baby oil (while my skin is wet) as a moisturizer, so instead of my baby oil, I switched it up and started using the coconut oil. A little bit goes a long way, but it soaks into the skin quite nicely and left me feeling silky smooth with no greasy feeling and it smells delicious! Makeup Remover: I also use baby oil to remove my waterproof mascara, so I used the coconut oil and it worked like a charm! Exfoliator: I also used it as an exfoliator on my hands, feet and body - mix it with a little sugar while you are in the shower. It is an inexpensive way to get rid of that dry and flaky skin and again... leaves you with silky smooth skin. I saw that you could use it as a deep conditioning treatment on your hair - it works there too - I smoothed A LITTLE on my hair and left it overnight and then washed it out in the morning. My hair was nice and shiny and didn't look greasy at all. My hair is super short, but I could imagine that a person who might really notice a difference would be someone with long hair who battles with their hair being dry and or frizzy would really notice a difference. Finally, you can use it as a sexual lubricant - yes, well, you know! It wouldn't be a \"Bookie Nookie\" review if I didn't bring something naughty into it! There is ZERO sugar in coconut oil - which is a common concern when using \"food\" products that are sweet in or around those girly parts (sugar in THAT area can cause a yeast infection o_O). There were no issues with that and definitely reduced the friction and helped things glide quite nicely :-D Viva Labs' Coconut Oil is definitely a product I would use again and I would and have recommended it to my friends. At around 11 bucks for a 16-ounce jar, it's affordable and has a million uses - you have nothing to lose by checking it out. ✳✳ Product provided by Viva Labs for an honest review.", "id": 16320351}

{"review": "Well, the wife and I have been using coconut oil for about a year. I think it was Dr. Mercola who tuned us into investigating and using coconut oil for its many health benefits. You can google for a list of benefits and other reviewers on Amazon have done a pretty good job of outlining most of the benefits so I am not going into all that again. I am a guy and I do not like to put greasy \"stuff\" on my face or hair. So, I do not use it as a moisturizer or in my hair. We use it only for eating. So, that is where I will concentrate my opinions. So, we use coconut oil for its health benefits from eating it, although I have put some on cuts and scratches and found it to be very soothing. It seems to aid healing. I have never gotten an infection from any cut after putting a little coconut oil on it with a bandage and the cuts heal fast. There is a misconception that coconut oil is not good for heart health. This is because it contains a large quantity of saturated fats. In reality, coconut oil is beneficial for the heart. It contains about 50% lauric acid, which helps in actively preventing various heart problems like high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. The saturated fats present in coconut oil are not harmful as you commonly find in vegetable oils. Coconut oil does not lead to increase in LDL levels, and it reduces the incidence of injury and damage to arteries and therefore helps in preventing atherosclerosis. Coconut oil is also good for the immune system. I have read that it strengthens the immune system because it contains antimicrobial lipids, lauric acid, capric acid and caprylic acid which have antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties. According to the Coconut Research Center: \"The vast majority of the fats and oils you eat, whether they are saturated or unsaturated or come from an animal or a plant, are composed of long-chain triglycerides. Probably 98 to 100% of all the fats we eat consist of LCT. Coconut oil is unique because it is composed predominately of MCT. The size of the fatty acid is extremely important because physiological effects of medium-chain fatty acids in coconut oil are distinctly different from the long-chain fatty acids more commonly found in our diet. It's the MCT in coconut oil that make it different from all other fats and for the most part gives it its unique character and healing properties. Almost all of the medium-chain triglycerides used in research, medicine, and food products come from coconut oil.\" \"Have you or someone you know ever been in a serious car accident? I mean serious enough that you had to be rushed to the hospital and spend time in the intensive care unit. Or maybe you've come down with a life-threatening illness. Or perhaps due to age you've been hospitalized to treat some degenerative condition. In any of these situations, whether you lived or died depended on the care you received in the hospital. Often this required you to be fed intravenously or through a tube. In the intensive care unit there would be others, some suffering from complications from genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis or epilepsy and perhaps even premature infants struggling to survive their first few weeks of life. In each of these cases you and these other patients can give some of the credit for your recovery to coconut oil. Yes, in one form or another, coconut oil was part of your treatment.\" \"Regardless of the condition, recovery requires good nutrition. Food scientists have long noted the nutritional benefits of medium-chain triglycerides. MCT from coconut oil are used in hospital formulas to feed the very young, the critically ill, and those who have digestive problems. It makes up a vital part of the solutions fed to patients intravenously or through a tube inserted down the throat. If you were ever given formula as a baby you took advantage of the health-promoting properties of coconut oil. MCT from coconut oil have been added to baby formula for decades.\" \"MCT are easily digested, absorbed, and put to use nourishing the body. Unlike other fats, they put little strain on the digestive system and provide a quick source of energy necessary to promote healing. This is important for patients who are using every ounce of strength they have to overcome serious illness or injury. It's no wonder why MCT are added to infant formulas. Actually, whether you were breast or formula fed as an infant you consumed MCT. Why? Because MCT are not only found in coconut oil but are natural and vital components of human breast milk. MCT are considered essential nutrients for infants as well as for people with serious digestive problems like cystic fibrosis. Like other essential nutrients, you must get them directly from the diet.\" \"One of the first scientifically recognized benefits of MCT is the unique manner in which they are digested and utilized by the body. These fats provide nutritional benefits that can improve overall health of both the sick and the well, the young and the old. Even athletes are now using them to boost performance and control weight. Unfortunately, few foods nowadays contain MCT; the best source is coconut oil. By adding coconut oil to your diet you can literally eat your way to better health.\" So, it is information like this that got us to buying coconut oil and using it for baking/frying. For a newcomer, you will notice the coconut flavor right away when you bake or fry with it. It takes some getting used to. Now that we have been using it for a while, we have gotten to like it. I like to buy the 32-oz size when I buy it in the store because we go through it pretty fast and bigger is better. Most coconut oils taste about the same so we just look for the best buys. Most of the coconut oils I run across say they are organic and virgin. So, it comes down to which we like the taste of best and how expensive it is. I don't always go for cheap - I have to like the taste too. I received a 15-oz. container from Viva Labs free in return for an honest review. I was able to do a side-by-side test of this brand and a couple others I have in the house. What I like about the Viva Labs coconut oil is that it seems to be lighter in the coconut flavor. It is rich and creamy and doesn't have that coconut kick that some of the other brands have. You can still taste the coconut when you fry with it, it just isn't so in-your-face. I use it to fry potatoes for breakfast as that is one of my wife's favorite breakfasts. I also use it in place of butter to make cobblers. I make a cobbler topping by mixing oats, brown sugar and coconut oil until the mix is in small crumbs and then put it on top of the fruit filling - cherries, apples, peaches, etc. The coconut flavor actually adds a lot to a cobbler. You can use it for pie crust instead of lard/crisco. Coconut oil is expensive no matter what the source. The 32-oz container I usually buy at the store runs me $35 which is over a dollar an ounce. That makes this 15-oz container from Viva Labs at under $10 a good buy. So, we have been using coconut oil for about a year now. I used to have at least one bad cold a year, an ear infection at least once a year, and usually a case of the flu or similar every year. I don't know if it is the coconut oil, but this is the first time I can remember going a whole year without ever being sick. Not a cold, not a sniffle, no sore throat, nothing. I can't say it is because of the coconut oil, but since coconut oil has become part of our lives here, we continue to use it and enjoy whatever health benefits we can gain from using it. I like this brand and will continue to use it in our household.", "id": 16320351}

{"review": "I recently stumbled across a pretty helpful health & wellness blog. I had already tried, and was well impressed by, several of their health tips (or life hacks) when I stumbled across the \"Oil Pulling\" article. For those of you who haven't heard of oil pulling, \"it is is an ancient Ayurvedic remedy for oral health and detoxification. It involves the use of pure oils as agents for pulling harmful bacteria, fungus, and other organisms out of the mouth, teeth, gums and even throat.\" At first I was confused by the concept and kind of disgusted by the thought of swishing oil around my mouth for a lengthy amount of time. The experience just didn't sound appealing at all but I figured, why not try it? I am in my late 20's now and didn't start taking oral hygiene very seriously until a few years ago so my teeth and gums can use all the help they can get. I have been oil pulling for a couple of weeks now and am glad I decided to give it a try. It is now part of my morning routine while I shower and get dressed and definitely before eating or brushing my teeth. Some people warm the oil up before putting it in their mouth to liquify it but I just take a spoonful of the oil as it quickly liquifies in the mouth. I have yet to see any differences in the color of my teeth but I do believe that my teeth feel healthier. Flossing has also become easier, which I assume is due to some of the layered oils before removed from the surfaces of my teeth. If you do purchase this coconut oil for oil pulling, make sure you do enjoy the taste of coconut. It has a very strong and sweet coconut flavor that does not fade during the process and it does leave a coconut aftertaste in your mouth as well. I wasn't a big fan of coconut flavor before but have gotten used to it through the oil pulling process. Oh, and make sure to NEVER swallow the oil after pulling. The coconut oil will contain all the bacteria and oils it pulls from your teeth so make sure you spit it out in the garage or into the sink while rinsing it down the drain with hot water.", "id": 16320351}

However, I've become alarmed when I open the newer boxes / packages- the bars are at least an inch shorter than they used to be. I thought maybe I had a few from the \"end of the roll\" or something, but it seems rather consistent now. The cellophane wrapper is the same size, but the bars are missing at least a full bite of what the bars used to be. And the prices keep going up.

They were so freakin delicious and they didn't come with the saturated fat of a candy bar. Then something changed from one order to the next. They became less pliable, more stiff. They're tougher, you have to wrestle a bite off of the bar like a dog attacking a bone. The taste is also quite bland in comparison to the older bars. Were they always gluten free? Perhaps that is it. I tried pawning them off on my coworker who can't have gluten, but he soon started passing when I offered them to him. So my relationship with KIND bars has regrettably reached its conclusion. It went from, 'order more of those next time!', to, 'you should just cancel that, no one eats them anyway'. I actually have some 5 year shelf life survival food I would rather eat than these. I gave one star in honor of the deliciousness that they once were...cue the bugles...farewell my friend, we had some good times hiking, quick on-the-go snacking, and general consuming to avoid having to cook.

{"review": "I would not use these as a meal replacement. Not enough protein, for one. But when I have them with a meal as dessert, no blood sugar spike. (I used to be prediabetic, and I do check these days to see how foods are affecting me.) But for folks who want a \"less crap\" candy bar or dessert treat, this one's it. VERY sweet. Tastes just like these chewy coconut candies my mom used to bring home in the 60s and 70s in my Bronx days. I used to love those. And I love the Almond Apricot for tasting like them. Every single variety I've tried--about a half dozen--are very good. But Almond Apricot is my fave. It hits the \"oh, candy\" and \"ooh, nostalgia\" vibe for me. My second fave (though it's gaining on the Almond Apricot in stealth mode) is the Almond Cashew Flax one. I thought I'd hate it (flax is not my fave thing), but man, it's like a gentle cookie taste in a chewy bar. It's quite delightful. I find I want to reach for that one for my evening \"dessert\" with coffee treat. Third fave: Mango Macadamia with Calcium. Very mangoey. Mangoes are my fave fruit and these do taste mango-ey. Macadamia is quiet enough in the taste department to let the fruit shine through. Different \"bite\" texture than the almond based ones, too. Smoother. (I'm a Caribbean born gal, and I've adored them since I was a wee one.) The peanutty ones are my least fave. I do find the cashew and almond based ones just are more enjoyable. If you low carb, you probably wanna steer towards, say, the Almond Coconut and have half (or one of the minis). It's not a lot of calories, and it's certainly a prettier nutritional profile for those who want a more \"whole food\"/no gluten lifestyle. (Beware the ones with peanuts if you're more into the Primal/Paleo side of things.) These babies are SWEET. If you're prone to abuse sweets like candy bars, don't even taste these. I'm serious. They're amazing. Addictive. Delicious! I've lost 116 pounds (moderte carbing, Primarian eating), and while I did order some (the minis, almond apricot, and others for hubby's lunch box), I think of them as CANDY. Not something to have in place of food, but something that I can have as a treat when I have the calories to allot. I also would happily carry a mini in my purse for emergencies. Because they have healthful fats, they can tide you over. How did they do on my glucose the way I use them (dessert): Premeal: glucose 81 Post meal: protein/veggies/fruit and one mango macadamia bar (after 1 hour): 88 Not bad. I wish they'd ratchet down the glucose/honey, cause they could be less sweet. BUT...I cannot tell a lie: THESE TASTE DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I almost wish I'd never encountered them.

Oil pulling is something you do in the morning before you brush your teeth. It's suppose to remove all the toxic from your body. I was a little skeptical at first, but I've been doing this faithfully for a year now , it's gives me lots of energy & it also help whiten my teeth too. First thing you do is take about a little less then half of spoon & swish it in your mouth between your teeth. Try not to swallow it. Don't swish like how you would with mouth wash . 2: I use it on my skin as a moisturizer . I know it sounds crazy, but hey it made my skin super soft. It can be a little greasy for the first 30 mins or so, but it works great! Some of you may think this is silly but, I just like to share what I think works for me and it may Work for others too.

{"review": "I'm very strict with my diet. I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients. I've tested 7 brands of organic coconut oil -- Nature's Way, Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, Bronner's, Ziggy Marley Organics, VivaLabs, and 2 small scale raw food companies. Nature's Way and VivaLabs are the best so far. The aroma of Nature's Way and VivaLabs both are wonderful. The texture is much fuller than the other brands. This coconut oil has bolder taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. I know that the way coconut oil (and all oils for that matter) is processed is very important. Better processing methods preserve more nutrients, increase the natural flavor and aroma, and improved digestibility. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is one by Nature's Way is excellent, as is VivaLabs brand too. Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is: 1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much work. Most fats require the body to work harder for digestion. Medium chain fatty acids energy the blood stream very quickly, with less digestion time than slow or long chain fatty acids, found in other oils. This makes coconut oil excellent for people missing gallbladders, having digestive problems or suffering from chronic fatigue. 2) Converts to usable energy very quickly. Coconut oil is a much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc). Carbohydrate break down quickly and elevate blood sugar and insulin levels rapidly. This creates the surge and crash. With coconut oil, the energy is delivered more slowly and evenly than carbs. Many people feel deeply nourished by coconut oil, like the food energy goes deeper within the body. 3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal. Coconut oil keeps your digestive system very clean inside. It will destroy candida, and common cold bacteria and flu viruses. This helps to balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria and gives the immune system support. Less sickness and more energy! 4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected. Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body. Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the \"eat every 3 hours\" cravings that so many people this is hunger. Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body. 5) Tastes great. Smells great. 6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft. Coconut oil is absorbed directly into the skin to nourish it (like a food for the skin), unlike most cosmetic moisturizers create a coating on top the skin. These often leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance. Coconut supports the skin's natural oil balance. This also helps to reduce wrinkles! 7) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner. Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the hair's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners. Plus, because coconut is anti-\"everything bad\" it will keep the hair clean too. Because there are so many different types of hair (dry, cracking, split ends, oily, curly, straight, etc) experiment with what works best. Try applying the oil only the the ends for extra protection from split ends. Or only to the scalp to stop dandruff (caused by scalp bacteria, often candida) or prevent hair loss. 8)Natural soap for the body. Myself, some of my friends and others use coconut oil as a soap for the body. Most bar soaps and liquid bath soaps remove the skin's natural oils and create dry skin. In fact, most people have dry skin and fail to see that the bath soap is causing it! We still need to clean our skin, but using coconut oil is better than soap in many cases. You may want to soap under the armpits, between the legs, on the hands and feet. But for the arms, legs, and torso (areas prone to dryness) try using only coconut oil. Here's the protocol that I use. 1) Dry skin brush my entire body before stepping in the shower, to remove dead skin cells and increase blood flow to the skin (redness is good). 2) Rise the body with hot water to open the pores and increase blood flow to the skin. 3) Use a wet cloth or your hand to rub the skin rinse clean any loose skin cells. 4) Turn off the water and use your fingers/hands to rub a light layer of coconut oil everywhere (minus your head hair). A light layer is all that is needed. Apply with your skin still wet and you'll see the water bead up. 5) Turn back on the water, this time to warm/cool, and rise off the excess coconut oil. Run your hand lightly over your skin to spread the excess coconut oil into places that may have less, and to help remove the excess altogether. Lightly is the key - you don't want to remove the oil completely. 6) Exit the shower and lightly tap dry your skin with a towel (do not rub your take off the oil) or air dry. The skin will absorb the coconut oil in a few minutes. Your skin will be soft to the touch and not oily. Don't worry, coconut is not like other oils - it won't stain your clothes or make them smell rancid. 9) Sunscreen and suntan lotion. Coconut oil protects the skin from the effects too much sunlight. Technically, coconut oil does not block the sunlight, like a UV sunblock would. Instead it prevents the harmful chemical reaction skin bacteria and skin fungus can have when exposed to the suns UV rays. It also moisturizes the skin, reflects back some light (the shine), and prevents sunburn. Personally, I lay out in the summertime sun in Arizona, Florida and Hawaii and when wearing coconut oil I can be out for 4-6 hours and not burn. In these powerful suns, 30 minutes to 1 hour of exposure without coconut oil and my skin is red and will peel days later. Although coconut oil does not block UV, it does wonders to protect the skin and create a great tan. 10) Can be used as a sexual lubricant. Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem. 11) Coconut oil detox cleanse. The medium chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-\"everything bad\" properties. The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day). The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well. You can find the instructions by Googling \"Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse\". This is a very powerful detoxification because the bad guys are being killed by the oil. So be mindful. That's it! I hope you enjoyed this review. The bottom line is that coconut oil is simply amazing! Nature's Way and VivaLabs brands are the best I've found so far. Enjoy! *** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil. Visit coconutdiet (dotcom)", "id": 1084128}

The remedy for that could be to use it sparingly on your face or to not use it on your face at all. Pay attention to your face and make the best decision for your facial situation. I still use it as a body moisturizer- from the neck down- and I love it. Be careful when you put it on your scalp because the oil will/can drip down the side of your head near your temples and cause break outs there, too.

I only use these for diaper changes.... whereas other wipes I use to wipe faces, hand, counters, high chairs etc. These wipes were great on cleaning my child's skin! I will be buying this specific type of wipe again!", "id": 1297811011}

{"review": "Out of the dozens of brands of toilet paper I've tried, my favorite toilet paper has always been Charmin. To me, it feels the best and I've never had any issues with it. However, Charmin is not always cost effective. I remember growing up as a kid, my mom would only buy Charmin when it's on sale. Even to this day as an adult, I do the same thing (buy in bulk when on sale). Recently this time around, my 6 month supply of Charmin was nearly out and it wasn't on sale at my local retailers... so I had to come up with something in a pinch (else we wouldn't have any toilet paper, which is bad news bears). I ended up looking to Amazon and despite looking up Charmin, noticed there was a $3 off coupon for this Quilted Northern. Plus w/ Subscribe & Save, I was essentially getting $6 off the list price meaning I'd get 48 rolls for under $20. For that reason alone, that is why I pulled the trigger to buy this. Now for those of you reading other reviews (and other people complaining about the size), these are double rolls. I'm not a Costco member, so I don't know what they sell but relatively speaking, I'm used to Charmin Mega Rolls.

This surprised me, especially since I got it cheaper than I could have purchased Charmin. What I also like is that this toilet paper is triple-ply. Generic TP is single-ply or very thin double-ply. Charmin (both Ultra Strong & Ultra Soft varieties) are double-ply. I will admit even with Charmin Ultra Strong, I've found that it sometimes rips easily.

{"review": "These refills are ok. The system works pretty well at reducing odors...but I just can't cope with the idea of continuing to spend $7-11+ for four bags (which is what we get from each one of these refills). I decided to try buying kitchen-size trash bags with an odor-block feature. I put the kitchen bag down through the chute and tuck the top around the top of the area that you open to install an official refill. Then when the whole thing is full, instead of tearing the bag and knotting it to start a new one, I just take the old bag out and put a new bag in. Turns out it works fine. When the diaper genie is full it is the equivalent of 1/2 a kitchen trash bag! Since I bought the kitchen bags specifically for the diaper genie, I don't feel like I need to fill the other half of the bag to get my money's worth or something...but, just saying, each of the official refills basically holds less than two kitchen trash bags worth of diapers. For $7-11+. So, with the official refill you're spending $1.75-2.75 per bag, and you have to do the awkward cut and tie with a full bag of diapers, but it looks a little prettier because no portion of the bag is exposed outside the system. With Hefty 45 Count 13 Gallon Cinch Sak® Tall Kitchen Bags E86755 you're spending .17 per bag, and it is less awkward, but it is not as pretty because top of the bag shows outside the system. I guess it just depends on what is important to you, but we'd much rather have the top of the bag show and get 10 times as many bags for the same price. This also means that we don't have to remember to buy bags often at all. We just bought a box of 45 bags and it's lasting quite a while.", "id": 166768011}

{"review": "I have a newborn and just finished my second refill. She is 6 weeks old. I know how many diapers I've been through because I've tossed almost all of her diapers at home (still don't get out much). I'm just starting a 5th case of 88 newborn diapers. That means I've gone through 4 cases of 88 each = 352 diapers. 352 diapers in 42 days = 8-9 diapers a day (that sounds about right). Anyway, my point with the above calculation is that I got about 175 diapers in each refill. Not at all 270. Maybe they packed them airtight - but through normal use, I think it's far less than 270. And of course, once she gets into larger size diapers, it will be even fewer. So what does this mean? Based on current pricing, it means I'm paying another 3.5 cents PER DIAPER for my diaper genie. And that's newborn size. If you are someone sitting there calculating your per-diaper costs, you may not think much about what it costs you to toss it. Then again, even at 3.5 cents per diaper, you're still talking about maybe 30 cents a day. That's worth it to me. I like my diaper genie a lot and I do find these refills convenient. But if you tend to look for ways to get that 19 cent diaper instead of 22 cents or whatever, this adds a lot (relatively) to the cost. Might want to try the regular trash bag trick that another reviewer mentioned.", "id": 166768011}

I don't know what people are talking about that these aren't the same thing because they look exactly the same as the ones that originally came with our diaper genie from Babies R' Us. We had no problems with them fitting and they are far cheaper to purchase on Amazon than they are in our local stores. I will definitely buy them again. Just make sure your buying them for the right Diaper Genie specified and you should have no problems. EXTRA $$$$ Saving HELPFUL TIP: To get the most use out of these I don't use the cutter mechanism on the diaper genie because I was noticing that it wasted too much of the refill. Instead I keep a pair of scissors nearby and cut it when the bag needs changing. These really extends the life of my refills.

{"review": "This is the second reduction in quality Sparkle has made in the last six months. First it was the paper quality, now it's the quantity. The so-called giant rolls, which used to be 121 sq. ft. with 144 select-a-size sheets per roll, are now only 114.4 sq. ft, with 107 larger-sized sheets per roll. So each roll now has 6.6 sq. ft. less paper and 37 fewer sheets per roll. The sheets have gone from 5.5\" wide to 7\" wide, so what you do get goes faster, as well. If you're looking for the same small sheets to stretch out your paper usage, you'll want to take this into consideration. The cynical side of me says they made the size change to make consumers use the rolls faster, but it may actually be helpful due to the fact that since Sparkle towels became much thinner and coarser, I've found myself having to use two of these lesser quality towels where one previously sufficed. A bit more paper in the larger sheets helps reduce that problem a bit, but defeats the economical purpose of buying select-a-size. Either way, they're not the good deal they used to be. They're still slightly better than some grocery store house brands, which are like toilet paper, but with this ridiculous reduction in quantity for essentially the same price, one can buy the much better quality Bounty on sale at a local grocery store for nearly the same cost, which I intend to do next time.", "id": 13900811}

So each roll now has 6.6 sq. ft. less paper and 37 fewer sheets per roll. The sheets have gone from 5.5\" wide to 7\" wide, so what you do get goes faster, as well. If you're looking for the same small sheets to stretch out your paper usage, you'll want to take this into consideration. The cynical side of me says they made the size change to make consumers use the rolls faster, but it may actually be helpful due to the fact that since Sparkle towels became much thinner and coarser, I've found myself having to use two of these lesser quality towels where one previously sufficed. A bit more paper in the larger sheets helps reduce that problem a bit, but defeats the economical purpose of buying select-a-size. Either way, they're not the good deal they used to be. They're still slightly better than some grocery store house brands, which are like toilet paper, but with this ridiculous reduction in quantity for essentially the same price, one can buy the much better quality Bounty on sale at a local grocery store for nearly the same cost, which I intend to do next time.", "id": 2358141011}

She was in Cruisers size 3 and then size 4 during the day, and Huggies Overnight at night (she was soaking her cruisers at night, and Huggies Overnights are definitely the best!) I've had the chance to compare the Swaddlers to the Cruisers in size 4, and I can see the differences when I look at the diaper itself. The Swaddlers are more padded (thicker), whereas the Cruisers have a strong elastic. And of course the Swaddlers have that yellow/blue stripe to tell you when the diaper is wet. Personally I don't really need that stripe at my daughter's current size. The days of teaspoon-sized pees in stationary babies asleep in a crib are long gone, and if she's wet, I kinda know. Swaddlers: Thicker, Yellow Stripe Cruisers: Thinner, more elastic Both: Perfect for my long & lean 13 month old - no leaks (21 lbs ... I move up diaper sizes early) Neither: Neither is great for overnight for a toddler who actively soaks a diapers. But that's why there are overnight diapers! Overall I can't say I have a preference between the two. If you love swaddlers and/or really want the stripe, then stick with swaddlers and don't worry that you should move to cruisers because your baby is crawling/walking. If you use cruisers and are happy, don't let the fact that you can get swaddlers in size 4 make you question which is better. In my opinion there really isn't much of a difference. The Swaddlers are just as good for my very active 13 month old. Choose your diaper on price or on the cartoon character on the front or whatever you care about. I really don't think there is functionally much of a difference between Swaddlers and Cruisers.", "id": 166772011}

{"review": "We have been Swaddler fans since day 1 and currently in size 5. Target was the only store to carry the size 5 until recently. I was excited to see that Amazon and other stores would be carrying the size 5 when Target placed their boxes on clearance. Apparently they went on clearance because a newer version was taking it's place! The newer Swaddler, in my opinion is simply horrible. First the packaging and character strip is different. Obviously those things are not a big deal, however the inside now has a mesh lining, what they call the \"absorb away liner\". When wet or dirty this liner stretches, sags and sticks to the skin. This liner does not wick away the moisture or protect the skin at all!!! We never let our son sit in a dirty diaper, we are constantly changing him when the strip turns blue so this isn't a matter of not changing often. Since the newer Swaddler our son has suffered diaper rashes and his skin is so raw and red. We have since switched to something better for us. Too bad I have half a box left and just returned a full box to Amazon. I did email Pampers directly and received a very bland response which didn't even address my concern. Bad move P&G on both your product and customer service!", "id": 166772011}

{"review": "We have been a huge Swaddler fan & advocate since day 1 - always telling every mom I know to use pampers Swaddlers. But the new Swaddler, is awful!!!! 1) The diaper has a weird chemical smell instead of the nice baby powder smell. 2) Now the diaper sags even when it's not very full. 3) The liner does not wick away the moisture at all. My daughter's bottom is always shining with wetness from her urine and I change her frequently....so much that my mother and my mother-in-law tell me to chill out. My daughter has only had 2 small diaper rashes since she was born & one blowout, and since the new Swaddler she has suffered recurring diaper rashes, and they are severely red & multiple near blowouts even with small bowel movement. 4) Pampers has increased the price by reducing the # of diapers per box. I have stopped my Subscribe & Save subscription from Amazon. I just got my last shipment and I will be returning them. I am terribly disappointed. Please change them back and I will purchase them again!!!", "id": 166772011}

Great commercials but crummy diapers) and to ONLY use pampers, especially swaddlers. However, in the past couple weeks my son has been having horrible blow outs (Top of the diaper) so I was thinking he needed to be in a size up (he’s in a size 4), even though he is perfectly in the weight range. However, he has also been suffering from extreme diaper rash, so bad he would shake when we wiped him, and the cream that always worked in the past didn’t even help: For him and my older daughter (who only used pampers) RARELY had diaper rashes, either very tiny and gone with a touch of cream but these bad rashes are now so common and come to realize, only since our most recent shipment of pampers arrived in February. After reading other reviews and putting the pieces together, these \"Improved Changes\" are awful and my son gets to suffer:( and I get to do more laundry... And like other unhappy customers, there really aren’t many options of better diapers, which is SAD...Pampers should go back to their original QUALITY product, as I am going to start shopping around and find a better (non diaper rash creating) fit for my son.", "id": 1297811011}
{"review": "My husband and I had bought enough of the old version of size NB and size 1 Swaddlers to last us about 5 months. They were fantastic - not one complaint. I raved about Pampers and recommended them to all my friends. Then, about a month ago, we ran out and had to order the new version. Every single day, our daughter came home from daycare in a different outfit than we sent her in because poop leaked out the back of the diapers. We switched from size 1 to size 2, hoping that would alleviate the problem. No such luck. I randomly decided to read reviews on here today. Apparently this is a problem for a lot of people with these new and \"improved\" diapers. As soon as we make our way through the diapers we have, we will be looking for a new brand of diapers. And I'm sure Pampers is going to respond like they did for every other 1 star review and tell me to call and provide more information. No thanks.

{"review": "My daughter is almost 6 months old and since she was born, I've had the opportunity to try hundreds of brand-name diapers that were given to me at my diaper party. These diapers ranged from Huggies, Pampers, and Luvs. Within the Huggies & Pampers line, I had different \"models\" at my disposal, such as Pampers Swaddlers & Pampers Baby Dry as well as Huggies Little Snugglers, Huggies Snug & Dry, and even Huggies Snug & Dry Plus. However now that I've run out of those, I am now purchasing my own diapers. Based on my experiences, Pampers Swaddlers are ***THE BEST*** diaper I've used thus far. And because of that, I will never go back to any other diaper. I've literally given my unused packages/boxes of Huggies diapers to local charities for those in need. The reason I love Pampers Swaddlers is that they are the *ONLY* diaper that does not leak. The fit absolutely perfect and I've never had an issue with them. EVER! However, this is not to say that all Pampers diapers are good. I've tried Pampers Baby Dry, which is a more economical version of their diaper, and that diaper does not come close to the performance of the Swaddlers line. Baby Dry would would leak and/or sag to cause more leakage. The Huggies brands however, are even worse. I can't tell you how many times my daughter's daycare had to change her clothes due to constant leakage of the diaper (EVEN WITH 2 hour change intervals). Huggies is simply garbage because it soaks up literally nothing. I'm left to wonder if various boxes of the Huggies diapers I've used even has any sodium polyacrylate in them. FYI, sodium polyacrylate is the \"super absorbent polymer\" that absorbs moisture in all brands of diapers. While Pampers Swaddlers would \"bulge up\" and absorb my daughter's urine, the Huggies line never bulged up. Meaning they never absorbed anything. Leading to the urine-soaked clothes that my daughter experienced every day. The color-changing wetness indicator is a nice touch. The equivalent brand version of Huggies that has this is the Little Snugglers. But just as I mentioned in the previous paragraph, it leaked and never seemed to fit right on my baby. Although I'd pull them up as high as they could go, there seemed to be a huge \"pocket\" around my baby's bottom, which would be one of the reasons for the sag/leakage. Another reason I like the Pampers Swaddlers is their shape allows for a snug fitment. Pampers is the only diaper with \"tags\" on both ends to provide a 360 degree full fitment around the waist. No other brand of diaper I've seen does this. The Pampers Swaddlers line goes all the way up to size 5. I'm glad because it's the only diaper that I trust. So I'll be buying these until my daughter grows out of them. I stand by my review 100% and have NEVER been disappointed by the Swaddlers line.", "id": 166772011}

{"review": "We have used Pampers Swaddlers diapers since my baby was born. We used sizes P-S, then 0, then 1, and then 2, and had no problems at all.

We moved the Pampers diapers to the garage and went to our local Whole Foods to purchase a small pack of eco-friendly diapers, which seemed so overpriced compared to Pampers.

{"review": "I love nuts and dark chocolate, so for me this was a no brainer. These aren't big enough for a meal replacement for me personally, but for some dieting or trying to do whats right and eat a breakfast in a hurry these are a great option. If you still eating those chewy granola bars, don't you think it time for an adult bar? The taste on this is great as you get the crunch from the nuts, the sweet and smooth from the chocolate, and sweets favorite companion salty. The only negative thing I could say is these do cost a good bit, but in my opinion it is worth it. Pros: -Natural ingredients -Minimal sugar -Great taste -Healthy fat, protein and fiber Con: -Cost -Not filling enough for a meal replacement. Overall five stars as it is a great product and I will continue to use it as a morning snack.", "id": 7090289011}
{"review": "Kind bars are exceptional, but this is the very best of the Kind bar offerings. The sea salt and dark chocolate mix makes it a delicious mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. And best of all it's gluten free, all natural and low sodium. A good choice all around.", "id": 7090289011}
{"review": "The offer said, Free Sample of Kind Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar, 1.4 Ounce, so I clicked on it, wondering if it was truly a freebie. It wasn't but I ordered a couple of them anyway. More on this \"free sample\" offer later, but how good are they? Subjective Taste Test: Perhaps this is a little unfair as I've tested the KIND Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar before. Bought a couple of them at a local store some time ago and found that they were a good snack alternative to my regular Clif Bar Energy Bars when out cycling. And followers of his show will already know that Dr. Oz, recommended KIND and keeps some in his briefcase at all times. As far as taste goes, these are good, nice and chewy with a decent nut flavor, and the dark chocolate is not sickeningly sweet as one will find with some products. I have a thing for sea salt, and the combination of that with the nuts and dark chocolate works... and they don't leave a bad artificial aftertaste. Nutrition Stats: Checked the KIND site and found the following ingredients were listed for this product: Mixed nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts), chicory root fiber, honey, palm kernel oil, sugar, crisp rice, cocoa powder, non GMO glucose, sea salt, soy lecithin, milk powder, vanilla extract.

But they weren't free, so I figured that I had just missed some special deal. They were being sold by Amazon LLC for $1.49 each at the time, with free two-day shipping for Amazon Prime members, and since I've tried them before, picked up a couple of them. Now I see that the original Amazon deal is gone, and has been replaced by a third party offer. At the time of this review, they are being sold for \"$1.59 + $5.95 Est. shipping\" and available at an external website. That comes to $7.54 per bar. So much for the \"free sample\" being offered here. This deal reminded me of something else. Do you remember Vince Shlomi, also known as the \"ShamWow Guy\" and the one in the Slap Chop infomercials that we used to see? Television's fastest talker used his double entendre signature line \"You're gonna love my nuts!\" so often that people bought the product... often to their dismay. I like the KIND bars as noted above, but with the deal being currently offered here, it's reminiscent of that one from the \"ShamWow Guy\" a bit too much. There is another deal here on Amazon for KIND Nuts & Spices, Dark Chocolate Nuts & Sea Salt, 12-Count Bars which is far better; just do the math, as it comes out quite reasonably if you want a dozen. They have been endorsed by Al Roker, Dr. Oz and other nutrition folks, but luckily we don't hear them saying \"You're gonna love my nuts\" on their television segments. 9/23/2012", "id": 7090289011}

The nuts had a slightly off flavor and they were so hard that i was worried about my teeth.

{"review": "My biggest surprise when opening the package was 3 HUGE wipe bags...in the past I usually get bags of 70-80 or so. They do have a zip-lock seal...but knowing how fast these things dry out I put my open one in a 5 gal zip-lock bag. They are perforated (like toilet paper) rather than tri-fold....so each piece is connected to the next...making it extremely hard to pull it out of the slot on the wipe container. We have resorted to opening the lid entirely up and grabbing the length that we need. These wipes seem thinner than the Sam's Club, Pampers or Target and tear very easily. I had a coupon so at 1cent/unit/piece it was about 50% less than what I pay for the other brands I mentioned. Haven't decided if the savings are worth it.", "id": 677974011}

{"review": "I have used Huggies for many years and always loved them. I ordered this 648 refill pack because I thought it was a good price deal, but the Huggies are NOT the same! This is a box of three refill bags of 216 wipes each, and each bag is exactly the same height as a refill of 184 wipes that I bought elsewhere. Which tells you what? That these wipes are THINNER! In fact, it took 5 flimsy wipes to do the job that one used to do! Remember when Huggies filled that plastic dispenser box? Now there is plenty of extra room for the wipes to flop around in there because they are shorter, narrower, and thinner! Hey, manufacturers, we customers would rather have to pay MORE than see our favorite products get skimpier and skimpier for the same price, whether it's Huggies, breakfast cereal, or candy bars.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "These wipes are great at wasting time and wasting themselves, that's about it. I don't have time while wiping a child's rear to worry about carefully pulling up on the wipe so it does not tear, just enough so that the next one comes out the top, since these have a habit of falling back into the container. If that happens you would think you could just stick a finger in there next time and grab the chain again like every other brand.... NOPE, stick a couple fingers in that dispenser and you'll first put giant holes in the paper thin wipes and also come out with just a torn fingerful of the top layer. Useful for sure while the child kicks at your groin and sticks their foot into the dirty diaper while you tear off the lid of the dispenser. But be careful, if you pull too hard while dispensing you get 15 wipes bunched together from poor folding design, and careful don't pull too far or you will dry out the next one. Also useless is the perforation. Who needs double sized wipes? How large is the child's behind?? Just take two, its more sanitary than dragging a gigantic chain of deformed, holey, simply-clean-wipes through the mess, tearing as they go so your hand gets covered in poop. Purchased in the \"resealable bags\" these are a huge pain to refill as they don't fit by the bag in their own provided container and you know you have plenty of spare time to eyeball that and tear off a moist pile of wipes then reseal a cheap zip lock carefully. Hey just put the entire bag in your diaper bag. Its only 500 wipes or so, takes up half the bag and weighs 5lbs. Very convenient. But do these wipe poop well? If they stay in one piece they are about as useful as wet toilet paper, and they didn't cause a rash for us. So if you have time to spare and those are your standards go wild, buy em.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "Great wipes! I love huggies wipes in comparison to other brands. They have the perfect blend of thickness and moisture.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "Do not like these wipes at all, they become tangled up with each other and do not come out one by one from the refill package. Everyone's children are a little different but these were quite harsh on my baby's skin. Compared to the other wipes that we've used, Pampers and Kirkland's signature, we both had to use a significant amount more of the Huggies wipes to achieve a good clean butt as compared to the other brands. Ended up giving away two of the four boxes we purchased and ended up using the two boxes for miscellaneous uses besides wiping our baby's butt.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "I ordered these back in March, and again in July. We just now opened the most recent order, and they are completely different quality. These new ones tear when pulling them out of the container, and when I'm cleaning the babys bottom, my fingers tear right through. Not very pleasant. They also don't do as good of a job cleaning. I'm finding myself having to use 3 or 4 on a dirty diaper, rather than 1 or 2 like with the first order I had. I don't know if it is a bad batch or what, but they aren't good at all.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "Worst wipes I have ever used. They dry out fast. They are small. They tear easily. They don't clean well. I had no idea wipes could be anything but just normal wipes but obviously I've been somehow spoiled by our Costco wipes. I bought these because I've always been told you should stock up any time wipes were below 2 cents a piece and there was a sale and a coupon, but, wow, bad move on my part. My husband and I both can't stand them.", "id": 677974011}
{"review": "Hey, yo... When I was in my early 20s, a girlfriend broke up with me because I was using the single-ply variety of toilet paper in a cost-saving measure. Living in New York City is very expensive. I learned an important lesson, you gotta step up your poop game. Take that S--- seriously. Pun intended. At a cost of $0.47/double roll, the Angel Soft Double Rolls (I purchased the 40-pack) this is a good way to step your game up on the cheap. I did extensive product testing comparing to the more expensive Charmin Ultra Strong Toilet Paper, Double Rolls, 40 Count. I use the restroom frequently, so I figured myself to be the perfect test subject. Below: Price: Angel Soft: $0.47. Charmin: $.71. If I had a quarter for every time I bought cheaper toilet paper... Oh wait I do, so that is a total of $.24 x 40 = $9.60. Almost enough to buy something useful like an Admiral Ackbar action figure. Softness: Angel Soft: 9/10. Charmin 8.5/10. Angel Soft with a shocking Wichita State-style upset here. The champion of crap has been dethroned Toughness/Resiliency: Angel Soft - 4/10. Charmin 8.5/10. This is the big weak point for the Angel Soft. Really can not stand up to daily use. Those are the only categories I could think of to judge Toilet Paper in. In all, it is a solid, if unspectacular product. I don't know how long it will take me to finish 40 rolls of toilet paper, but I can assure all my faithful readers that Stacie is very excited to have such a plethora of supplies. Doomsday Preppers here I come! Aside: I couldn't figure out a reasonable way to work this story into the review, but when I was in college my friends and I had a long debate about whether or not it was weird to wipe while standing up. I maintain this is perfectly normal but they thought I was the odd one. I'm not even sure I'm familiar with the mechanics of the seated wipe. Sorry for that visual. Discuss in comments. Update: 7/16/13 - I see that a) they have almost doubled the cost of this product (it was about $19 for 40 double rolls when I bought and reviewed it) and it is no longer prime-eligible. I would not purchase this product at this price. I will not deduct any stars because the star-rating is for the product not for the price/shipping. Update 11/15/13 - Back to a reasonable price. Ignore previous update.", "id": 15342981}
{"review": "Bought this 48 Count package of Angel Soft to stock up. I have been using this brand for years now, usually purchasing it at the local Red Bulls Eye store. I have to say here and now that this particular shipment of TP seems to have a slightly lower quality overall. The paper itself seems a bit more “post consumer”, and has a different feel and look to it. Not as soft as the same brand bought in my local Bulls Eye or Wally World stores. Not sure why that is, but we all know when our TP is different. I may be wrong here, but it leads me to believe perhaps it IS different from the stuff allocated to the larger chain stores. It also smells different. (no joke and I am talking PRE use here ok? ) Basically this reminds me of the Costco branded Campbell's soups which are slightly watered down versions of their regular soups. Just to see, I went and got a 24 pack to compare it with this lot and there WAS a difference. (also, you don’t get as much per roll for some reason) This will be my first and last time purchasing this particular item online.", "id": 15342981}
{"review": "We have used this brand for years; used to purchase from the grocery store, then have subscribed to Amazon for last 5-6 months or so instead. The product itself stinks very badly in the September shipment only. And I still have so much of it. I notice every time I put the tissue to my face to blow my nose or blot make-up. It is very unpleasant, and intolerable. The product is not musty or does not seem water damaged, etc after packaging. Instead the odor seems inherent to the product, as the smell occurs with all rolls, and throughout use of the entire roll. Perhaps it was just an anomaly with this shipment. So we will continue with November shipment to see if corrected. If it is not, we will not order this product ever again. I hope the manufacturer is not \"pawning off\" inferior product to Amazon customers in bulk. A secondary issue is also occurring: the size of the \"double\" rolls is diminishing over time. I thought I was imagining this, but I've compared rolls from a year ago to six months ago to Sep shipment. And the reduction in size is easily seen and measured. This is kind of insulting, but maybe is just an inevitable sign of the times with all manufacturers? Very disappointing anyway. For both of these issues - I blame Georgia Pacific, not Amazon. But want you to be aware. Frankly, I just don't want to spend this much time thinking about toilet paper. :)", "id": 15342981}

{"review": "After years of working in higher education, my cheeks have endured every cheap variety of \"bathroom tissue\" on the market. I often wonder who the jack-wagon who orders these cheap products is, because I'd like to slap the self-loathing right out of him (or her). I want to say to this sad little person, \"Do you hate yourself as well as everybody on this campus? Don't you also wipe your tuches? Are you calloused around the posterior and this sandpaper is your method of exfoliation?\" For years, on every campus, I have endured this rectal torture device. Thank the heavens I had Angel Soft waiting for me at home. Reasonably priced, and as soft as Cupid's sweet cheeks, I always buy it in bulk. I don't order it through Amazon, though. I proudly buy the largest bundle I can find from my local Target and hoist it high on my head like an African water-bearer, so that everyone can see the care with which I treat my tenderest area. Once these angels descended into my life, and I finally saw the light, I realized that I no longer had to cheese grate my dirty bum every time nature called in the workplace. I installed a special pocket on my leather book satchel, tailor made for my personal roll of Angel Soft. Now, the angels protect my bottom everywhere I go. No more sandpaper for me. Take that, toiletry-purchaser, whoever you are, you joyless bloody-bottomed punisher of bums.", "id": 15342981}
{"review": "Is this toilet paper like sandpaper? Nope Is it as soft as Charmin? Nope but it also won't clog your system either. It works fine. Is soft enough. And, when I bought it, it was the best price.", "id": 15342981}
{"review": "We're never buying angel soft toilet paper again. The last few packs we've bought have had major quality control issues. One time there was what looked like oil spilled all over several rolls (and no tear in the packaging so it didn't happen during shipment). Just now, with a four pack, there was what looked like dryer lint all over the rolls and some other foreign particles. It's disgusting. We have used angel soft for years and never had a problem. But obviously they have made a change in management, distribution, quality check (well, lack of one), etc. We did not buy from amazon but this is the biggest place for reviews so I felt I needed to say something because the problem is with angel soft...doesn't matter where it's purchased. This is toilet paper....who wants dirt, grime, lint, and who knows what on something you use to clean your unmentionables? GROSS.", "id": 15342981}
